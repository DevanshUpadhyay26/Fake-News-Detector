0,Studio planning reboot of show that hasn’t been created yet,"As studios across the industry have started to run out of unique ideas, they have decided to regurgitate older and slightly famous TV shows, sitcoms, and movie franchises they own the rights to. Superhero movies are playing the nostalgia card so often that fans don't even take the deaths of their computer-generated imagery (CGI) superhero in a CGI set seriously anymore. However, in the middle of this crisis, Generic Studios Ltd. has stood out by coming up with the idea of rebooting a show that hasn't even been created yet.

""Harry Potter's not been gone even a decade now. We've already had spinoffs, reunions, fan-fictions, plays and questionable tweets about it but they still aren't done milking that cow. They've milked Harry Potter more than proud Shahbagh University students milk their public university tags. Yet, we're getting a reboot,"" said Shadman Feige, CEO of Generic Studios Ltd.

""Studios have rebooted their TV shows and franchise more times than I've rebooted my computer with viruses. Fans are tired of it. They need something new and original! Sure, we could try hiring a bunch of new writers, brainstorming new ideas, and coming up with something that isn't a reboot, rip-off or sequel but the risk factor is just too high,"" he said. ""For a new show, I'd actually have to pay the writers and that's everything we stand against here at Generic Studios. My audience has an average attention span of six seconds. If I'm going to reboot the show in six years anyways, why not just skip the original and make the reboot first?""

Generic Studios is also aware of the diversity needed in their casting choices.

""We want to make sure our project is marketable to gullible teenagers across the globe. People in Asia go crazy over their favourite actor having a screen time of six seconds in a Hollywood project. So, we've decided to pick one actor from every major industry across the globe without caring about whether they even fit the character description or not.""

Shadman also spoke about the budget, ""About 20 percent of the budget involves green screens and the rest of it in marketing. If we have any spare changes left, maybe we'll even consider paying the overworked VFX artists. Let's face it, the audience couldn't care less about the CGI as long as there are a hundred cameos in the film. Most of the superhero films these days look like early 2000s Disney films. Yet, they work wonders! Is it solely because of the naivety of their fanbase? Sure. But it's also because of the hundred cameos they shove in each film.""

Meanwhile, fans are reportedly very excited about the reboot of their favourite franchise that doesn't even exist in the first place.

""The social media is already riled up about the casting of a person of colour and how it isn't book accurate, although the show isn't based on a book. The 18th reboot of Genericman is also coming later this year. I can't wait to see the generic superhero's father figure die for the umpteenth time on the big screen! A brand-new superhero movie about a comic book character I didn't know existed until last week was also announced and I'm super excited. It's a good year for a movie-goer with an IQ below room temperature.""

1,Critical thinking in our curriculum: Too much or too little?,"Critical thinking has always been emphasised heavily in education and with good reason. It is known to improve creativity, foster curiosity and enhance decision-making. Another benefit of mastering this ability is that it's universally relevant across all professions and fields.

Being a critical thinker has ramifications outside of academic and professional surroundings as well. It's easier than ever for fake news to spread and more than a little difficult to determine what is correct, given the overwhelming number of information sources. The amount of misinformation circulating around the pandemic should serve as an eye-opener in this regard.

There has been constant debate about whether the quality of our national education is up to par with global standards, as well as attempts to reinvent it. Thankfully, the NCTB has been going through a much-needed overhaul, starting from 2022.

Here's a little recap: in the revised framework, there will be no public exams before class 10 and no exams of any kind for students up to class 3. SSC exams will consist of five subjects, while HSC will be held in two phases. The division of science, humanities and business studies will occur from class 11 instead of 9. All these revisions are reportedly devised to facilitate holistic learning and improve creativity and competence.

The current creative question system was introduced in 2008 to promote critical thinking and discourage rote memorisation. Whether it has achieved that goal is debatable. The answer may be leaning towards a firm no, considering the amount of criticism the curriculum has received over the years.

Infrequent revisions have exacerbated its existing flaws like outdated syllabuses and textbooks riddled with errors. The creative questions are usually creative in name only, since educators encourage memorisation over all else, and that is what students are judged on, not their analytical capacity. The extent of memorisation unfortunately stretches to subjects like English and Bangla as well.

The system also fails to give teachers the necessary guidance and training required to make exams that test students' critical and analytical thinking ability. To make matters worse, there are no universal guidelines to mark these questions provided to examiners either.

Replacing memorisation culture with a more updated system is a necessary goal, but whether it's practical in our geographical context is a glaring issue. While students in Dhaka are equipped with the best schools, teachers, and coaching centres, students outside of the capital barely receive a fraction of the academic support. The more you move towards the rural side of our country, the further the discrepancy widens. There are already doubts about whether the recent changes can be implemented in these areas due to lack of space, funding, and technology. Further modernisation might put strain on schools which are already struggling.

Some of the recent changes to the national curriculum have been welcome ones. Whether they affect everyone equally remains to be seen.

2,The waffle-on-a-stick revolution,"Waffles on a stick are popping up at every corner of Dhaka city, slowly becoming the newest street food sensation. If you haven't tried one yet, you should seriously consider it because the crunchy little baked squares on popsicle sticks coupled with mouthwatering colourful toppings are irresistible.

I had been planning to go on a dessert run to satisfy my sweet tooth, so I decided to make a day out of tasting waffles. I visited the highest-rated waffle places that have been taking Dhaka's foodgram by storm.

My journey began at Waffle Time, Dhanmondi. Needless to say, I was feeling a little adventurous so I went with the red velvet waffle topped with whipped cream and red velvet crumbs. The first plus point was that it looked exactly as delectable as it looks on the menu but I didn't expect it to be as sweet although the crunchy texture and the gooey cream melted right into my mouth.

Next on my list was Waffle Street which took me all the way to Mirpur-1, to try their Nutella Ice Loaded, which was the most expensive one on their menu. It was a Nutella-coated waffle that came with vanilla ice cream, drizzled caramel, and chocolate sauce as well as banana cubes and chocolate chips as toppings. Given the price and the journey, it was quite the mouthful. The waffle got a little messy to eat out of a stick as the ice cream was melting fast. And so, I was compelled to use a fork and a spoon.

The final station of my sugar rush was at Waffle Up's flagship outlet in Banani. I wanted to save it till the end because that's where I had my first-ever waffle on a stick last summer, so it made perfect sense for it to come full circle. Their classic Nutella Waffle that comes with a teal interior tasted rich, fluffy, and as sweet as you would expect it to be. It balanced out my palate, being simpler than my experimental rendezvous throughout the day.

The taste of the individual waffles is comparable because there is little variation in flavours, with the toppings usually having a Nutella or whipped cream base of a classic waffle batter. As for the menu prices, they are between BDT 150-200, well below regular waffles.

You might want to think twice before getting extra syrup or Nutella add-ons because they can at times overpower the taste. It's also best to steer clear of runny toppings when you're having waffles on the go. Not only do they run the risk of spills, but the waffle could also get soggy and come off the stick.

The outlet's kiosk-like structure with signature funky wallpapers accented by vibrant LED strip lights provides a perfectly cosy and inviting atmosphere for a budget date or a snack out with your friends. So, if you're craving a sweet, delicious, and affordable snack on the go, treat yourself to your nearest waffle joint.

3,The Setting Sun: Dazai’s depiction of the dusk after the end of war,"*Trigger Warning: The following contains mentions of self-harm and substance abuse

The year was 1947, two years since the Second World War. Becoming the only nation in the world to bear witness to nuclear wrath, Japan remained a nation of scorched pride, ash, and rubble. As the country came to terms with the ravages of war and the humiliation of defeat, a novel would be penned that would encapsulate it all. This novel would make an obscure author into an instant celebrity and become eponymous for the death of a nation and its rebirth.

""Last year nothing happened.

The year before nothing happened.

And the year before that nothing happened.""

In these words, Kazuko, the main character, describes her traumatic experiences with the war. Yet her world has changed in the most profound of ways.

Erstwhile members of the Japanese aristocracy, Kazuko and her family are now a household in crisis. They have had to start anew in the countryside, far removed from their life of comfort and plenty. Kazuko's days are spent doing household chores and caring for her ailing elderly mother. She is conflicted about her feelings for her self-destructive brother Naoji, a war veteran whose only solace lies in addiction. She is torn apart by her obsessive love for Uehara, a hedonistic writer she met years ago. Her life is suffocated by a sense of dread and desolation.

However, even in hopelessness, there can be love and mundane joy. In stark contrast to the fantasy of a future filled with hope, there lies a desperate prayer for things to perpetually remain as they are. We are also shown an almost twisted form of happiness – the joy of losing everything and the relief of knowing nothing worse can ever happen. The liberation found at the end of the dark tunnel, even if no light is to be found. All things end. It is a curse that is also a blessing.

The Setting Sun is a book of contrasting symbolisms, of opposites that work in pairs. Kazuko and Naoji's frail mother represents the elegance of Japan's dying traditions, while the affectations of other intellectuals and aristocrats highlight their arrogant pretentiousness. All of these, in turn, stand in stark contrast to the coarseness of Uehara, his dissolute band of drunkards, and their disillusionment with the ways of the past. Then we have Naoji, who becomes the personification of moral failure and its ravages on society.

The book draws its philosophies from the conflicting tenets of Christianity and Marxism and twists them cunningly into agreement. ""Depravity"" becomes another word for ""love"", and madness and rationality coalesce until they are one and the same. The indomitable will to survive is set against the unshakable resolve to die, and the embellishment and affirmation of both are achieved with rare finesse.

""Man is born for love and revolution,"" declares Kazuko near the end of the novel. If she is to survive, she must accomplish both.

Dazai's The Setting Sun is a book about twilight. The twilight of the world as they saw it and of life as they knew it. It is a cynical account of decay and death but also a touching tale of vitality and life. In the end, the last hues of dusk must always give way to the onslaught of darkness. Yet if night is inevitable, why cannot the same be said for the breaking of the new dawn?

4,5 books exploring the found-family trope in fiction,"A cast of strangers come together as a family based on their common experiences, situations, and relationships rather than their kinship or blood relations

I was first introduced to the found-family category last year, courtesy of the book I had been reading then. Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine (2017) by Gail Honeyman—an emotionally rewarding novel about our neuro-divergent character, Eleanor, as she ambles her way through the mundanities of life alone. The found-family aspect in this book comes in a fairly subtle manner, to the extent that I was baffled to have the least anticipated character in the role of a protagonist.

This trope, in reality, is an assisting story plot wherein a cast of strangers come together as a family based on their common experiences, situations, and relationships rather than their kinship or blood relations. Ever since reading Eleanor Oliphant, I have been searching, penetrating, piercing the mighty world of cyberspace for similar books exploring this portion of fiction.

A Man Called Ove

Fredrik Backman

Atria Books, 2014

The foremost book that comes to mind while pondering the notion of a found-family is A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman. Originally published in Swedish, this translated work of fiction centres a curmudgeonly elder man, Ove, who finds his solitary, routine life upturned when an equally spirited young family moves in next door. Ove has staunch principles, stern regulations, and a short fuse. In the neighbourhood, his recognition lies as the bitter neighbour from hell. However, inhabiting behind his stoic exterior is a yawning well of sadness and a story. A story that leads him to form a connection with the chaotic family just outside his icy front doors.

The House in the Cerulean Sea

TJ Klune

Tor Books, 2020

When Linus Baker, a 40-year-old cat father working full-time as a caseworker at the Department in Charge of Magical Youth, is summoned by the upper management authority, the last thing he expected was to be given a case of six dangerous children, residing in an orphanage on Marsyas Island. These children are social outcasts, their eccentric identities intimidating to many. Arthur Parnassus, their charming and unfathomable guardian, will go out of his way to protect his wards at all costs. We accompany Linus on his voyage to not only the island but also inside the lives of these eccentric yet beautiful children and their caretaker, Arthur. What you might not frequently realise is that a family can be a surprise. A family can be yours.

The Breakup Club

Melissa Senate

Red Dress Ink, 2005

Four colleagues, one circumstance. Well, two of the four are already blood relatives, and the title of this book might be a suitable hint as to their predicament. Lucy, Miranda, Christopher, and Roxy all work for the same publishing house and are going through different stages of a breakup. A group of friends or strangers coming together as a menage is one of the most priceless experiences in this category of found-family and The Breakup Club by Melissa Senate is the ideal illustration of that. Romantic connections take a back seat to personal and friendly interactions in this lighthearted and truly hilarious novel.

The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society

Mary Ann Shaffer, Annie Barrows

Dial Press Trade Paperback, 2018

Similar to another of my best favourite novels, Love, Rosie by Cecilia Ahern (Hachette Books, 2006), this work of historical fiction by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows is a tale told in the warmth of letters and humour. In January 1946, while in quest of the subject matter concerning her next novel, writer Juliet Ashton comes across a letter from a stranger. It was hidden among the pages of a Charles Lamb book, and from that day onwards, Juliet and her new correspondence exchange letters, each receiving a look into the other's life. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society has a delightful, humorous, and profoundly human cast of characters—from pig farmers to phrenologists, many of whom are avid readers of literature, making it the exemplary book-club book.

The Witches of Moonshyne Manor

Bianca Marais

MIRA, 2022

The book begins on a pleasant, tedious morning. Queenie, the witch in charge of a group of five other octogenarian witches, warns them about their pressing mortgage difficulties and the possibility of a home eviction. For centuries, these mischievous witches have inhabited the Moonshyne Manor as their own, coexisting as a chosen family. Now in their latter years of greatness, their only wish is to be reunited with their sister, Ruby, a fellow who has been missing for 33 years. However, the local men's council is raising the issue and they want the witches to be gone. The witches, on the contrary, will not deter from a fight.

5,Mrinal Sen and the spirit of Mrigayaa,"In the realm of Bengali political cinema, few have left as indelible a mark as Mrinal Sen, a visionary artist who took films to new heights. As we commemorate the centenary year of his birth, it is a pleasure to delve into his profound contributions and explore one of his most remarkable creations, the film Mrigayaa.

Frantz Fanon, a prominent political philosopher, asserted that decolonisation is an inherently tumultuous path. He emphasised the crucial need to commence this process by decolonising our minds from the oppressive influences of evil as failure to do so may unwittingly turn us into agents of destruction. Simplifying our thoughts and breaking free from the shackles of colonisation allows us to embark on a journey towards true emancipation, ensuring that we reshape the world with wisdom rather than perpetuating further harm. The theme of Mrigayaa only reiterates this.

Set in 1930s Odisha, this film depicts a tribal village coexisting with tigers and boars. The story revolves around a British administrator who loves hunting. He befriends Ghinua, a skilled tribal archer. Offering a reward for killing a deer, the administrator unknowingly sets off a chain of events.

A rebellious nationalist named Sholpu, seeking refuge in the village, becomes a catalyst for conflict and is unjustly accused of committing a crime. Meanwhile, Ghinua's brave act to rescue his kidnapped wife Dungri, leads to his own tragic demise, highlighting the unfairness of rewards and punishments. This thought-provoking film delves into the moral quandaries faced by the oppressed tribal community. The film seems inspired by the Santhal Revolt and it becomes quite apparent as this comes up a few times in dialogues.

Mrinal Sen and his carefully crafted political films such as Pratidwandi, Interview or Calcutta 71 all have a theme of rebellion of the minority against the powerful oppressors but what separates Mrigayaa from his other films is that his direction allows the audience to immerse themselves in Ghinua's emotional journey, grappling with the internal conflicts and external pressures he faces. With its compelling narrative and nuanced exploration of human nature, Mrigayaa stands as a testament to Sen's mastery of storytelling and his ability to provoke contemplation and reflection in his audience.

Mrinal Sen skilfully portrays the intricate process of decolonisation by weaving a narrative of confusion and internal conflict within the community. Through subtle acts of rebellion, he signifies the gradual transformation taking place in their collective mindset. The community finds solace and inspiration in figures like Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu, who embody the spirit of rebellion and serve as a guiding force.

Their indomitable presence resonates deep within the souls of the community, fuelling the flames of change and providing a source of hope and determination.

As we honour the centenary year of Mrinal Sen's birth, let us celebrate his immense contributions to Bengali political cinema. Mrinal Sen is different from other filmmakers due to his ability to engage with social and political issues while maintaining a simplicity that remains accessible to audiences. His films possess a rare combination of intellectual depth and emotional resonance. Through his films, he not only captivated but also inspired viewers to question the status quo, fostering a spirit of critical thinking and social consciousness. With Mrigayaa, he once again demonstrates his remarkable talent for presenting complex ideas in a manner that is both sophisticated and simple.

6,Bigolas Dickolas and the power of a heartfelt ‘Read this NOW’,"One random tweet by a fan account has sent a 2019 book flying off the shelves, climbing bestseller charts

In the past few years, one of the more remarkable internet phenomena has been the speed with which something that finds virality is swept up and co-opted by marketing agencies. It has given us both the initially amusing but now played out shtick of brand accounts feuding with each other on social media, and the painfully cringe results of corporations trying to capitalise on the latest internet memes/trends. The latter, with its ""hello fellow kids"" approach and half-baked understanding of meme culture, has long been deemed an effective measure of when a meme can be declared dead.

These death knells are inevitable in an online and social media ecosystem where every moment of virality must be squeezed for all its worth. The irony of it all, however, lies in the fact that most viral moments are wholly irreplicable because of the unique circumstances they are a product of, and whatever ensues can imitate them in style, form, and content as much as it pleases without ever reproducing the same reaction or engagement.

The most recent example of this has been a tweet from Twitter user @maskofbun, who took to Twitter in the middle of the night to passionately recommend a book he had just finished reading. The tweet, accompanied by the cover of the book in question, This Is How You Lose the Time War (2019) by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone, read:

""read this. DO NOT look up anything about it. just read it. it's only like 200 pages u can download it on audible it's only like four hours. do it right now i'm extremely serious.""

It was not a tweet unlike hundreds of thousands of others flung on to the Twitter feed daily, especially by fans. But for whatever reason, the tweet blew up, amassing 17.6 million views and 144,000 likes at the time of writing. At the height of this snowball effect, it also propelled This Is How You Lose the Time War to #3 on the Amazon Bestseller list nearly four years after its publication. In several parts of the world, the book sold out after the Tweet went viral, and has sent publishers and marketing agents scrambling to make sense of it all.

Big names like Simon & Schuster left comments like ""Hello from S&S corporate marketing!"" below the original tweet, hoping perhaps to jump on the bandwagon. Several bookstores have placed gimmicky stickers and signs on their copies of This Is How You Lose the Time War with phrases such as ""As recommended by 'B.D. Wolfwood'"", in a similar fashion to how books often feature ""Pulitzer Winner"" or ""Winner of the Booker Prize"" stickers on their covers. Speaking of Pulitzers, several online media outlets also called the @maskofbun's tweet more influential than the Pulitzer at increasing sales. A TechCrunch article pointed out that the novella had shot up to a higher place on the bestseller list than Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver, which only recently won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.

Unlike BookTok, Book Twitter is generally not thought of as a platform that can drive sales, and therefore not taken into as much consideration by agents and distributors; as a result, Book Twitter discourse is largely free of ruthless corporate soliciting for paid collaborations. This only makes the Bigolas Dickolas event even more intriguing. Several emerging authors and creators have also been seen to tweet about waiting for their very own ""Bigolas Dickolas moments"", which gives rise to the question of what exactly led to something as simple as this tweet garnering attention of such a scale. Just to put it all into context: this was a fan account named (with an innuendo) after a character from the 90s manga/anime Trigun, which has been out of print for years, tweeting about an epistolary sapphic, time travel novella published in 2019 to critical acclaim.

A BookRiot article remarked that this was ""a complete fluke, something that is impossible to replicate,"" and yet, it got to ""the heart of what is so great about bookish social media at its best: the unbridled enthusiasm."" When it came to social media marketing, Bookstagram used to be the platform for recommending and blogging about books, but its hype (and thus influence) most likely began to decline sometime during the pandemic, only to be replaced by BookTok and its immense popularity.

However, ever since BookTok made it big, leading several books to go viral and become bestsellers, its contents have been flooded with filler videos intended to appease the algorithm. Where such uninspired filler itself has not driven away a part of the reader and consumer bases, BookTok's reliability suffers because of creator reviews becoming increasingly commercialised due to paid partnerships with companies only interested in driving sales; this has led to fans and followers trusting the recommendations of book influencers far less. In a way, corporations' vested interests stripped BookTok of the traits which made it capable of fostering bookish communities and spreading the word in the first place.

It was perhaps precisely this gap that was filled by Bigolas Dickolas Wolfwood's heartfelt recommendation on Twitter. It reminded me of the Bangladesh Bookstagram scene that once was, fuelled by word of mouth and posts from voracious readers all across the platform. In this way, the whole phenomenon is beyond even attempted replication. In the words of Twitter user @arctvros, ""you can't replicate this kind of traction from the inside bc you can't manufacture a genuine sense of joy and community"".

For those willing to see what all the hype is about, This is How You Lose the Time War is set in a post-gender world, categorised as queer sci-fi romance.

The incident also speaks to the power and creativity of fan culture, as the co-existence of Trigun and Time War in many of the same spaces now has resulted in fanart and cosplay featuring crossovers between the two fandoms. The authors of This Is How You Lose the Time War, and Amal El-Mohtar in particular, have been tuned in and engaged with the situation, following and hyping up every little development in either fandom.

As for @maskofbun, not only was he interviewed by the likes of Gizmodo and The New York Times, but Bigolas Dickolas and the power of mutual support were most recently mentioned at a speech during the prestigious Nebula Awards as well. The incident has also been given its very own Wikipedia section. He even caught the attention of Yoshihiro Watanabe, producer of Trigun Stampede, who tweeted that he too had caught wind of the drama and bought the book. Amal El-Mohtar has likewise tweeted about getting around to watching Trigun.

However, perhaps Bigolas Dickolas Wolfwood's most significant claim to fame (after, of course, his Time War recommendation) was perhaps his very own ""Victor Hugo saves Notre Dame"" moment. When he tweeted at Dark Horse Comics, gently nudging them to reprint the Trigun manga and even offering to ""do all the promotions and marketing"", Dark Horse was led to break the news that a reprint was already in the works, sending the manga/anime fandom into a frenzy.

It is interesting how not one, but two pieces of media that did not have much traction beyond their own fandoms had suddenly skyrocketed in popularity — Time War due to the recommendation, and Trigun for merely being associated with the recommender's account. When it was first published, This Is How You Lose the Time War had been well received, especially by critics as it went on to win the Hugo Award, the Locus Award, and the Nebula Award for best novella. Other than that, it largely flew under the radar until Bigolas Dickolas came in to save the day.

For those willing to see what all the hype is about, This is How You Lose the Time War is gorgeously written, with lyrical and poetic prose meditating on love, life, and history as it follows Red and Blue through time and space and their attempts to thwart each other's schemes, but gradually and increasingly fall in love. Although it is set in a post-gender world, the book is categorised as queer sci-fi romance and, as an avid lover of both queer fiction and all possible sci-fi subgenres, has long been on my own list of ""READ THIS NOW"" books.

This is also not the first time a book of queer fiction made a resurgence in literary markets due to social media recommendations. A year or two ago, The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller found widespread fame through TikTok, leading not only to skyrocketing book sales but also the indisputable establishment of BookTok as a platform capable of doing so.

While this incident and all that followed might sound like terminally online drivel to some, it is the current reality of the book and publishing industry that social media dialogue has the power and influence to significantly impact how the industry operates. In many ways, Bigolas Dickolas, the unprecedented success of a single Book Twitter incident, and the decline in trust and credibility among BookTok followers has shown corporates and companies much of what works and what does not.

It is now up to them to decide whether they will learn something from the evident chaos and unpredictability of the internet, as well as the power of community building and feral fan enthusiasm, or merely try to recreate and bank on another Bigolas Dickolas moment.

7,The 2023 Formula 1 season so far: Unquestionable Red Bull dominance,"The 2023 Formula 1 season is already five races deep, with last year's champions Red Bull Racing leading with a dominant and comfortable margin. Aston Martin have made genuine progress this season, jumping from 7th in last year's standings to 2nd. Meanwhile, the usual front runners Ferrari and Mercedes have failed to match the Bulls, rarely getting podiums.

Here's a quick overview of the races providing a clear picture of the current pecking order of the grid.

Saudi Arabian GP

After winning at Bahrain, Max Verstappen faced a transmission issue during qualifying and started the race from the 15th spot. He finished 2nd while his teammate Sergio Perez successfully held him off and won the race in Jeddah. Alonso finished a distant third. Both Mercedes finished in front of the Ferraris while both Alpines finished as the best of the rest. Kevin Magnussen managed to clench the final point near the end of the race. Meanwhile both McLarens had a woeful Sunday as backmarkers.

Australian GP

Verstappen took pole while Sergio failed to qualify due to a setup problem. Charles Leclerc beached his Ferrari in the first lap and collisions into the walls by Alex Albon and Magnussen caused two red flags, each at the early and finishing stages of the race respectively. The latter was followed by a chaotic restart where Sainz bumped into Fernando, Perez and Stroll ran off into the gravel trap, Sergeant rear-ended De Vries and the Alpines collided into each other, bringing their rather impressive stints to an end. The session was again red-flagged after all the carnage, and the race ended behind the safety car.

Verstappen won the Melbourne GP, with Lewis and Alonso in the podiums respectively. The McLaren duo had a change of luck as both Norris and the hometown hero Oscar Piastri finished up in the points, and Hulkenberg had a brilliant race, finishing between them in P7.

Azerbaijan GP

After a month's break caused by the cancellation of the Chinese GP, the F1 calendar resumed at Baku with a revised sprint format. The new format keeps only one practice session and introduces separate qualifying sessions for the sprint and feature races. Charles Leclerc blazed these sessions, setting poles in both instances and finishing in p2 and p3 respectively. Max finished in p3 in the sprint with a damaged car and p2 in the race after an unlucky stop right before the safety car deployment. Checo won a commanding victory, keeping Max at bay till the end of the race. Fernando finished P4, nearly missing out on another podium by eight-tenths of a second. It was again another race of attrition focusing on tire and fuel management.

Miami GP

F1 returned to Miami for the second time with a big reception from its growing American fanbase. Charles crashed in Q3 of qualifying and caused the session to end early with Verstappen and Valtteri Bottas unable to set their times. Max started from P9 and breezed across others up to P2 in 15 laps, ultimately winning the race with a domineering performance. Checo secured pole but had to settle for P2, and another impressive performance from Alonso brought him a fourth podium in five races.

The Alpines returned to the points while the McLarens again finished at the bottom. Haas scored on their home soil after a good showing from Magnussen who kept Leclerc in a much faster Ferrari behind him for a long period. Mercedes suffered in qualifying but bounced back in the race, whereas the Ferraris had a harder time managing their race pace. There were plenty of overtakes throughout the grid, but it was a rather lonely race for the podium finishers yet again.

The main takeaway from the season thus far is Red Bull's sheer dominance. They have developed a far superior car that's being driven by two highly skilled and hungry operators. Checo has certainly stepped up this season, and can perhaps be a challenger for teammate Max for the title if he can keep up the pace consistently. Not only is Fernando Alonso showing exceptional results in his Aston even at the age of 41, but he is also greatly motivating the team. Ferrari are close to the Bulls in qualifying trim but are nowhere near during the race with poor tire degradation. Meanwhile, Mercedes have had better luck in the race than in qualifying.

On a different note, Yuki Tsunoda has drastically upped his game, finishing consistently in 10th or 11th no matter where he starts from. Piastri is also showing promise as he has been able to hang near teammate Norris, but the other rookies have yet to impress. Nyck De Vries being such a capable driver in other categories has not performed as expected. McLaren and Alpine are exchanging positions for final points positions, with the other teams finishing close.

So far, this season is panning out to be very predictable for the championship win, but the midfield cars and backmarkers are much closer to each other. Many teams are bringing big updates for the Emilia Romagna (Imola) GP and are optimistic about their anticipated performance gains. Hopefully, those upgrades for the front-running teams in the upcoming races can bring them into contention for more podiums and race wins.",2023-05-15 14:00:30,https://www.thedailystar.net/shout/news/the-2023-formula-1-season-so-far-unquestionable-red-bull-dominance-3320901,2023-05-18 10:18:20,thedailystar

9,In conversation with Professor Imran Rahman,"Vice-Chancellor of University of Liberal Arts, Bangladesh (ULAB)

ULAB was shortlisted for the Times Higher Education Awards Asia 2023 for Outstanding Contribution to regional development. What has the University of Liberal Arts, Bangladesh (ULAB) been doing that has led to this?

Professor Imran Rahman: Times Higher Education is one of the leading university-ranking agencies in the world. When I saw the opportunity to submit a story from ULAB, I sent the notice to all our department heads. Professor Sumon Rahman, the director of ULAB's Centre for Qualitative Studies, sent in a story about an interesting initiative he's leading called ""FactWatch"". FactWatch is the only university-based fact-checking centre in Bangladesh, it has been doing well, and it's been listed with Meta as well. It's run by our students, and this initiative was shortlisted by THE for contribution to the regional development category.

ULAB is now offering a minor in South Asian Studies. What will be included in the curriculum? How will that impact in shaping the world views of students?

Professor Imran Rahman: South Asian studies is a subset of international relations, which is an important subject in a globalised world. While we don't have a department of international relations, the beauty of a liberal arts system is that even though we don't have a degree program, we will find a way to teach one or two core topics. The reason we are offering this minor is because we have a brilliant director behind this, Sudeep Chakravarti. He is an internationally famed nonfiction writer who has written books on South Asia. The courses under this minor will be available to students across all departments and disciplines. This will give students an additional skillset that might provide an edge for certain jobs.

ULAB's Department of Bangla Language and Literature has formulated a ""creative thinking-based professional curriculum"". Can you tell us more about it?

Professor Imran Rahman: National Professor Rafiqul Islam, who had been with ULAB since the beginning, pushed to start a Bangla department at this university. At first, there was a bit of apprehension. But in a country with 170 million Bangla speakers where the language is a central part of our history, it seemed like the right decision to have a Bangla department. Other private universities offer degrees in Bangla, but we felt that we need to offer it just like we offer it in English. Those who study English won't spend their entire lives writing. They study English for their love of it, they study it to develop their thinking and their writing skills. English students are versatile, and they have to think a lot and write a lot and they are skilled in critical thinking. Similarly, we thought we could have a Bangla department where they can pick up skills they will need for their working lives. The learning takes place in a way where the students are involved in the teaching process, we call it ""Active Learning"". Fifty percent of the assessment will be done through written exams, and the other fifty percent will be through interaction. This encapsulates the creative thinking part.

The professional curriculum refers to the non-credit ""Essential Skills"" course that every undergraduate student has to take. They have to attend these courses that include behaviour, etiquette, online conduct, empathy, tolerance, etc. And on top of that, they also have to learn English.

Dhaka is a difficult place to live, especially for young students. What does ULAB do to make lives easier for its students in this regard?

Professor Imran Rahman: Many students at ULAB come from outside Dhaka, and I'm proud of the effort they're making to get an education. They leave their families to live by themselves, do their chores, travel alone, and have to deal with loneliness. We try to keep an eye on them from the first term because students based in Dhaka have the luxury to fall back on their families for support.

We are starting a separate program for students from outside Dhaka so they can adjust to life in Dhaka quickly. We will focus on assisting them with accommodation, transportation, and help in general.

The University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked private universities to shift to a two-semester system from 2023. How do you view this proposed change?

Professor Imran Rahman: Most private universities in Bangladesh have been using the trimester system without any hassle. There is a proverb in English: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". We believe that this decision should be left to the universities. In Bangladesh, we don't have anything close to the diversity of systems that a place like the USA has. They have semesters, trimesters, and even quarter systems. The universities get to decide what works for them. I hope UGC comes around and lets universities make this decision for themselves.

Late last year, there was a push to start wings of national-level student politics bodies in private universities. Is the university ready to face the complications that come with the presence of politics on campus?

Professor Imran Rahman: Most private universities, from day one, did not want wings of political parties on their campuses, because our history with them has been poor. There was a time when those who participated in student politics were the brightest students. That is no longer the case. Our alumni, teachers, students, and their parents, – everyone agrees that this is not a good idea. This does not mean our students won't be politically aware. They will be future voters and have views. Good students and strong individuals should get into politics themselves. But we don't think wings of political parties in private universities will add anything.

Private universities are increasingly going toe to toe with public universities. Do you think this is part of a bigger trend in Bangladesh's education sector? And is that good for the country as a whole?

Professor Imran Rahman: I do think this is part of a trend in the education sector. I base my answer on my 22 years of experience working with a public university (Institution of Business Administration, Dhaka University) and then 16 years working with a private university. In my view, most of the development achieved in the higher education sector has been led by private universities. This is because of the lack of freedom that public universities often have to operate under.

Overall, yes, I do believe the education sector is moving in the right direction but we have a lot of work left to do. Students enter university after 12-13 years of schooling but often lack basic skills, so the quality of education has to be looked at.

The challenge now is to increase the quality of our education, making sure graduates have the right kind of skills to achieve whatever it is they want to do and to make sure they have international parity, where they can compete with students from any country in the world.

What does ULAB do to be more inclusive for students of all economic and social strata?

Professor Imran Rahman: We provide assistance to students to the extent that we can. Our only source of funds is tuition fees so we are limited by that, but we want to assist students. The government should also think about helping our students with scholarships. During the pandemic, we provided financial assistance and we had a committee to look at cases individually. Moving forward, we will do as much as we can as well. We can waive some small fees, extend deadlines, waive late fees, and we can do more for meritorious students.

11,"Legal actions for bullying, ragging in educational institutions","Legal action will be taken against student, teacher, or staff of any educational institution if they are found to be involved directly or indirectly in bullying or ragging.

In this regard, the government has formulated a new policy titled ""Educational Institution Bullying or Ragging Prevention Policy 2023"", according to an education ministry notification.

Action will be taken as per existing criminal law under the policy which will be applicable to all educational institutions across the country, it said.

If the president or members of the managing committee or governing body of the institution are involved in ragging, action will be taken in the same way, it added.

Each institution has been asked to immediately form a bullying and ragging prevention committee consisting of three to five members to this end.

The ministry asked the educational institutions to organise anti-ragging campaigns and to make and publish films, cartoons, banners, festoons, and online posters featuring the consequences of ragging and bullying.

Besides, educational institutions have been asked not to organise any kind of programme or conduct any kind of task that fuels bullying or ragging, and to set up CCTV cameras in the places where ragging or bullying are likely to occur.",2023-05-03 15:56:16,https://www.thedailystar.net/youth/education/news/legal-actions-bullying-ragging-educational-institutions-3310321,2023-05-18 10:18:25,thedailystar
12,It’s against academicians’ freedom,"Says University Teachers' Network on steps taken against Prof Imtiaz Ahmed, another academician

University Teachers' Network today condemned steps by the Dhaka University authority against two teachers, including Prof Imtiaz Ahmed of international relations department, saying that the decisions violate the academic freedom of an academician.

""Dhaka University is traditionally a liberal institution. But some recent activities of the authorities and some administrators prove that they have taken the responsibility to kill the heritage and commitment of the university,"" reads a statement of the network, signed by 51 teachers of different public and private universities.

The decisions are also contradictory with the university ordinance, they said.

The DU syndicate, the highest decision maker body of the university, on April 30 relieved Prof Imtiaz Ahmed from all academic activities of DU for allegedly distorting the country's history and defaming Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

Also, in the meeting of DU syndicate, the issue of a Facebook post of ASM Amanullah, professor of sociology department and a pro-BNP teacher leader, was raised. Later, ASM Amanullah was granted pardon on the condition of signing a bond.

The teachers' platform said, ""We think history has one narrative, but other narratives exist in parallel. But reading and analysing major historical events from different perspectives is a part of academic practice and freedom.""

""If Professor Imtiaz has given wrong information, then an information-enriched historical article could be the answer. Historical truths are established through theses and counter-theses,"" added the statement.

The platform opined taking disciplinary action against anyone cannot be the task of the executive council of an academic institution.

Punishing colleagues by taking the side of the ruling class is not the responsibility of a university, rather protecting the academic freedom of teachers and students is their responsibility, the statement read.",2023-05-03 16:20:18,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/education/news/its-against-academicians-freedom-3310326,2023-05-18 10:18:26,thedailystar
13,Do they ever teach us how to learn?,"Picture this. You have your exams coming up. Your syllabus is printed and your books are on the table. You sit down to study and that's when it hits you. You're not exactly sure what it is that you're supposed to do.

When we are trying to learn a new topic, the first step is to read through the content. To try and understand the material in front of us and to process it. But what comes after that?

After the initial step of reading through and understanding the source material comes the step of actually learning the material – applying the knowledge that we have learned as necessary. As children, the significance of how we learn is understated and in most cases, completely overlooked. We are urged to study not to learn but to simply achieve good grades at an early age. We are, however, never taught how to study.

This revelation came to me as I was ""studying"" for my exams.

I had been jotting down notes for a course of mine when it occurred to me that all I was doing was writing the same information that was in the book back in my notebook. I sat there for some time, debating whether or not there were any benefits to what I was doing. After some intense deliberation, I came to the conclusion that what I was doing only served as mental satisfaction as I could tell myself afterwards that I had spent time studying, but it did not really help me remember the information any better. Sure I could read the notes again before my exams, but would it be so much better than taking some more time to read through the book again? Not really.

When we are younger, this isn't such a big problem. The syllabus isn't too big and the information isn't too complex. With enough concentration, it is possible to learn the information well.

However, as we grow up, the material becomes more vast and the information gets more complex. Simply reading the content thoroughly does not suffice anymore. So why do we face this problem?

As children, we are expected to know the most efficient way to study, even though this is a very complicated problem to solve. Moreover, it is an issue that varies from person to person. There is no universally correct way to study. What works for some may not work for others. More attention should be given by caretakers at early ages to help children figure out what works for them. I am eighteen years of age and I still don't know what the best way to study is for me.

Every exam season, I try different methods of studying. Whether that be making my own notes for the subject, watching mind-numbing lectures on the topic or simply solving question papers. And most of my peers face the same problem. Figuring out the best way for us to study takes up a huge part of our lives.

Trying to solve this problem at a younger age, instead of letting children feel isolated when they don't know how to study, can eliminate a huge portion of suffering later on in their lives.

14,Helpful initiative falling apart,"DU’s sanitary pad vending machines malfunctioning, causing trouble for students

Dhaka University's attempt to break period-related stigmas and provide easier access to menstrual-hygiene products has hit a snag. Despite the installation of sanitary pad vending machines throughout the campus, many female students are left without the intended benefits due to the machines malfunctioning.

Students who have struggled to access the products despite paying money, and are now calling for urgent solutions.

The initiative was taken three years ago by Dhaka University Central Students' Union (Ducsu) in partnership with ACI Group to break the taboo surrounding menstruation hygiene.

The vending machines were supposed to provide easier access to the products and lower costs for almost 12,000 female students.

Along with Ruqayyah Hall, Shamsun Nahar Hall, Bangladesh-Kuwait Maitree Hall, Bangamata Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib Hall and Kabi Sufia Kamal Hall -- the machines have also been installed at Teacher-Student Centre (TSC), girls' common rooms at arts, business studies, fine arts faculties, and the science faculty library.

Female students said the malfunctioning machines have caused more inconvenience than comfort. The machines often offer low-quality napkins and do not provide pads even after payment.

Nineteen-year-old Sharifa Oishee had a similar experience when the vending machine took her money but provided no product. She tried again but faced the same situation. ""Every time I use these machines, they fail. I've lost the money every time as well, so I stopped using them,"" said the second-year student of English.

This correspondent polled 42 DU students, who expressed similar problems, including money waste, technical faults, excessive waiting times, and low-quality napkins.

Munira, a residential student at Ruqayyah Hall, said they had to rely on vending machines in the event of an emergency late at night because most stores remain closed at that time, but they run into unwanted problems because the machines barely work.

A few students from the same hall remarked that the facility varies in usefulness depending on the old and new buildings and dormitories; for example, the newly completed 7th March building has a fully functional machine.

Besides, each machine is meant to have two towels and two trash cans. The students were assured that they would always receive support from a female aide while purchasing a pad. Unfortunately, none of these services have been made available yet.

Female students are demanding continuous supervision of the process to make it more efficient. They also recommend the installation of a digital money-transfer system in case of emergencies.

Hasin Jahan, country director of WaterAid Bangladesh said, ""Students spend a lot of time in their classrooms, which demands adequate supply of sanitary pads inside academic institutions. Besides, female wash-rooms of educational institutions are often unhygienic. This issue requires immediate attention.""

Tilottoma Shikder, a member of the DU senate, suggested the need for campaigns to teach the students about the usage of the machines and speaking out when faced with problems.

""If a student complains about any malfunction, the service providers will give her an extra sanitary pad without any question,"" she claimed.

However, all is not bad. Each pad costs Tk 10 from the DU machines, which is less than what is charged at pharmacies. The machines are re-filled in time by ACI group every week.

Prof Tania Haque of women and gender studies said the initiative to install sanitary pads will advance the concept of healthy sanitation for women.

She urged the university authority to take central steps to install sanitary pad vending machines not only for students but also for female staff and faculty members.",2023-04-20 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/youth/education/campus/news/helpful-initiative-falling-apart-3302311,2023-05-18 10:18:29,thedailystar
15,"NCTB corrects over 400 errors in class 6, 7 textbooks","The National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) issued a series of corrections for over 400 errors in the textbooks of classes six and seven this academic year.

NCTB issued the subject-wise corrections in separate notifications on their official website on Friday.

These corrections will be sent to school heads, through the respective authorities, Prof Moshiuzzaman, member (Curriculum) of NCTB, told The Daily Star.

He said, ""The committee reviewed all the 48 books (English and Bangla Version) of these two classes, to find out errors before issuing corrections.""

Analysing the notifications, it was found that around 202 corrections were for class six textbooks while 226 corrections were made for class seven for Bangla version. Besides, some 56 corrections were issued in various books for the English version in these two classes.

It was found that, History and Social Science practice books of both the classes carried the most number of errors, while Bangla contained least number of errors.

When asked, how it can be helpful for teachers or students, as the corrections were being issued after four months, Prof Moshiuzzaman said ""These are not any major errors or mistakes, which can hamper students' learning.""

""At first, we planned to review only three books. But we went on reviewing all the books to find out all errors, which can help us in publishing better textbooks in future,"" he said.

He said teachers have to play the key role to implement these corrections at their schools. They will inform their students about the corrections when they go on taking classes on that specific topic or subject.",2023-05-01 07:11:13,https://www.thedailystar.net/youth/education/news/nctb-corrects-over-400-errors-class-6-7-textbooks-3308746,2023-05-18 10:18:30,thedailystar
16,How ChatGPT’s growth may be affecting young copywriters,"Large language model (LLM) driven AI such as ChatGPT and Google Bard are very sophisticated artificial intelligence systems that use previously existing data to process human input and provide relevant output. As a result, the AI is also capable of providing human-like text based on simple prompts, a feat that has many content writers terrified for their career prospects. The younger writers who are merely stepping into the field may end up being the most affected since their lack of experience will now seemingly pit them directly against the likes of an AI as a competitor in an already saturated market.

AI that automatically produces large bodies of text has already existed in one shape or another. But with the advent of ChatGPT and everything else that follows, it is evident that we are faced with a form of AI that is far more efficient and capable than ever before. As such, many businesses have already attempted to use ChatGPT to generate articles that are mainly focused on providing content and not being opinion pieces. This has, rather unsurprisingly, shaken the content-writing community.

However, according to writers, AI still has ways to go before it manages to cause a significant dent in the copywriting industry.

""If someone wants basic content, they can just use AI, but most clients usually demand a specific tone in their work."" says Faiza Ramim, a student at the Institute of Business Administration, Dhaka University, and currently working as a content writer at PolyUno, ""You have to use your common sense for a lot of it, something AI still can't do.""

She adds, ""When you join a firm, they always give you feedback and training and are critical of your work, which helps you improve. ChatGPT, after a certain point, keeps going in circles for a particular answer. However, if you're a freelance writer, you may struggle to find work since clients are now extremely picky.""

The problem, then, is in how clients have been reacting to this development. Local businesses that are selling products usually tend to put very little effort into writing sales copies and other content, and thus, they almost always hire young writers at very low pay. These writers are typically fresh blood, seeking out whatever experience they can find before landing a position at a company. The rise of ChatGPT, however, might end up removing avenues of work for them.

""Businesses and owners who think copywriting and content writing are things everyone can do will go with ChatGPT because it seems to do the basics of those tasks adequately. But it will create a glut of very samey sounding copies and content that will blur together,"" says Muhtasim Sarowat Rayed, founder of UpThrust, a popular content blog.

And that is yet another situation that exists simply due to ChatGPT. Before anything, it is important to remember that, as an AI system, its capabilities are still very much limited. Its intelligence is still far away from being comparable to a human brain and it most certainly isn't capable of creating inciting copies that are catered to advertise to specific audiences.

""At the end of the day, clients look for creative people who can bring something unique to the table. Some small businesses use ChatGPT, yes, but you'll see that they are not putting a lot of effort into their social media content, so the business ends up not growing anyway,"" says Ali Fiaz* who has a background in professional copywriting.

What does this mean? Well, if anything, this will eventually lead to a problem small-scale businesses will face when they realise that their businesses cannot grow due to how closely their social media content resembles that of their competition – other small-scale businesses relying on ChatGPT to grow their audience. For any business to grow, its textual content has to be rich and full of personality. Human writers, fresh or veteran, will not run out of demand as long as they can provide unique insight into what they are writing.

Take the Twitter account for Wendy's as an example, the very identifiable sarcastic voice provided by a human being in everything it posts cannot be replicated by AI at any level just yet. Several other social media outlets for brands across the world attempt to stand out in similar ways, and when a company decides to rely solely on AI for their social media content, they inevitably fall behind in terms of audience engagement.

All that being said, it is important to recognise that the situation is not necessarily just a ""humans vs. AI"" battle. Tools such as ChatGPT and many other experimental copywriting software are useful when it comes to planning and researching specific ideas for creating content. Many writers make frequent use of AI's ability to organise ideas in a cohesive manner which they then incorporate into their content. The boom of AI may inevitably lead to a new era for writers where they work with the tools instead of competing against them.

""I've worked with several AI tools and can tell you that it certainly helps me out while dealing with burnouts or working with brands that I don't quite click with. AI still is not capable of grasping certain nuances of language, so they'd only really be replacing me if the work involves generic kinds of captions and such,"" adds Nusaibah F. Yunus, a student of North South University and a part-time copywriter.

This is an opinion that's shared by many. As time passes, the fear of being replaced by an AI may eventually get replaced by the wisdom that AI can open doors for many writers both young and old.

Emerging writers should pay close attention to learning how they may make use of AI as tools in their writing. Even if the industry changes drastically, human input will always be valued for its uniqueness and creative outlook. However, even that requires certain levels of adaptability with time. In the coming years, writers may not get replaced, but they may struggle if they do not adapt to AI.

17,The case for studying law,"The word ""lawyer"" might invoke certain scenes and images in our minds. The dramatic usage of legal jargon inside a tense courtroom, or the overworked paralegal drowning in mountains of paper may come to mind. Some cultures might revere legal professions, others might have a not-so-favourable view.

Regardless of all the preconceived notions, making a career in the legal sector is a long and arduous journey and at the end of it all lies the struggle to uphold justice.

The reasons for choosing a career in law differs from person to person. Ali Mashraf, Lecturer of Law at East West University, shares, ""My mother being a law professor was indeed a consideration. However, she never pressured me to study law. Instead I wanted to study journalism at Dhaka University (DU). But I didn't get the subject due to a controversial admission test rule. So then, I applied to study law at DU.""

Anupoma Joyeeta Joyee, who is a Barrister-at-Law of Lincoln's Inn, and Advocate, District and Sessions Judge Court, adds, ""Back in school, I used to really love debating. Towards the end of high school, all my peers started getting enrolled into medicine or engineering admission coaching centres. I realised I needed to make a decision quickly so I sat my family down and sought their opinion. It was a consensus across the board that since I had good oratory skills, I would probably enjoy the field of law.""

The first step in pursuing a career in law consists of obtaining a Bangladeshi law degree from a reputed college or university. The Bachelor of Laws (LLB) programme is the standard 3-year-long undergraduate law degree, whereas an LLB Honours (Hons) degree is considered to be of a higher level, consisting of specialisation and taking about four years to complete. Law colleges offer Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Law, which takes two years and costs significantly less than an LLB degree from a private institution.

Students can either choose a private or public institution for their LLB or LLB (Hons) degree. Private institutions such as North South University and BRAC University centre their curriculum around Bangladeshi law, the same as public universities. On the other hand, only a few institutions such as London College of Legal Studies (LCLS) and Newcastle Law Academy (NLA) focus on British law.

Chandra Banarjee completed her LLB degree from LCLS (South) under University of London's program and is now pursuing her Master of Laws (LLM) degree from Bangladesh University of Professionals. On the topic of her LLB degree, she shares, ""One of the pros of a private institution is that you get more attention from the faculty members and your academic problems are dealt with instantly. You can also get more support from other students as everyone is studying law.""

As for the drawbacks of a private institution, Chandra adds, ""Studying through an institution like LCLS is cheaper than going to the UK. However, the cost is still huge. People who are from well-off families are lucky in this case, but this is not the case for everyone.""

Public universities such as Dhaka University and Jahangirnagar University all consist of highly competitive LLB programs.

Tauhid Rahman*, an LLB student from Dhaka University, shares his experience, ""The access to world class teachers and their thoughts is extremely important. Rather than just asking to memorise entire case laws and statutes, our teachers also ask us about the loopholes and the problems with these laws. I think this mindset is vital.""

Public universities are not without systemic fault, however, as Tauhid adds, ""One of the cons would be lack of sheer will from the teacher's side. Frequent cancellations, late arrivals continue to be a problem. Law clinics, which are vital for any law student, are non-existent in most of the public institutions.""

Upon completion of the LLB program, the graduates have several paths to choose from. The first and most obvious option would be to become an advocate or barrister, and this is where the Bar Exam comes in.

In order to become an advocate in Bangladesh, a six-month long pupillage must be completed under a senior lawyer or law firm. After that, the graduates need to pass the Bar Exam administered by the Bangladesh Bar Council to become eligible to practice law. Once the graduate passes the Bar Exam, they must register with the Bar Council to obtain the licence and officially become an advocate in the lower court. For the higher court, the candidates need to give the High Court Permission Exam and a recommendation is required to become enrolled in the Appellate Division.

If a student chooses to enrol into the Bar Training Course (BTC) and become a barrister, they first need to meet the requirements for an English law degree under a university in England or Wales, which is possible studying at institutions such as LCLS and NLA. Then, they need to complete the BTC, which can take up to a year or two. After that, prospective barristers then undertake a year-long pupillage in barristers' chambers or in an organisation approved by the Bar Standards Board. Once the training is complete, the final step would be to secure tenancy in a set of barristers' chambers or go into practice as an employed barrister.

If a candidate chooses to come back to Bangladesh and become an advocate, they will still have to sit for the Bangladesh Bar Exam. This is where both sides face a common issue, as the Bar Exam in Bangladesh is held infrequently, whereas it's supposed to be held twice every year. However, since 2017, the Bar Council has only conducted three enrolment exams.

Regarding her experience, Barrister-at-Law Joyee says, ""Despite clearing all the stages in one go, it took around 2 years before I could obtain the licence. Throughout that entire period, with the constant anxiety and frustration, I was working full time, not knowing when I finally would be able to formally qualify as an Advocate. On top of that, a lot of seniors use the requirement to have a licence to severely underpay the juniors.""

It is a common assumption that becoming a barrister is necessary to practise in Bangladesh, or that the foreign bar exam makes for a better lawyer. Joyee says, ""The pros of being called to the bar of England and Wales are largely passive. However, over time, it can culminate into a really valuable investment into a lawyer's career in Bangladesh. The training itself is really intense, so aside from the decorative value that we attach with becoming a Barrister due to our colonial hangover, the learning is also quite constructive.""

Barrister Shahedul Azam, Advocate at the Supreme Court of Bangladesh and Partner at Credence LP, echoes this sentiment, saying, ""Clients usually value the title of 'Barrister' but on a professional level, advocates perform just as well, sometimes even better. In my personal view, becoming a Barrister sharpens some skills for the individuals.""

Another point of concern for law aspirants is that the returns on investment usually come in the latter stages of the career. It is not uncommon for junior lawyers to be paid around BDT 5,000-10,000 during their pupillage.

Farzana Tasreen Synthia, Barrister-at-Law, Lincoln's Inn and Senior Associate at Credence LP, says, ""Say you invest a handsome amount of money to make a career in law. Then, if you decide to practice in Bangladesh, you cannot really expect a return on investment within 1 year or 5 years. If you're expecting that, then you're in the wrong profession.""

The late monetary returns, combined with the hassle of waiting for the Bangladesh Bar Exam, often influences LLB graduates to turn to other career pathways.

One such example is Ali Mashraf, who says, ""If the exams were held regularly, I may have decided to pursue a dual career. Since junior lawyers who work as apprentices in chambers experience various roadblocks like meagre pay, I realised that I did not want to experience this steep journey at the onset of my career. Hence, I decided to pursue a career in academia.""

Another common pathway is to work as an in-house legal counsel at a corporate firm, where the practices greatly vary from a litigation firm.

Barrister-at-Law Farzana Tasreen Synthia, speaks of her experience in both sectors, ""In-house counsels blend with other departments and use their legal analytical skills with the current problems to provide assistance. Whereas in law chambers, particular issues are brought to you by clients for legal advice.""

Perhaps one of the grander goals of pursuing law would be to be appointed as a judge in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. A minimum of 10 years of practice in the High Court division, coupled with recommendations, elevates the High Court advocate to Justice.

Apart from these requirements, justice aspirants have to undergo a more extensive and rigorous academic career, viva voces, and extremely thorough background screenings to make the cut.

Tauhid, who had once aspired to be a judge, shares, ""In order to become a judge, a relatively greater amount of study than the Bar is required. Hence, most students opt for the bar.""

As for the future of practising law, Barrister Shahedul Azam says, ""Given the current political climate, there may not be much improvement in law as a subject. Furthermore, given the payment structure and the nearly-guaranteed struggle of about 5-10 years, a lot of talented people change career paths.""

But there may be hope for young advocates, as he adds, ""In the past, with due respect to senior lawyers, the structure was a one-man show. When I returned to Bangladesh as a barrister, I worked in a top firm but I was paid nearly nothing. That was the norm but we are trying to change the system. We have introduced a basic starting salary and in time will try to introduce work participation fees to sustain their livelihoods.""

19,Equipping Bangladeshi Youth for the Global Job Market,"Dignitaries on the stage during the signing ceremony and discussion session at the '21st Century Skills for the Global Job Market'.

AYAT Education, in partnership with Seneca College, recently organised a discussion on '21st Century Skills for the Global Market' at Pan Pacific Sonargaon, Dhaka.

Bangladesh has made tremendous economic growth over the last 50 years, but needs to resolve the youth unemployment and skills gap and reap the benefits of demographic dividend for sustaining its development.

A survey conducted by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) in 2021 reports that 66% of the students who graduated from colleges affiliated with the National University are unemployed. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) said 2 million people are being added to the labor force of the country every year but there is no creation of employment in that proportion.

To address these pressing issues, AYAT Education signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Seneca College that will enable knowledge-sharing and academic research opportunities to identify and bridge the youth skills gap and create avenues for specialized learning for future jobs.

The MoU signing was followed by an interactive panel discussion on '21st Century Skills for the Global Market'. Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury, Deputy Minister of Education, David Agnew, President of Seneca College, Angela Dark, Counselor and Senior Trade Commissioner of High Commission of Canada and Tahsin Aman, Chairman of AYAT Education took part in the panel discussion in presence of 150 youth and faculties from different institutions.",2023-03-19 07:26:39,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/equipping-bangladeshi-youth-the-global-job-market-3275106,2023-05-18 10:18:36,thedailystar
20,Unmasking imposter syndrome: A working woman’s guide to breaking free,"Like any other deeply ingrained patterns of overthinking, imposter syndrome too can be very challenging to overcome. But here are a few steps to help manage it. Illustration: Zarif Faiaz.

Imposter syndrome is a psychological phenomenon arising from the unshakeable feeling of inadequacy, where individuals doubt their abilities and achievements, despite evidence of competence, capabilities and experiences. Sufferers tend to internalise and credit their success to being in the right place at the right time. It is a very common experience for people at all levels in the workplace and can be especially debilitating for women new in their careers. In this article, I will delve into the causes of imposter syndrome and sketch out a few possible strategies that may help women tackle it.

Let's start from the very beginning. In most households, young girls and boys are raised quite differently. Boys get validation for the simplest things like making a meal or tidying their own rooms, while for girls it is expected that they will naturally do these. These make boys grow up to be more confident with the tiniest feats and girls grow up with self-doubt with the tiniest failures.

All these lead women to constantly hold themselves against impossible standards, increasing the pressure society inflicts on them and decreasing the leeway for any error. Under such scrutiny, when they do end up achieving amazing things, the feeling that they won't be able to live up to expectations kicks in. In every key moment or milestone such as a promotion, a new role or a new career, women tend to experience imposter syndrome. Men can find so many other successful male role models, that they very seldom question their competence.

Like any other deeply ingrained patterns of overthinking, imposter syndrome too can be very challenging to overcome. But here are a few steps to help manage it:

Recognise how common it is

The first step is to acknowledge its ubiquitous presence; most people experience it at least at some point in their lives. It's comforting to know that even the most accomplished and powerful people in the world have experienced self-doubt.

Talk to other women

Talk to your close friends and trusted colleagues about your common triggers and the situations where you feel like imposters. You will be surprised to find that someone you deem perfect and aspire to be more like possibly also suffers from this. This will make you realise that you too are probably someone others deem aspirational. Talking to other women will give you a better perspective on strategies that worked for them and encouragement to map out your own.

Seek mentorship

A mentor is an advisor in your career, who has a good understanding of your career goals, strengths and weaknesses and uses their own experience to provide guidance. A seasoned mentor can equip you with robust tools that will help you outrun negative self-talk. Ask for constructive criticism and they will help you separate the syndrome from actual areas of improvement you should focus on.

Own your accomplishments

It's very easy to dwell on failures and shortcomings. Whenever you sense that you're about to have a bout of self-doubt, write down 5 things you have done in the past that you're very proud of. Remind yourself how good you are at what you do. Celebrate your successes, big or small. Own your accomplishments, no matter what you hear others saying in the grapevine. Practice self-empathy. Be understanding of yourself whenever you make a mistake like you would for others.

Channel self-doubt into positive motivation

This is easier said than done and should be the last step in your journey to managing imposter syndrome. Once you have been able to bring down your self-doubt to healthy levels, use it as a push to make incremental improvements in your skill sets. But don't let it consume you. Instead of focusing on what you can't do, work out what you can do. Set realistic goals, embrace failures, and embark on your journey of personal growth.

Finally, to conclude, it's important to remember that while it is commendable for women to take charge of building their confidence, the onus doesn't lie on them alone. Corporate leaders must contribute to creating an inclusive culture for women that addresses systematic biases and fosters an environment where feedback isn't synonymous with negative feedback only, but also includes positive affirmations and appreciations. Leaders have a huge role to play in making women feel valued enough to manage, if not overcome their imposter syndrome.",2023-03-17 03:30:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/unmasking-imposter-syndrome-working-womans-guide-breaking-free-3273346,2023-05-18 10:18:37,thedailystar
21,Career options if you have basic computer skills,"""Proficient at using Microsoft Office."" Being able to add just this one line to your CV can open up a host of career options for you. With this one requirement in common, said options do need a couple of additional skills specific to each, such as communication and organisation skills. But having the essential tech down makes it very likely for you to easily find a match.

Here are a few career options if you have basic computing skills.

Customer service representative

Customer service representatives work for businesses that require customer engagement, including retail stores, banks, and insurance companies. Therefore, if you meet the requirements, you are likely to be able to choose which industry, and what kind of environment you want to work in.

Customer service representatives work directly with customers to provide assistance, resolve complaints, answer questions, and process orders. For this, you will need typing and data entry skills, as well as familiarity with programs like MS Word and Excel. Good communication skills are absolutely necessary, as you will have to interact with customers with a positive attitude and empathy to resolve their problems.

Data entry clerk

A data entry clerk is a professional responsible for transferring paper formats into computer files or database systems. Like customer service, this position is available in a wide range of fields.

They handle typing in customer information provided directly into an electronic format, creating spreadsheets with large numbers of figures, verifying data by comparing it to source documents, updating existing data, etc. This requires fast typing and a good grasp of word processing tools like MS Word and Excel. Additionally, this job requires the ability to concentrate and be precise.

Travel agent

There's quite a lot of demand for travel agency services in Bangladesh. Your success as a travel agent depends on your record of being able to find out the best deals for your customers. It's a pretty interesting and rewarding job, with a variety in the kind of information you are dealing with.

This job requires good browsing and navigation skills, and knowledge of computer reservations systems, global distribution systems (GDS), and e-travelling. You will also need to communicate with customers and help them find transport and accommodation suited to their needs, and communicate with hotels, airlines, etc to make reservations and payments. Therefore, multilingualism, most commonly proficiency in Bangla and English, is a big advantage.

Cashier

A cashier is a retail professional who scans items to ensure prices and quantities are correct, assists those who need help or advice on products, and handles returns and exchanges when necessary.

To be a cashier you simply need to know how to use a PC, and have the will to learn how to handle electronic equipment such as cash registers and card readers. You might also need to know some basic math and the use of a calculator. Small talk and smiling at customers might also be asked of you.

These are by no means the only options available to you when you have basic computer skills, but they are a few of the most commonly available ones. The range and scope of career options are quite large if you look out for them and are smart with how you present and market yourself.",2022-12-01 15:27:02,https://www.thedailystar.net/shout/news/career-options-if-you-have-basic-computer-skills-3184836,2023-05-18 10:18:38,thedailystar
22,Career options if you are good at writing,"Growing up, were you that one kid who had an affinity for words? Perhaps the first time you put pen to paper or finger to keyboard, you realised that this was your calling.

Writing is a skill you can put to good use. Irrespective of whether you are writing in English or Bangla, your skills have value, and you can use them to generate some income if you so choose.

This article is for anyone who wants to make writing their profession. So, with that in mind, here are four career opportunities that you can go for if you're good at writing.

Copywriter

I am sure you've seen thousands of job posts on Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram looking for copywriters. Copywriters are always in demand, and copywriting is a great way to start your writing career at an entry level.

The main task involves writing interesting and persuasive text for marketing products, websites, social media pages, etc. If you have ever come across a product description that made you want to impulse buy a product, a copywriter is doing their job right.

If you're looking to get into copywriting, consider reading up on the topic or doing a few online courses before you dive into it. Also, go through social media pages of brands whose content appeals to you. You can take inspiration from their posts, or get an idea about what type of content gets more engagement.

Content Writing

Writing content is a whole other ballgame. Not in the sense that it is difficult, but because it requires a very different set of skills.

While copywriting requires you to be concise and measured, content writing lets you break the walls down and explore writing in a longer format.

With a longer format, comes the challenge of keeping your readers hooked from start to finish. That is a hard skill to learn. Add to that the fact that you never know what you will have to write about. It can be a boring commercial piece or a feature on something you are passionate about. The topics will vary greatly, and you will seldom have the option to choose what you want to write about.

Social Media Manager

Companies need someone to handle their social media accounts, and a good writer is necessary for that.

You will primarily be writing content for social media, whether in bite-sized format or slightly longer content format. The content in question is somewhat a hybrid of what copywriting and content writing requires. It needs to be interesting and engaging, while also not being too long.

An important skill you will need to learn for this particular job is what type of audience you are catering to. While copywriters and content writers also sometimes need to understand their target groups, social media managers have to focus on which demography they need to cater their content towards, both for engagement and conversion purposes.

Communications

While the three previous jobs might have had very specific tasks involved, communications is more of an all-encompassing role. It varies from organisation to organisation and generally involves doing a bit of everything.

Your job as a communications person is to handle all communications of your organisation/project/team either internally or externally (sometimes even both if you are short-staffed). That includes everything from handling reports to writing PR. Being a communications personnel can be quite a challenge, as it requires you to be aware of the many technical details of your organisation, even if you're not working with them directly.

These are just four of the many jobs you can get if you are somewhat skilled at writing. More writing jobs are out there, alongside other jobs and roles where being a good writer can give you a slight edge.

23,Impact of workplace bullying on young professionals,"""We are more than just colleagues. We're a family.""

That's what many employers tell their employees initially when they join the workforce and then go on to either bully them themselves or silently observe from the side-lines as these employees are constantly bullied by their peers.

Workplace bullying is not a new concept. However, over the years, it has been normalised to an extent where people have become oblivious to its prevalence.

The 2021 US Workplace Bullying Survey by the World Bullying Institute (WBI) shows that over 76 million American workers were affected by workplace bullying in 2020. Approximately 43 percent of remote workers were bullied as well.

If anything, this report exposes just how normalised workplace bullying has become. It has reached a point where employees no longer need to be present physically alongside their peers to get bullied.

Comic: Junaid Iqbal Ishmam

As is the case with most bullying incidents, there are three key participants in these situations – victims, perpetrators, and onlookers. While the perpetrators play the leading role in a typical bullying incident, onlookers who don't bother standing up for the victims play the role of normalising these actions.

Like the USA and other parts of the world, Bangladesh too sees its fair share of workplace bullying every year. Unfortunately, unlike the USA, there's no organisation like the WBI here that stays on top of workplace bullying incidents. Because of that, it's difficult to paint a complete picture of just how awful the situation is in our country.

Of course, that doesn't mean that workplace bullying in Bangladesh doesn't exist or is not as prevalent. From what we've learned by talking to some victims of workplace bullying, the situation in our country is just as dreadful as it is in the West, if not worse.

As we dive into the accounts provided by these victims, we'd like our readers to know that none of the individuals we talked to were eager to share their true identities. This paper will respect their requests and maintain anonymity when presenting their experiences.

Bullying at the workplace can take shape in many forms. One of the most common ways this type of bullying starts is when employers ask for too much from their employees and pressure them for it.

Akib*, a freelance graphic designer, explains this scenario from his own experience of working at a digital marketing agency.

""At my previous workplace, my superior would always burden me with more work than I could handle,"" Akib recalled. ""There were days when I had to leave the office at 10 because of the added workload. I protested, but that fell on deaf ears. As a response, I was told how it's all about the hustle these days and if I couldn't handle it, I wasn't cut out for the job.""

""I honestly didn't mind working more,"" Akib continued. ""But there was no incentive or support. I wasn't paid extra nor was I provided any assistance from my superiors. They kept piling all the work on my plate and if I couldn't complete everything in time, I was shamed publicly and called incompetent.""

Another common form of bullying that many experience at work is based around a person's appearance. Their get-ups and bodies are often weaponised against them. Similar to how nosy relatives sometimes shame you for your height, weight, clothes, or skin colour, you might often find your co-workers and superiors doing the same.

Maybe they really were speaking the truth when they said ""we are a family"".

Samira*, who worked at an educational institute, shared, ""After returning from a short holiday, I met a co-worker in the lunchroom who looked at me, and then remarked that I should lose all the weight I had gained as it would be 'good for me'. This person seemed to be visibly uncomfortable and shocked by the fact that I had gained some weight.""

Someone's appearance should not be something that is talked about in an office. It's ironic that people who preach the ideals of being a consummate ""professional"" in the workplace often find ways to comment on the bodies and appearances of individuals they work with.

Freelance journalist Anika* faced a similar ordeal.

""I was diagnosed with an eating disorder and have been struggling with it for a while now,"" she said. ""This year, I shared my diagnosis with one of my co-workers. However, when he and another male colleague were together, they would gang up on me and comment on what I was eating or make fun of me for not eating anything solid during lunch.""

""They would also gang up on me for my personality,"" Anika added. ""I was an introvert and that seemed to bother them. They would constantly remark that it made sense I had no friends because I was so silent. They would make fun of my social media presence, telling me that I was 'pretending to be depressed' and that my tattoos were stupid.""

Sometimes, people at work begin to act like the high school bullies we often see in TV shows and movies. They bully their co-workers for no particular reason other than the fact that they enjoy doing it.

When asking some of the victims how these instances of bullying affected them, we learned just how much of a psychological impact it can leave on its victims.

""I didn't enter the office lunchroom for almost a year after the incident,"" said Samira. ""Also, right after it happened, I was very conscious while eating in front of people.""

For Anika, it took a heavier toll.

""I began to avoid going to the office because it was too much for me to digest,"" said Anika. ""I felt as if they were right, and that my life was a joke. Quite often, when I did go to work, I would excuse myself from the lunch table, so I could go to the bathroom where I would frequent and break down after they had bullied me.""

Akib straight up quit his job and went freelance.

""I was done with them,"" Akib said. ""The workload itself was pressuring and on top of that, I had to listen to my boss 'educate' me about the hustle culture and how I can't succeed in life without pushing my limits. So, less than a year after I joined, I quit and started working as a freelancer.""

A major reason why workplace bullying still persists in this day and age, is due to the failure of human resources (HR) divisions to address the issue properly. The general perception around HR seems to be that they exist to serve the interest of the company and not the employees.

Dibbo*, who formerly worked in a humanitarian organisation, told us, ""On multiple occasions, I complained to the HR about how my boss was bullying me, to the point of threatening me if I was not putting in extra hours beyond what was in my contact. Not only did HR fail to acknowledge my issue, they told me to 'toughen up', otherwise I would not survive in the Bangladeshi job market.""

Photo: Orchid Chakma

Nazifa*, formerly a development sector employee, shared with us how her HR personnel had actually been the one who began bullying her in the first place.

""Two of my co-workers, who I would drop home, would often engage in discussion over office gossip and drama. Because I did not actively participate in gossiping, they began to bully me,"" she said.

The culture of workplace bullying seems to be an inevitability, almost akin to gravity. And what goes up, must come down. More and more young people, who are just entering the job market, are willing to compromise – at times choosing to take a pay cut – for a better work environment.

It looks very likely that in the future, our increasingly younger workforce will shift out of workplaces where the culture of bullying runs wild. Keeping this in mind, employers should be the first to address the issue. They are the ones who need to set even stricter guidelines on workplace bullying.

Anti-bullying committees in the workplace should not just be filled with senior management. They must seek active participation from younger recruits. If necessary, these committees should have independent external members who preside over bullying, harassment, or any other case that needs to be addressed without any self-interests.

24,IUB alumnus wins NASA grant for next gen space tech battery research,"Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB) alumnus Md. Wahidul Hasan, a PhD candidate and research assistant at the South Dakota Mines, USA, and his team have won the prestigious NASA EPSCoR grant worth USD 750,000 to fund research into the next generation of lithium-sulphur batteries for use in space technology. The grant follows an innovation leading to the use of corn stalk residues to stabilise battery chemistry and nearly double charging capacity of current technology.

Wahid, who obtained BSc degree in 2013 and MSc in 2016 in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from IUB and also taught Computer Science and Engineering at IUB, specialises in solid state lithium sulphur battery and electrochemical energy storage.

The Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) establishes partnerships with government, higher education and industry that are designed to effect lasting improvements in a state or region's research infrastructure, research and development (R&D) capacity and its national R&D competitiveness.

According to a NASA press release issued last month, the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology will look to create a new lithium-sulphur battery technology that is superior to existing lithium-ion batteries. Improving the power capacity and life of batteries could help NASA power rockets, spacecraft, and habitats on the Moon, and eventually, Mars.

""Lithium sulphur battery is a relatively new type of battery that is still in the development and testing phase but it has already shown promise as a next generation energy storage technology. Sulphur is abundant in nature and we got the carbon from Corn stalks, making it a bio product, which means it is going through a renewable process. Therefore, we can definitely say that this battery is a source of renewable energy,"" said Wahid.

""In recent times, the USA is focusing on promoting electric vehicles because they suit climate goals and help protect the environment. This technology, once fully matured, can be used in transportation and thus immensely help in reducing pollution in a developing country like Bangladesh,"" added Wahid.

Apart from pursuing his PhD education and the research on lithium-sulphur battery technology, he aims at doing further research on developing carbon emission free renewable energy and battery storage. Wahid also plans to set up a research facility in Bangladesh for young scientists to develop new technologies.",2023-04-17 11:23:22,https://www.thedailystar.net/shout/news/iub-alumnus-wins-nasa-grant-next-gen-space-tech-battery-research-3299031,2023-05-18 10:18:42,thedailystar

30,Bangladeshi bead artist grabs Guinness World Record,"Anisa Murshed makes the longest thread of beads in one hour.

Anisa Murshed is a Bangladeshi bead artist holding 20 years of experience. She took up the craft as a hobby when she was just ten years old and mastered bead art with years of self-practice.

On August 12, 2022, Anisa broke the Guinness World Record for the ""Longest Thread of Beads Made by an Individual in One Hour"" as part of her initiative to promote bead art as well as her expertise in this field. Official declaration from Guinness was given on November 1 after a series of evidence reviews.

Anisa is currently the only female to still hold an individual Guinness World Record title from Bangladesh.

A marketing specialist by trade, Anisa initiated her passion project ""Hey AniSay"" back in 2021 through which she showcases creatively unique and millennial forms of bead art.

Breaking a Guinness World Record is a goliath task, for it demands numerous steps of preparation, submission, and evidence-proofing over a span of months, sometimes years.

The thread of beads that Anisa created was 42.3 meters long, with 1,671 beads in total. The previous record for the same title was 32.7 meters which Anisa successfully exceeded by almost 10 meters to claim herself to be ""Officially Amazing!""

Less than ten individuals have claimed the Guinness World Titles from Bangladesh.

""The creativity, effort, and time put behind a piece of bead art gets overlooked as bead art is not a very popular form of craft. Particularly in Bangladesh, where handcrafted products do not gain the admiration it deserves. Beading is not just a craft; it is an exercise that helps develop creativity, focus, and patience. Through my initiatives, I want to inspire Bangladeshi crafters to take up bead art, earn from it and eventually take local bead art initiatives to the world."" says Anisa.",2022-11-28 10:51:07,https://www.thedailystar.net/shout/news/bangladeshi-bead-artist-grabs-guinness-world-record-3181786,2023-05-18 10:18:51,thedailystar
31,Climate-smart ideas showcased at Ideabuzz 2022,"Commemorating 50 years of partnership with Bangladesh, the World Bank recently organised ""Ideabuzz Championship"", a youth competition for university students. During the competition, these students were asked to come up with inventive solutions to climate change.

The competition called for entries to answer the question: ""How can Bangladesh achieve climate-smart growth benefiting all?"", and saw an overwhelming response with submissions from 137 teams consisting of 400 students from around 30 universities across Bangladesh. The winning solutions varied from increasing agricultural output to harnessing the Internet of Things (IoT) for climate-smart growth, developing drone structures, and repurposing waste water for irrigation.

The champions, Team CO2 Killers, consisted of Irina Anjum Pranti, Sumaieta Tasnim and Mohammad Ehsanul Haque, from Islamic University of Technology. Their solution focussed on the development of a smart agriculture system in which, after testing and analysing cultivable soil, an app named Agrisheba will notify farmers of soil status and other key factors in order to boost crop yield. It is a smart monitoring system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) that assures the optimal use of agricultural resources such as water, fertilisers, and herbicide to help the soil become more climate resilient. This will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, water wastage, excessive fertiliser use, crop production expenses, while boosting agricultural efficiency.

""In order to make Agrisheba more useful to our farmers, we would be putting up a comprehensive strategy that includes the necessary technical support, government funding, and research facilitation. To combat climate change, Agrisheba can turn conventional agriculture into resilient and sustainable precision farming,"" explained Ehsanul, a member of winning team.

""Farmers who are most vulnerable to climate change, lie at the heart of our solution. Furthermore, we would be educating children and youth in rural areas about climate smart farming in order to create meaningful change,"" he noted.

This winning team is expected to pitch their idea at the World Bank Headquarters in early 2023.

The Samaritans became the first runners up. This team comprised of Rafi Bin Dastagir, Syed Tawsif Islam and Mishfaqur Rahman, from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). The underlying theme of their solution was to create a sustainable form of healthcare facility that provides instantaneous emergency treatment to patients after and even during natural disasters caused by climate change.

""Our idea, Tatkhonik, was to couple medical boats with autonomous drones that could plan the fastest path towards the patients calling for help avoiding obstacles. The drones would be further equipped with our heat signature detection system to identify stranded individuals requiring immediate help,"" Rafi explained.

""We planned to boost the accessibility of healthcare among estranged communities. Through Tatkhonik, our goal is to cut down the time it takes for the rescue team to reach the people in need because during emergencies, a minute can be a difference between life and death,"" Tawsif added.

Finally, Team Go Grey, consisting of Bushra Shakil, Faiyaz Uddin Ayeshik and Justita Musrat from the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), University of Dhaka, ended their journey as the second runners up. Their climate-smart idea involved segregating the water used during ablution in mosques around the country and channelling it for farmland irrigation. Such reuse of water will not only ensure more resources for stakeholders like farmers but also a source of revenue for these mosques who currently solely rely on donations.

""A lot is being done about waste management – starting with segregating different types of waste right where it is created. We decided to replicate the same model to manage, segregate and reuse water,"" Bushra explained.

""In this case, irrigation canals needed to be dug to create a passage for water to flow from the mosques to the farmland with minor changes in the existing pipeline of the mosque,"" Faiyaz said.

The participants described their overall experience to be amazing. ""We got to know a lot more about the tangible implications of climate change throughout the research and development of our solutions. We are happy to have been even a small part of such much needed change,"" Justita concluded.",2022-11-27 14:18:26,https://www.thedailystar.net/shout/news/climate-smart-ideas-showcased-ideabuzz-2022-3181016,2023-05-18 10:18:52,thedailystar

37,Major targets of current budget still unmet,"The government is far away from achieving the major targets set for the current fiscal year when the national budget was unveiled in June last year, owing to its failures to assess the global scenario before fixing the goals, experts said.

The major targets that the government might miss at the end of 2022-23 include gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation, revenue and annual development programme (ADP).

Initially, the government set a 7.5 per cent GDP growth target. Later, the target was revised downwards twice, cutting it to 6.5 per cent owing to the continuing stress in the economy stemming from the dragging fallout of the coronavirus pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war.

The GDP is estimated to have grown by 6.03 per cent in FY23, said the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), which arrived at the figure on the basis of the data of the first half of FY23.

The estimate is, however, higher than the projection made by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank.

The government has also not been able to rein in the rising trend of inflation in the last 10 months.

It had targeted to keep the average inflation within 5.6 per cent in FY23 and it was revised upwards to 7 per cent as consumer prices surged owing to the war-induced disruption in the international commodity market and the global energy crisis.

The Consumer Price Index averaged 8.64 per cent as of April, BBS data showed.

The government's revenue collection target is also set to be missed.

The National Board of Revenue was given a task to raise Tk 370,000 crore in FY23. It collected Tk 247,390 crore in the 10 months to April, which was 67 per cent of the target.

This means taxmen will have to collect Tk 122,600 crore in the remaining two months of the year, which is ending in June.

If the NBR misses the target, it would be the 11th consecutive year that the revenue goal will remain unachieved.

The situation is the same regarding the implementation of the development budget: Tk 119,064 crore was spent in July-April against the revised target of Tk 236,560 crore, which accounted for half of the target.

MA Razzaque, research director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, described the targets on GDP growth, inflation, revenue collection and ADP spending as the ""heart"" of the national budget.

""But so far, we have been in the slow lane when it comes to attaining the goals,"" he said.

He said 2022-23 has been a very difficult year for Bangladesh and the budget was formulated at a time when the impacts of the pandemic were still significant and the war in Ukraine was raging.

""Under such circumstances, setting a 7.5 per cent growth target was unrealistic.""

Razzaque, however, said although the average inflation is still high, the government should have managed it through proper policy measures.

Prof Mustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said the targets were set without considering the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war.

""The government did not anticipate that the war would have a serious impact on the overall budget. As a result, the budget was business as usual.""

He explained the government could not assess the impact the conflict would have on the foreign exchange and the exchange rate.

The reserve has fallen by about 28 per cent in the past one year while the taka lost its value by about 25 per cent against the US dollar.

""Due to the weakness in the macroeconomic policy, the government had set the targets without acknowledging the reality,"" said Prof Rahman.

The economist went on to say that the CPD had urged the government to revisit the budget two or three months after it was unveiled considering the global scenario.

""Now we can see where the budget stands when it comes to achieving its major targets.""

CPD's Rahman said the government ignored the reality while setting the targets and there are structural weaknesses behind the slower ADP execution and lower tax collection.

About the budget deficit, he said the current deficit might go past 5 per cent of GDP and it may shoot up to 6 per cent in 2023-24.

""The higher deficit will bring about challenges as the government would have to rely on the banking sector to finance the shortfall. Then, it will have adverse effects on the private sector. And if the government borrows from the central bank, it will stoke inflationary pressure.""

The government borrowed Tk 78,560 crore from the banking sector as of May 10, against the full fiscal-year target of Tk 106,334 crore.

The noted economist suggested the government focus on stabilising the economy and containing inflation, revisit subsidy allocation and give subsidies to the sectors that need the most.

In order to tackle inflationary pressures, he called for expanding social safety net programmes.

The government will have to adjust the interest rate of national savings certificates as people are not very keen about them owing to the lower return, he said, calling for fast-tracking the implementation of foreign-funded projects.

Prof Razzaque suggested the government undertake effective policy measures in the next budget for 2023-24 to restore macroeconomic stability.",2023-05-18 02:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/economy/news/major-targets-current-budget-still-unmet-3323036,2023-05-18 10:18:59,thedailystar
38,"Saat Masjid Road: Trees felled for facelift, a new median strip","Say DSCC officials; experts slam the move, say the trees could’ve been easily saved

City life comes with rapid change. But for the residents of Dhanmondi what didn't change for long were the trees and plants on the median of Saat Masjid Road. Bursting with blossoms in spring and summer, the krishnachuras and the radhachuras, among other trees, became a part of their lives.

Now the trees are almost gone, leaving residents baffled as to why a development project has to be carried out at the expense of those beautiful trees which also served as a bulwark against environmental degradation.

At a time when environmental issues are at the heart of most policy discussions, the felling of several hundred trees by the Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) on Saat Masjid Road has raised more questions than answers.

According to DSCC officials, the trees were cut to correct the faulty alignment of the median on the Dhanmondi thoroughfare. The existing median divides the road unevenly, meaning the opposing lanes are not of the same width. The correction was needed to ensure smooth traffic flow as the road now has to accommodate more buses under a new route plan.

Although they could not confirm exactly when the trees were planted, Dhanmondi residents said they had been planted at least 15 years ago.

Talking about the issue, officials also referred to an integrated Tk 1,719-crore project called ""Different Infrastructure Development Project"" (DIDP), under which the DSCC is carrying out a number of infrastructural and beautification projects.

The DIDP includes beautification of footpaths and median strips and construction of public urinals. It covers infrastructural development and beautification on four different roads --Saat Masjid Road, the stretch from Golapshah Mazar in Gulistan to Bangabazar in Fulbaria, the stretch from Palashi to Nilkhet and the stretch from Gulistan underpass to Golapshah Mazar. It also aims to widen the two-kilometre median on the Saat Masjid Road from 36 inches to 42 inches.

However, environmentalists and urban experts have raised questions about the rationale for cutting the trees which are vital for fresh air in an increasingly polluted city. They believe the project could be carried out without cutting the trees.

According to environmentalists, the DSCC has cut down nearly 600 trees from the median without having secured any permission from the forest department, which is illegal.

""The DSCC is doing it on the pretext of beautification and facilitating vehicular movement. However, it serves no such purpose,"" said Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela).

Terming the move poorly planned, Adil Mohammad Khan, former general secretary of Bangladesh Institute of Planners, said that the development work on Saat Masjid Road could have been done by protecting the trees because the condition of the median was fit for the purpose.

The DSCC did not discuss it with professionals, nor did they care about public opinion though professional engagement and public participation are the two necessary factors before deciding on such issues, said Adil.

""Beautification by getting rid of trees is unacceptable,"" he added.

DSCC Chief Engineer Saleh Ahmed said they had to cut the trees to relocate the median at the centre of the road.

""Under new route plans, buses running from Ghatarchar to Kanchpur via Basila will ply Saat Masjid Road. But the problem is that the width of the road was not equal on both sides. So, we're making the width of both sides equal by relocating the median,"" Saleh Ahmed told The Daily Star.

""Besides, there were 10 to 12 intersections on this road. We will close them all except for four to five so that pedestrians and vehicles can cross safely,"" he added.

DSCC Mayor Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh on Tuesday told reporters that trees were cut only when there was no other alternative.

""Trees are being cut down on Saat Masjid Road to introduce an automatic traffic system. Residents of the area have already started to get the benefits of the ongoing development work,"" he said.

Responding to a question, the mayor said, ""The information about the felling of 563 trees is false. We have cut only a few trees and the rest have fallen.

""We are sorry for the trees but we will plant three times the number that has been cut. Also, no more big trees will be planted on the median.""

About not securing permission from the department of forest, a DSCC high-up, preferring not to be named, said, ""It is necessary to take permission to cut the trees which are valued for timber but the trees which we have cut had no such value.""

Terming this claim unfounded, Adil stressed that cutting trees on such a long stretch of road without the permission of the forest officials is illegal.

Echoing Adil, Iqbal Habib, joint secretary of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon, said indiscriminate cutting of trees for implementing any project is illogical.

""The DSCC should have done a proper study considering the trees as living beings, but they didn't,"" Habib added.

Communications expert Prof Md Shamsul Hoque of Buet said he did not notice any anomaly with the median on Saat Masjid Road.

He also said that the decision to close so many intersections on the road might have a negative impact on curbing congestion.",2023-05-18 01:20:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/saat-masjid-road-trees-felled-facelift-new-median-strip-3322826,2023-05-18 10:19:00,thedailystar
39,"Russia, China sending deadly aid to Myanmar's military: UN expert","Members of the Myanmar army patrol during the Myanmar's New Year water festival, locally known as Thingyan, in Yangon on April 13, 2023. Photo: AFP

Myanmars military has imported at least $1 billion in arms and other material since it staged a coup in February 2021, a UN expert said on Wednesday in a new report that calls out Russia and China for aiding the junta's deadly campaign to crush its opposition.

Since the military seized power and jailed democratic leaders, some opponents of military rule have taken up arms, in places joining ethnic minority insurgents, and the military has responded with air strikes and heavy weapons, including in civilian areas.

Russian-made Mi-35 helicopter, MiG-29 fighter jets and Yak-130 light aircraft, and Chinese K-8 jets, have been most frequently used to conduct air strikes that have hit schools, medical facilities, homes and other civilian sites, said the report by Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar.

In a single attack on a village gathering organized by the military's opponents in Sagaing region on April 11, two bombs dropped from a Yak-130 killed at least 160 people, reportedly including nearly 40 children, the report said.

Myanmars military says it is targeting insurgents and after the Sagaing attack said any civilians killed were probably supporters of opponents it calls ""terrorists."" The good news is we now know who is supplying these arms and the jurisdictions in which they operate, Andrews said in a statement, calling for UN members to step up and stop the flow of arms with a complete ban on the arms transfers to Myanmars military, enforcement of existing bans and coordinated sanctions.

The UN expert used trade data to detail transfers of arms and other goods, including raw materials for Myanmars domestic arms production, to the military since the coup worth $406 million from Russia and $267 million from China, including from state-owned entities in both countries.

State-owned entities in India also made a smaller volume of transfers, and companies in Singapore, India and Thailand were also involved in transfers to the military.

Some $227 million of material came from Rosoboronexport, Moscows state-owned arms exporter, which has transferred SU-30 fighter jets, supplies for MiG-29 jets and rocket launch systems to Myanmar, the report said.

Other Russian companies provided a range of tools, equipment and spare parts for Russian-supplied weapons systems, it said.

Weaponry provided by Russian suppliers has been used to commit probable war crimes and crimes against humanity in Myanmar, the report said.

The UN missions of the five countries mentioned in the report as sources of arms and material did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

At a news conference in New York, Andrews said Chinese officials had earlier criticized his reporting, saying he was vilifying legitimate trade in arms and operating outside his mandate by conducting analysis. Russian officials had expressed a similar response, Andrews said.",2023-05-17 20:08:26,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/asia/news/russia-china-sending-deadly-aid-myanmars-military-un-expert-3323041,2023-05-18 10:19:00,thedailystar
40,"Old buses, trucks to be sent to the scrap yards","Gazette in this regard likely in days

The government has decided that buses and trucks will be scrapped after 20 and 25 years of being on the road.

A circular of the Road Transport and Highways Division issued yesterday revealed the move, the first of its kind in Bangladesh.

The order will come into force through the publication of a gazette.

The gazette will be issued within a few days, BRTA Chairman Nur Mohammad Mazumder told The Daily Star.

Experts said proper implementation of the move would improve road safety.

The Road Transport and Highways Division has also prepared a draft guideline for scrapping old vehicles. In the draft, it has been mentioned that no vehicle owner would be able to register a new vehicle if they own a vehicle that has exceeded the ""service life"" set by the government.

The draft Motor Vehicle Scrapping Guideline-2023 said the government would be outsourcing the vehicle scrapping job to private firms enlisted with the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) and under the BRTA's supervision.

The move comes more than four years after a special committee formed by the National Road Safety Council recommended setting the usable life of commercial vehicles to reduce road crashes and help bring discipline to the road transport sector.

Thousands of unfit and rickety vehicles are on the roads and the rising numbers of crashes and deaths have become a major concern.

""This is a good move for road safety but intensive monitoring and quality enforcement is the key to getting positive results,"" prominent transport expert Prof Shamsul Haque said.

Prof Shamsul, also the director of the Accident Research Institute at Buet, told The Daily Star yesterday that there are enough laws, rules and guidelines for the road transport sector but the problem lies in implementation and enforcement.

Due to the lack of monitoring and enforcement, one will see hundreds of unregistered and unfit vehicles even at the periphery of the capital, he said.

He, however, said the usable life of a vehicle shortens due to poor road quality, overloading, and improper maintenance. And these can lead to a vehicle having major issues even within the government-set service life of the bus or truck.

SERVICE LIFE

The BRTA in 2010 banned buses aged over 20 years and trucks over 25 years in the capital. The old vehicles then started operating on inter-district highways.

In March 2019, a committee, led by transport leader Shajahan Khan, made 111 recommendations to curb road accidents and bring discipline in the sector. The recommendations include setting the service life of buses and trucks to 20 and 25 years. It mentioned that old vehicles cause road crashes and congestion due to breakdowns.

The government formed a task force led by the home minister to implement the recommendations.

BRTA Chairman Mazumder told The Daily Star that the BRTA had sought opinions from stakeholders regarding the draft guideline. ""The guideline will be finalised in the shortest possible time after an inter-ministerial meeting.""

Mazumder said the BRTA would take outdated vehicles off the roads and would not wait for the approval of the guideline.

Khondaker Enayet Ullah, secretary general of Bangladesh Road Transport Owners Association, said, ""We support the decision.""

Replying to a question, he said he had no idea how many outdated vehicles were in the country. ""But we think there are such vehicles in the districts.""

DRAFT GUIDELINE

The preamble to the draft guideline mentions that the move is required to improve road safety, bring discipline to the transport sector and reduce pollution.

The guideline will also be applicable to written off vehicles of the government and non-government organisations, vehicles damaged by fire, explosion or natural calamities, illegal and banned vehicles, and vehicles ordered for scrapping by courts or other authorities concerned.

As per the guideline, the owner has to submit the necessary papers for the outdated vehicle to the BRTA which would hand over the vehicle to the firm scrapping.

The government would give special benefits to owners who would have the document certifying that they have scrapped their old vehicles, it read.

The BRTA would issue gazettes cancelling the registrations of scrapped vehicles.

A seven-member committee led by the director (engineering) of the BRTA will decide which parts of the vehicles could be recycled and fix the price of scrap metal, plastic and other products, it added.

Violation of the guideline would be tantamount to violation of the Road Transport Act-2018, it read.",2023-05-18 01:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/transport/news/old-buses-trucks-be-sent-the-scrap-yards-3322796,2023-05-18 10:19:01,thedailystar
41,Guardiola salutes 'special' Man City,"Pep Guardiola said his ""special"" Manchester City stars had proved a point after their 4-0 rout of Real Madrid booked a Champions League final showdown with Inter Milan.

Bernardo Silva scored City's first two goals at the Etihad Stadium before Manuel Akanji and Julian Alvarez netted to cap a swaggering display in the semi-final second leg.

It was a cathartic victory for Guardiola's men after they were beaten by Real in last season's semi-finals.

On that occasion, City conceded two late goals before losing in extra-time, leading to claims Guardiola's players lacked character.

The City boss believes this ruthless demolition of holders Real should silence any remaining doubters.

""I had the feeling we had one year of pain in our stomach. What happened last season, today went out,"" he said.

""It was so painful last season, when people said these players lacked character and in one year we've shown again how special this group of players is.

""I say congratulations to all our organisation, our chairman, our owner, until the last person because they work with a real purpose and we are there!""

City's 5-1 aggregate victory kept the Premier League leaders on course for a remarkable season.

They can win the title with a victory against Chelsea on Sunday, face Manchester United in the FA Cup final on June 3 and head to Istanbul to play Inter as they bid to lift the Champions League for the first time.

""When you reach the Champions League final, you have to celebrate but unfortunately we won't have time because on Sunday we have the chance to win the Premier League,"" Guardiola said.

""A final against an Italian team is not the best gift, honestly. They are competitive. This victory will get a lot of compliments but we have time to prepare mentally.""

Asked if City's display was one of their best during his seven-year reign, Guardiola added: ""Yes definitely. We just had to win one game, be ourselves.

""Madrid, what a team, but we wanted to win. What happened last season happened. We didn't have the luck.

""But today we had the feeling that the people were ready. The players made a lot of jokes, I didn't feel tension and I had the feeling we were ready to give this performance.""

- 'A beautiful night' -

Silva said he was motivated to make amends for an underwhelming display in the 1-1 draw against Real in the first leg.

He fooled Real keeper Thibaut Courtois with a sublime near-post finish to put City ahead in the 23rd minute and netted their second with a header eight minutes before half-time.

""My performance in the first game in Madrid was not the one I wanted and I wanted to compensate that,"" he said.

""Today I had to do better for my team-mates and the fans and that is what I tried to do. I am small but good with my head! It is a beautiful night for us.""

Real defender Dani Carvajal admitted his side had no answers to City's relentless pressure.

""We played a rival who were better than us in this match. They pretty well overwhelmed us,"" he said.

""We can recognise that City were better. We were lacking something. It wasn't attitude we were lacking but we allowed ourselves to be pressed back too much.

""We knew that City were very strong at home but after the first leg we were left with the feeling that we could be better than this here, better on the ball.""

With Barcelona winning the Spanish title this term, Real face an uncertain future that is likely to see boss Carlo Ancelotti depart.

But Carvajal said: ""We are Madrid, we'll come back stronger and we'll work really hard next season to be back at this stage of the tournament.""

42,Montana to become first US state to ban TikTok,"Montana Governor Greg Gianforte on Wednesday signed legislation to ban Chinese-owned TikTok from operating in the state to protect residents from alleged intelligence gathering by China.

This makes it the first US state to ban the popular short video app.

Montana will make it unlawful for Google and Apple's app stores to offer TikTok within the state, but will not impose any penalties on individuals using the app.

The ban is to take effect from Jan 1, 2024, and is almost certain to face legal challenges.

TikTok, owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, did not respond to a Reuters question asking if it planned legal action.

Earlier, TikTok issued a statement saying that the new law ""infringes on the First Amendment rights of the people of Montana by unlawfully banning TikTok"", and said it will ""continue working to defend the rights of our users inside and outside of Montana"".

TikTok has more than 150 million American users.

It has faced growing calls from US lawmakers and state officials to ban the app nationwide over concerns about potential Chinese government influence over the platform.

The app has become wildly popular with teens.

According to the Pew Research Centre, 67 per cent of US teens aged 13 to 17 use TikTok, and 16 per cent of all teens say they use the app almost constantly.

TikTok has said that the ""vast majority"" of its users are over the age of 18.

In March, a congressional committee grilled TikTok chief executive Chew Shou Zi about whether the Chinese government could access user data or influence what Americans see on the app.

But calls to ban TikTok nationwide or give the Biden administration new powers to crack down or ban TikTok have not advanced in Congress.

Mr Gianforte, a Republican, said the Bill will further ""our shared priority to protect Montanans from Chinese Communist Party surveillance"".

TikTok has repeatedly denied that it has ever shared data with the Chinese government and has said the company would not do so if asked.",2023-05-18 04:04:34,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/science-gadgets-and-tech/tech-news/news/montana-become-first-us-state-ban-tiktok-3323116,2023-05-18 10:19:02,thedailystar
43,City matchwinner Silva hails 'beautiful' night,"Manchester City's man-of-the-match Bernardo Silva hailed their Champions League semi-final thrashing of Real Madrid on Wednesday as a ""beautiful"" and ""wonderful"" night.

Silva said he was disappointed with his performance in last week's 1-1 first-leg draw in Madrid, so was thrilled to score the first two goals in the 4-0 win in Manchester that secured a 5-1 aggregate victory and a place in the Champions League final.

""It's a beautiful night for us. We knew it was going to be tough. But to beat this Madrid team 4-0 at home, it was wonderful,"" the Portuguese midfielder said.

""A wonderful feeling to be in the final again, and hopefully this time we can try and win it,"" added Silva, whose team lost the Champions League final to Chelsea two years ago.

""My performance in the first game in Madrid wasn't the one I wanted, and I wanted to try and compensate for that because I didn't feel very good at all after the first game. And here today, I had to do better for my team mates and the fans.

""We were very resilient, we very passionate and organised at the same time. I'm so, so happy with that performance.""

Silva effectively won the game for City with his first-half brace, the second a clever header.

""I'm small, but I'm good with my head!"" he laughed.

The English side will face Inter Milan in the final.

""They look very strong, very organised defensively and quick on the counter-attack,"" Silva said of the Italian side.

""It's going to be tough, but we're going to fight.""

'SUPERIOR OPPONENT'

Real Madrid defender Dani Carvajal was gracious in defeat.

""The opponents were better than us in the second leg, they have outplayed us by a large margin. They were a superior opponent,"" he told Spain's Movistar Plus TV.

""We lacked a little ... I wouldn't say attitude, but we closed back down too early. After the break we had our best minutes. We'll come back stronger.

""We knew that they are very strong at home, but after the sensations of the first leg we all thought we could play a better game.""

Manchester City's Jack Grealish, who tormented the Spaniards from the wing at the Etihad Stadium, said he had always dreamed of playing in the Champions League.

""It's unbelievable ... I don't think a lot of teams would do that to Real Madrid,"" he said.

""I don't know what it is, but it feels unstoppable.""

Defender Kyle Walker, who matched Real's speedy forward Vinicius Jr. for pace and kept him quiet all evening, said it had been a tough game.

""I thought the lads dug in well, they controlled the ball really well, especially in the first half ... We got over the line and that's the main thing,"" he said.

Matching Vinicius required immense self-belief.

""You've got to have a little bit of arrogance, like the attackers do,"" Walker said. ""I always say go toe-to-toe with them, I use my pace.""",2023-05-18 01:44:17,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/city-matchwinner-silva-hails-beautiful-night-3323071,2023-05-18 10:19:03,thedailystar
44,City crush Real to cruise to Champions League final,"Manchester City marched into the Champions League final for the second time in three seasons after outclassing holders Real Madrid 4-0 for a 5-1 aggregate victory at a raucous Etihad Stadium on Wednesday.

Bernardo Silva's first-half double put City in control against the 14-time European champions and an own goal by Eder Militao after the break and a late fourth from Julian Alvarez sealed the deal for Pep Guardiola's side as they avenged last year's bitter semi-final loss.

With Inter Milan awaiting in the final, City will now be huge favourites to finally deliver the trophy Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Mansour has craved since buying the club in 2008, having lost to Chelsea two years ago.

City are now unbeaten in 26 home matches in the competition and that run was never in danger once Portuguese midfielder Silva whipped a shot past Thibaut Courtois in the 23rd minute and then headed his side's second in the 37th minute.

The second half was almost a formality as holders Real, bidding to win the trophy for a sixth time in 10 seasons, were outplayed by a relentless City side closing in on a treble.

And there was no way back for Carlo Ancelotti's side when Kevin De Bruyne's free kick flicked off Militao in the 76th minute.

Alvarez put the icing on the cake of a memorable night for City with a clinical finish after coming on as late replacement for Erling Haaland.",2023-05-17 20:55:42,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/city-crush-real-cruise-champions-league-final-3323056,2023-05-18 10:19:04,thedailystar
45,Netflix says ad-supported plan has nearly 5 million users,"Netflix on Wednesday wooed marketers with word that its nascent ad-supported plan has grown to nearly five million users globally.

The streaming television star touted its shows, viewer demographics, and more at a virtual ""Upfront"" presentation to advertisers.

""Since early this year, our ads member base has more than doubled,"" Netflix cochief Greg Peters said as the event kicked off.

""On average, more than a quarter of our sign-ups now choose the ads plan in countries where it's available.""

As growth at Netflix cooled last year, the Silicon Valley-based streaming company focused on creating a lower priced subscription tier with advertising.

Membership in its ad-supported tier has more than doubled since early this year, growing to nearly five million, according to Netflix.

Netflix in April said that its total number of subscribers hit a record high 232.5 million.

""We share a common goal,"" Peters told advertisers during Upfront.

""You want to connect consumers with your amazing brands, and we want to connect them with amazing entertainment they'll love.""

More than 70 percent of those subscribing to the ad-supported plan at Netflix range in age from 18 to 49, according to the company.

""Netflix shows and movies are generating global audiences that are many times bigger than our closest competitors,"" said Netflix cochief Ted Sarandos.

During Upfront, Netflix touted its line-up of shows including new productions such as ""Griselda"" with Sofia Vergara and new seasons of hit originals including ""Stranger Things.""",2023-05-18 03:23:30,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/science-gadgets-and-tech/tech-news/news/netflix-says-ad-supported-plan-has-nearly-5-million-users-3323096,2023-05-18 10:19:05,thedailystar
46,Early action key to dengue control,"Lessons from past years must reflect in decisions by relevant authorities

Dengue is hardly a seasonal nuisance anymore with cases being reported round the year, although the peak time may still coincide with the beginning of monsoon around June-July. That is when things start to go downhill. So far this year, 12 dengue patients died and 1,261 were hospitalised. Last year, a total of 281 patients died – the highest on record in Bangladesh – while 62,382 were hospitalised, most of them in the second half of the year. That means, if the authorities had any plan to launch an all-out drive to prevent another deadly outbreak, the time is now.

Early action determines to a large extent how the dengue record book will look like down the year. It is all the more important given the increasing severity of infections, with there now being four distinct serotypes of the virus: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. The addition of the fourth last year has resulted in a higher number of fatalities despite fewer infections compared to 2019, when a staggering 1.13 lakh cases were recorded. Meanwhile, unplanned urbanisation – one of the main reasons for the spread of the disease – has been persistent, meaning that dengue will be harder to control going forward.

Experts have already warned that the country may witness an even worse outbreak this year as the presence of Aedes mosquitoes increased in the early days of summer. Earlier this month, the DGHS said that there is a risk of death for those who had previously been infected if they are reinfected by a different type of dengue, the possibility of which has grown because of the presence of multiple serotypes. This will require proper scientific interventions. For now, however, the task for the city corporations, municipalities and other relevant agencies is simple: conduct anti-mosquito drives, clean dengue hotspots and breeding grounds, communicate precautionary measures to all at-risk households, ensure early detection, and prepare hospitals for a likely patient surge.

Any success this year will depend on a combination of better planning, early action and coordinated interventions. One persistent complaint against the relevant authorities has been the lack of early response, which, after the disastrous year that 2022 has been, we hope they will address. That should extend to not just Dhaka but all other cities and towns as well. We must learn from past mistakes and act quickly to prevent another dengue outbreak.",2023-05-18 02:01:02,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/early-action-key-dengue-control-3323066,2023-05-18 10:19:06,thedailystar
47,Greater effort needed to stop sand extraction from Teesta,"Government must protect our rivers from being polluted, encroached or harmed in other ways

The senseless and continuous destruction of our rivers for the sake of personal benefit is deeply saddening. According to a new report by this daily, a powerful syndicate has been extracting sand from Teesta River at the Mohishkhocha union of Aditmari upazila in Lalmonirhat. This has endangered not just the health of the river, but also the lives and livelihoods of those who live on its banks.

With the monsoon season right around the corner, locals have expressed fear that their homesteads and agricultural land along the river will be at risk of erosion owing to continued sand extraction, inevitably paying the price for the exploits of an unscrupulous few. It is quite telling that those directly affected by this feel they do not have the means to stop this activity because of the involvement of politically connected people in the syndicate. Reportedly, the local administration recently conducted a drive against sand extraction in Teesta. They destroyed one of the machines used for extraction and fined three people in this connection. Locals, however, said that those in charge conduct such operations irregularly and usually fine workers – employed by the syndicate – but those truly responsible are not held accountable.

This, we must say, only helps keep the sand extraction business alive.

Without ensuring accountability for those committing crimes against rivers, we cannot stop such practices. It is no secret that our rivers are dying. In the 57 years until 2020, at least 158 rivers dried up in Bangladesh. Indiscriminate disposal of waste as well as irresponsible river management have turned once-mighty and healthy rivers like the Buriganga, Meghna, Kirtankhola, Galachipa and Payra into veritable garbage dumps. Encroachment and unplanned development have finished many others.

The question is, why are the authorities responsible for our rivers not doing anything to reverse this trend? It is because of their inaction and indifference that Bangladesh is a Land of Dying Rivers now. This must stop. The authorities must take stern action against the perpetrators of river pollution and destruction.",2023-05-17 21:51:19,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/greater-effort-needed-stop-sand-extraction-teesta-3323061,2023-05-18 10:19:07,thedailystar
48,Why the DSA should be scrapped,"The government’s failure in delivering on its promise to establish safeguards against the arbitrary or excessive application of the law is noteworthy.

Over the last few months, the draconian Digital Security Act (DSA), 2018 has come under intense scrutiny. Journalists, lawyers, human rights defenders, teachers, students, and various civic bodies at home and rights organisations abroad have been demanding a re-examination of the law. While some are asking for its thorough amendment, others firmly hold the view that the act needs to be repealed. The rash increase in the law's application in recent months and the death of a woman charged under the DSA in custody appear to have partly swayed the opinion of the common masses against the law. Though many a time senior functionaries of the state publicly acknowledged the gaps that exist in the law, little was done to amend it. As international pressure mounted, the law minister conceded to consider only amending the rule pertaining to the act. Jurists and activists raise the question: can any substantive law be modified through a rule, a subordinate legislation?

While the state remained unyielding, political opponents and dissenting voices suffered immeasurably. Many women and children also became victims of the DSA. It was at this point that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) called on the Bangladesh authorities to impose an immediate moratorium on the use of DSA and ""to reform comprehensively its provisions to bring them in line with the requirements of international human rights law."" The OHCHR recommended scrapping of sections 21 and 28 and amending eight other sections of the law. The commissioner reminded the government that his office had consistently raised concerns about the overly broad and ill-defined provisions of the DSA. He called for the creation of an independent judicial panel to review all pending cases brought under the DSA with a view to those accused being released.

The government's failure in delivering on its promise to establish safeguards against the arbitrary or excessive application of the law is noteworthy. It was only on May 3 that the law minister announced that a few provisions of the DSA would be amended by September. While the ministerial pronouncement has been welcomed by those who favour amendment, albeit with a degree of scepticism, others remain resolute in their demand for scrapping the law. This piece presents the arguments for repealing the DSA, made at a recent webinar organised by Nagorik, a platform for human rights and the rule of law.

The principal weakness of the DSA is that many of its provisions impinge on citizens' rights: freedom of expression and the right to privacy of communication. There was little disputation that its key aim was reinstating Section 57 of the ICT Act, 2006 (amended in 2009 and 2013) which the state was forced to discard in view of widespread public condemnation of its misuse.

The participants believed that the law, formulated weeks before the 2018 elections, in all likelihood, was intended to curtail key fundamental rights accorded by the constitution. It also contradicts several other laws, regulations and guidelines. Most importantly, it contradicts the right to equal protection of law as guaranteed by Article 27 of the constitution. Several provisions of the DSA directly contravene the much-celebrated Right to Information (RTI) Act. The DSA has slashed some important rights that citizens enjoy under other laws. For example, the Disclosure of Public Interest Information (Protection) Act, 2011 provides adequate protection to whistleblowers for exposing wrongdoers, but Section 32 of DSA prohibits access to that information in the name of state secrecy and security. Likewise, while the Children Act, 2013 provides substantial protection to children from being prosecuted in criminal cases, the DSA has been indiscriminately applied to children as well.

A major weakness of the law is its inconsistency with the other existing laws. Section 29 of DSA provides for three years' jail sentence for defamation and up to Tk 5 lakh fine; the punishment gets harsher for committing the offence a second time. Section 500 of the Penal Code, on the other hand, provides two years' jail sentence with a fine for the same offence. The offence remains the same, but the punishment differs in two different platforms, which is discriminatory and not tenable as per provisions of Article 27 of the constitution. On several occasions, ministerial promises were made that the state would treat journalists with particular care in registering cases against them under the DSA. Does preferential treatment of a particular group in the application of the law not breach the equality clause enshrined in Article 27 of the constitution?

In several cases, the accused have alleged that they were tortured in custody. Two detainees, Mushtaq Ahmed and Sultana Jasmine, died in such facilities, with families claiming they died due to torture.

Sections 17 (on unauthorised access to information infrastructure), 18 (on unauthorised access to computers, digital devices, computer systems, etc), 19 (on damaging computers and computer systems), 20 (pertaining to change of computer code), 33 (unauthorised access acquisition and storage of information), and 34 (on hacking) of the DSA suffer from several weaknesses. Many of these provisions remain vague and undefined. Those convey the message that the law did not adequately consider the issue of intent and thus failed to distinguish between criminal acts and creative pursuits and between hacking for public interest and hacking with criminal intent.

As a state party to several international human rights treaties, it is incumbent on Bangladesh to abide by the provisions of those instruments. Any restriction imposed on freedom of expression and communication must uphold three fundamental principles: a) should be established by law; b) have to be framed with legitimate aims; and c) the necessity and proportionality doctrines should be strictly adhered to. The DSA does not meet principles (b) and (c) and thus falls short of upholding international standards.

In addition to identifying substantive anomalies of the law with the constitution and other laws and regulations, the participants of the webinar highlighted serious gaps in its enforcement. Since its inception in 2018, the law has become a major source of criminalisation of legitimate expression, judicial harassment and suffering for the innocent. A review of 1,228 cases of Dhaka Cyber Tribunal, under the ICT Act and DSA, filed between October 15, 2018 and March 31, 2021, informs that 47 percent were dismissed at the first hearing. In most such cases, the accused had to endure severe financial and other hardships and mental trauma.

The law requires the police to complete an investigation within 75 days, but that deadline is hardly met. In many cases, if the investigating officers file reports, they do much later than the time stipulated under the law. The act requires the judges to complete trials within six months, and if they cannot meet the deadline, they can request a three-month extension in writing. If the trial does not conclude in time, the judge can continue proceedings by submitting a report to the High Court explaining the delay. In most cases, such a procedure is not followed. Instances were cited in which, even after the cases were quashed, the jail authority took unreasonable time to release the detainee.

The law stipulates the establishment of a Cyber Appellate Tribunal. The state is yet to form the tribunal in more than four years since the law was enacted, and thus the litigants have no other option but to move to the High Court, navigating a complex and time-consuming process.

In several cases, the accused have alleged that they were tortured in custody. Two detainees, Mushtaq Ahmed and Sultana Jasmine, died in such facilities, with families claiming they died due to torture. Recently cases have been reported in which the accused were subjected to involuntary disappearance for lengths of time before subsequently ""shown arrested"" by law enforcement agencies. Such treatment of detainees is in stark violation of Articles 31, 32 and 33 of the constitution and the provisions of the Torture and Custodial Death (Prohibition) Act, 2013. It also breaches Supreme Court directives on the treatment of detainees issued in the BLAST vs Bangladesh & Others case.

The act effectively criminalises people's initiatives for good governance. The lodging of a number of cases against active citizens exposing wrongdoings of state functionaries and people's representatives and expressing concerns about public health issues during the Covid pandemic is a case in point.

The participants noted that contrary to children, anti-trafficking, and migration laws that ensured a reasonable degree of stakeholder consultation, the DSA was formulated with little input from the stakeholders, particularly from civil society. The vast and disproportionate number of cases filed against the political opposition and those expressing independent views since its inception only indicate that the DSA has become a handy tool to suppress dissent. Also, it has a dampening effect on critical thinking and creative quests. Contrary to those who view the DSA as a purposeful and necessary law that requires minor amends, the webinar participants unanimously rejected such contention and called for its immediate abrogation.

49,UN’s commemoration of Nakba and the West’s complicity,"The two-state solution is not viable today, and never has been, because of the West’s unconditional support for Israel, which itself is responsible for the unfinished Nakba.

Amid the risk of a third intifada looming over the Israel-Palestine conflict, the United Nations, on May 15, officially commemorated Nakba, the ethnic cleansing of roughly 700,000 Palestinians in the process of Israel's creation in 1948. Every year on this day, while Israelis celebrate their independence – a moment of pride for the long-persecuted Jewish community – Palestinians around the world protest the ongoing occupation and oppression.

The UN's commemoration was welcomed by Palestine, harshly condemned by Israel, and rejected by major Western friends of the latter. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called the commemoration ""historic,"" given the General Assembly's role to partition British-ruled Palestine into two states, one Arab and one Jewish, with Jerusalem placed under a special international regime.

Though it is indeed a historic gesture, the international and Western support for Palestinian human rights has a faint heartbeat. The US, UK, and members of the EU, who strongly uphold the rhetoric of the two-state solution, did not attend the event. They chose to tread on the safer side, and by signalling their ""neutrality"" on Nakba, the West has blatantly revealed its lack of empathy for Palestinian calls for justice. This moment serves as a reflection, and a reminder, of the Western complicity in perpetuating the injustice against Palestinians. The two-state solution is not viable today, and has never been, because of the West's unconditional support for Israel, which itself is responsible for the unfinished Nakba.

For Palestinians, Nakba, which means ""catastrophe,"" is integral to their current resistance and identity. The carnage and instability that began 75 years ago continues to be a daily occurrence. Just days before the UN's event, a five-day flare-up on the Gaza Strip left 30 Palestinians killed, injured 90 others, while destroying 50 homes and displacing 950 people. A ceasefire, negotiated by Egypt, prevented further escalation. But this movie of violence and ceasefire plays like a broken record in the region.

The Israeli attack last week came even despite another fragile ceasefire in place, after cross-frontier exchanges followed the death of Khader Adnan, a prominent political figure affiliated with Islamic Jihad, in Israeli custody. Israel continues to detain Palestinians, encroach their lands, launch ""pre-emptive"" airstrikes on the grounds of ""self-defence"" against terrorist groups, Palestine's Islamist Jihad party and Iran-backed Hamas. Of course, the rise of militancy in Palestine is a matter of safety concern for Israeli citizens – as it is for Palestinian citizens. But if there was ever a debate regarding who the victim or oppressor is, the disparity in the casualties between Palestinians and Israelis in each episodic blow-up should have put that to bed.

Just last year, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the West Bank took the bloodiest turn on record since the second intifada, killing 150 Palestinians and 30 Israelis. In 2021, Israeli forces killed 236 Palestinians on the Gaza Strip, and thousands lost their homes. Time and time again, the West has backed the ""self-defence"" narrative that Israel has used to dodge accountability.

Palestinians are repressed in countless other forms: illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and the apartheid system that subjects Palestinians in Israel-occupied territories to draconian laws. But Western sympathisers, who visit the region and tepidly call for peace, continue to turn a deaf ear towards the plight of Palestinians.

It is incredibly shameful that the US, UK, Canada, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands – all big global players who claim to champion the highest standards of democracy, were among the 30 nations who outrightly voted against the UN resolution to commemorate Nakba.

Explaining the decision behind the US' absence in the UN event, the White House spokesperson told Axios that the US ""has long-standing concerns over anti-Israel bias within the UN system, which is counterproductive to peace. We do not support events organized by bodies designed to perpetuate anti-Israel bias."" The choice of words from the White House starkly shows that their own long-standing bias on the matter remains ironclad.

Despite their garrulous calls for a two-state solution, the US has unabashedly failed to condemn Netanyahu's settlement policies that have foreclosed the options of the two-state solution itself. Even after the killing of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh last year, the US failed to independently launch an investigation. The US has always backed the oppression of Palestinians, through their commitment to ensure that Israel maintains its Qualitative Military Edge to ""potential regional threats."" With over $150 billion in financial aid, they've developed Israel's advanced military. And by being an apologist for the far-right government's misuse of military powers against Palestinian civilians, they've let Netanyahu's regime operate with impunity.

The UK, former colonisers of Palestine, also deals with the conflict with similar duplicity. (It is worth mentioning that the UK has never faced their unique historical role in Nakba, and the fact that they paved the way for the 1948 displacement of Palestinians when they issued the Balfour Declaration). In a pact signed this March, the UK pledged to confront ""anti-Israel bias"" in international organisations and opposed using the term ""apartheid"" to describe Israel's oppression of Palestine. For years, the UK has maintained an exclusive arms trade with Israel, and continues to supply drones that are used in surveillance and attacks on Palestinians in Gaza.

Likewise, EU member states increasingly engage in arms trade and economically beef up Israel's forces. But sanctimoniously, the EU released a statement on May 14, welcoming the latest ceasefire and reinstating their readiness to work with ""all partners to bring relief, assist in achieving calm for both Israelis and Palestinians and restore a political horizon."" The readiness is limited to political convenience: members of the EU did not attend the UN's commemoration of Nakba; the president of the European Commission instead sent a special message to celebrate 75 years of Israel's independence, where she praised Israel as a vibrant democracy.

When it comes to Israel and Palestine, the West finds it hard to stick to their so-called moral values, because it's politically difficult. They don't even shy away from disjoining hands with the UN and humanitarian bodies. But if they truly care about peace, the West must come to terms with its own complicity regarding the loss of Palestinian lives. Until then, Israel will have no incentive to comply with international law and Palestinians will continue to suffer. Nakba will go on, as it does, with Israel knowing that powerful governments will stand by them.

50,Bangladesh can become a semiconductor packaging hub,"Recently, there have been discussions going on in the country on developing a semiconductor manufacturing sector, in an effort to diversify our economy and accelerate economic growth. Semiconductor chips, or integrated circuit (IC) chips, are the brains of modern electronic devices. In 2020, more than 932 billion chips were produced in the world – that's more than 116 chips per person. You may be using more than 150 IC chips on a daily basis via your smartphone, depending on the model. In the era of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), the demand for IC chips is only going to rise, which means semiconductor manufacturing will keep growing; the semiconductor market is expected to almost double in value, to become a USD 1 trillion industry, by the end of this decade.

Manufacturing IC chips and integrating them into commercial electronic devices constitute probably the most technologically advanced and complex manufacturing value chain. Simply put, the major steps in semiconductor manufacturing include: 1) IC chip design; 2) silicon wafer production; 3) IC chip fabrication; 4) IC chip packaging, assembly and testing; and 5) integration to systems/commercial products.

In Bangladesh, some IC design-related activities have started recently. But that is not the focus of this article. Out of the steps listed above, IC chip fabrication, also called front-end process, consists of highly sophisticated process steps that need huge capital (several billion US dollars), highly skilled engineers and scientists, and intense involvement in advanced research and development (R&D). Only a few companies in the world are able to do IC fabrication, such as TSMC, Intel, Samsung, Global Foundries, etc. At present, it is not realistic for Bangladesh to enter the IC chip fabrication sector. But what is doable right now is IC chip packaging, assembly and testing.

For simplicity, let's use ""packaging"" to refer to this step, which is also called back-end process. An IC chip, built on a thin single crystal silicon wafer, is vulnerable, fragile, and easily gets damaged when exposed to the ambient atmosphere. So, it must be secured in a package that provides the necessary protection against mechanical, thermal, and chemical damages. An IC chip cannot work on its own. Hence, the package must provide connection between the chip and other circuit components. The package must also dissipate the heat generated because of the current flowing through the chip so as not to overheat and destroy it.

An IC package is a highly complex engineered product that needs multidisciplinary science and engineering expertise to design and manufacture. A lot of value addition happens in this segment of semiconductor manufacturing. Forecast by Straits Research, a leading market research organisation, shows that Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) services are growing at a compound annual growth rate of 8.5 percent, from $37.95 billion in 2021 to an estimated $72.90 billion in 2030.

IC packaging is technologically less demanding and labour-intensive. That is why this segment of semiconductor manufacturing was shifted from the West to the Asia-Pacific region in the early 1980s. Packaging has been thriving in this region that used to offer low wages – e.g. in Malaysia, China, Taiwan, etc. However, labour costs in these countries have risen over the years. IC packaging is again being shifted to new, lower-wage countries. Vietnam, taking advantage of this shift, has been able to attract multi-billion-dollar foreign direct investment (FDI) in semiconductor manufacturing. Companies like Intel, Samsung, LG, AmKor, Panasonic, Foxconn, etc have been investing heavily in high-tech parks in Vietnam. The Philippines is also reaping benefits from this trend. India, too, has entered the semiconductor industry very recently in an emphatic way.

Against this backdrop, Bangladesh can position itself to be an active player, particularly in semiconductor packaging. The country has a good number of advantages, a key advantage being the availability of cheap labour. The country has a young workforce, which is an important asset. The ongoing nationwide effort on the quality assurance of higher education should help convince investors in this tech-intensive sector about the supply of talents in engineering and science. Our solid experience in managing export-oriented industry in other sectors is a plus point as well.

Recent changes in the geopolitical scenario have been compelling the global semiconductor manufacturing sector to diversify its supply chain and relocate some of the process steps to countries that pose lower risks. Bangladesh can be a beneficiary of this development. The country may aim to attract a few prominent international players to bring in FDI by providing attractive tax and other incentives, and by ensuring ease of doing business. This needs consideration and solicitation at the highest level.

Policies should also be friendly to local entrepreneurs. Domestic entrepreneurs with lower budgets may explore the possibility of entering the IC packaging sector by targeting simpler products that require smaller investments. Established packaging manufacturers nowadays tend to target advanced packaging solutions like 2.5D/3D packaging, wafer level packaging, system-in-package, etc. This creates opportunities for smaller/newer players to produce simpler products – e.g. those based on surface-mount technology (SMT), quad-flat no-lead (QFN) package, etc.

The time is ripe for Bangladesh to explore the possibility of entering the lucrative semiconductor manufacturing sector in a substantial way. It may be worth mentioning again that semiconductor manufacturing is probably the most complex value chain there is. So, due diligence by investing time and efforts is vital to comprehend this sector of great promise. Intermingling with international players and experts to create a solid understanding will help in devising good policies and in targeting niche areas to engage in.

51,Recovery from Mocha: Restoring and building resilience,"Bangladesh’s disaster management system, especially in the context of common disasters such as floods and cyclones, has been internationally acclaimed, which has once again been reflected in the preparation for Mocha.

Bangladesh has narrowly escaped massive damage from Severe Cyclone Mocha as it hit the coast of Myanmar, near Cox's Bazar, on Sunday afternoon. Although the extent of destruction in Bangladesh is not as much as it is in Myanmar, urgent attention is required at the recovery stage. Mocha was particularly damaging for Teknaf, St Martin's Island, and Ukhiya in Cox's Bazar. Receiving the cyclone forecast, the government, with the support of the Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) put much effort into ensuring the safety of vulnerable people as per the Standing Orders on Disaster (SOD). The evacuation process was completed promptly and people living in vulnerable locations were taken to cyclone shelters. The initial actions were focused on saving lives through emergency responses.

Now comes the phase of recovery, involving repairing, reconstructing, and, in some cases, rehabilitating. According to media reports, at least 13,500 houses were affected in the chars of Cox's Bazar, St Martin's Island, and the nearby areas, including the Rohingya camps. However, the actual extent of damage caused by Mocha is yet to be evaluated, and is expected to be figured out by rapid need assessment (RNA) and damage and need assessment (DNA) processes.

Bangladesh's disaster management system, especially in the context of common disasters such as floods and cyclones, has been internationally acclaimed, which has once again been reflected in the preparation for Mocha. According to government officials, more than 1.2 million individuals were evacuated as part of the cyclone response. The Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), police, and tourist police worked together to transport all tourists, including those in Cox's Bazar, to safe shelters. Special emphasis was put on the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar, where government protection initiatives had been set in operation. To combat flooding and landslides, 3,000 volunteers in the Rohingya camps had already been trained. Three mobile clinics and mobile units were formed to offer emergency assistance to protect the security of vulnerable populations such as women, children, and the elderly. These efforts place a higher priority on the welfare of women and children because they are more susceptible to disasters than anyone else. Volunteers, both women and men, worked in different facets of emergency response.

Currently, there are 76,144 trained volunteers along the shore, and remarkable initiatives have been implemented in flood-affected regions. It can be said that the emergency responses have been satisfactory, and there is no report of casualties, except a few people suffering minor injuries.

Technological advances, including the launch of Bangabandhu-1 Satellite, have substantially improved the weather forecasting system in the country. Flood warnings can now be sent out three to five days in advance, wherein mathematical models, remote sensing GIS radar, and satellite data analysis are used. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) gives cyclone warnings 7-10 days in advance. Early warnings are broadcast on community radio stations, further enhancing preparedness.

Fortunately, people reacted positively to the government's preparedness ahead of the cyclone. People in the coastal region have become more aware over the last decade and follow the signals in the event of a disaster. However, there are still some people who disregard the risks posed by a disaster. There have been instances where visitors were seen taking selfies in Cox's Bazar and moving around to observe the cyclone out of curiosity. Some men said they were guarding boats and belongings, but had sent women and children to the shelters. Such behaviour not only endangers their safety, but also increases the administration's burden of ensuring a successful evacuation.

Now that the immediate threat has passed, attention must be paid to determine how much damage Cyclone Mocha has caused. It is crucial to guarantee that people who have been staying in the shelters can safely return home. Determining the amount of support and resources needed for recovery will depend on how the damage to crops, infrastructure, animals, and other essential elements of livelihood is assessed. Post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation initiatives should be given high priority to reconstruct from the damages incurred by Cyclone Mocha.

In the post-disaster stage, attention must be given to the affected population who have lost houses, standing crops, and livelihoods. The immediate requirement would be helping them in repairing and reconstructing their houses, reviving agricultural activities and/or finding alternative employment opportunities, and having access to safe drinking water.

As the coastal region is already suffering from salinity intrusion, an increase in rainwater harvesting, safe water preservation, and other practices has been observed. There are also some indigenous practices for water and food preservation that are followed by coastal people. As safe water scarcity is always a challenge in the coastal region, immediate attention should be given to safe drinking water management. Providing medical support to the injured, pregnant, ill people, elderly, and persons with disabilities must be given utmost importance as per the social inclusion agenda endorsed in the revised SOD 2019.

Cyclone Mocha offers evidence of the improvement made in our disaster management and preparedness in recent years. Lives were secured and damage was reduced because of the implementation of early warning systems, training of volunteers and their active participation, and improved forecasting technologies.

To ""build back better"" in post-cyclone periods, more collaborative efforts are essential at national, regional, and international levels. Bangladesh is following an inclusive, whole-of-society disaster risk reduction approach. However, the intersectionality approach needs to be mainstreamed to create more secure and resilient communities using the lessons learnt from Cyclone Mocha.

52,Bangladesh should put the Commonwealth at the centre of its thinking,"Here in London, the news of India's ascendancy has well and truly broken. Politicians and journalists are increasingly aware of Delhi's relevance in global affairs – but few understand the emerging role that Dhaka plays. Today the world's 37th largest economy by nominal GDP, the Centre for Economics and Business Research projects that Bangladesh will stand 20th by 2037, and with economic growth comes geopolitical influence.

As it blossoms anew on the international stage, Bangladesh must remember that it has a readymade network of friends, allies, and partners who share much in common, and who are keen to engage in good faith. The Commonwealth of Nations is the perfect framework for a globally minded Bangladesh, tying together many disparate objectives under one convenient banner.

For one, the Commonwealth is the perfect forum through which Bangladesh can exert influence on the world's established players. The Commonwealth, with a tiny minority of states from the so-called West, has always offered Africa and Asia an equal seat at the table. In the 20th century, the Commonwealth put significant pressure on the UK to change its position on Apartheid, much to the chagrin of the Thatcher government.

As the effects of climate change ravage millions of Bangladeshis, an intra-Commonwealth coalition with Caribbean states devastated by Hurricane Irma and African states suffering acute desertification could provide a powerful platform from which to hold polluting states accountable. Such an alliance could make the case for greater support in curbing global ecological damage from countries like the UK, Canada, and Australia, while sharing techniques and expertise on how to limit the damage.

Just as importantly, Bangladesh can leverage its vast Commonwealth diaspora to its advantage in improving relations with these major players. Some one million Bangladeshis and their descendants live in Malaysia, with a further 900,000 in the UK, and large communities in South Africa, Singapore, and Canada.

These communities stand to offer far more than remittance payments. As India's Prime Minister Modi so well understands, 'living bridges' can prove to be some of the most robust links between countries. It is people-to-people links, interwoven communities, and personal experience, which often have the greatest impact on who countries choose to deal closely with. Britain's large Indian population is without question a large part of why post-Brexit Britain has tried so hard to improve its relationships in New Delhi. King Charles' recent visit to the Bangladeshi community in London shows how Bangladesh's diaspora populations can serve as a powerful and positive link between the state institutions of one country and the culture, values, and perspectives of another.

But this isn't just about strengthening old partnerships – it's about building new ones.

Building on Commonwealth ties – sporting, legal, historical, or otherwise – to deepen its ties with Africa could also open up vast economic opportunities for Bangladesh's booming economy. Nigeria is set to be home to some 400 million people by 2050, with a further 84.7 million in Kenya and many millions more across Commonwealth Africa. The streets of Lagos, Nairobi, and Accra are all thronged with young Africans keen to buy clothing for their backs, jute sacks for their farms, and rice for their bellies. Compatible legal and commercial practices mean that doing business with other Commonwealth countries is 21% cheaper on average. Bangladesh can help to meet Africa's growing demand – and benefit from reciprocal access to Africa's vast and untapped oil reserves, and the explosion of agricultural production on the continent.

Closer to home, the Commonwealth is one of the few places where the often-dysfunctional South Asian club can come together and talk. Off the cricket pitch, there are few international forums where India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka are all willing to sit together. While tensions and challenges dominate Saarc summit after Saarc summit, the Commonwealth's global outlook often forces South Asia's sparring states to unite around common causes and shared interests, whether they like it or not.

The recent and positive steps taken by Prime Minister Hasina and Prime Minister Modi on cross-border terrorism and on energy production provide an excellent blueprint. With issues like Indian Ocean piracy, export support for small businesses, and the fight against rising sea levels are so often the focus of discussions in the Commonwealth, Bangladesh will quickly find itself agreeing with its neighbours more readily than it otherwise might.

In a world dominated by would-be hegemons, the Commonwealth is an increasingly attractive safe harbour for countries which do not see themselves firmly in one camp or the other. There is great value in independence-minded countries banding together to support one another against the global giants. Improved economic, diplomatic, and military ties with Commonwealth partners across the globe will strengthen Bangladesh's hand in dealing with behemoths like the US, China, and the European Union. As any good businessman will tell you, relying too heavily on one client is always a risk – a strategy of portfolio diversification would be a sensible long-term investment.

Bangladesh stands to be a particular beneficiary of the Commonwealth's connective power, bringing it closer to its diaspora, to new markets, and to its regional partners. The Ganabhaban should set in motion a concerted policy for consistent Commonwealth engagement and put Commonwealth ties at the centre of its foreign-policy thinking.

53,Biman never fails to disappoint,"Biman – flamboyant, glamourous, carefree – seems to be flying high on the back of unbridled corruption, reckless nepotism, shameless mismanagement, and belligerent malpractices. It also seems to have become a magnet for the wayward and the corrupt, ensnaring them with endless possibilities of thriving on the common people's taxes and national resources.

Take, for instance, Biman's puzzling decision to send about a hundred officials to Saudi Arabia this year on a 37-day, fully-paid-for trip, at a tentative cost of about Tk 8-10 crore, to ""supervise"" hajj pilgrims and assist them. In what capacity these Biman officials are going remains a mystery, since the ""work"" that they are supposed to do involves tasks that are already carried out by others – carrying luggage, wheelchair management ticketing, cleaning aircraft, etc.

For instance, these officials (from the customer service directorate, marketing sales, engineering and material management directorate, and IT, among other departments) are supposed to help in carrying the luggage and Zamzam water bottles/containers to and from hotels. However, the president of Hajj Agencies Association of Bangladesh, M Shahadat Hossain Taslim, said to this daily that, under the Makkah Route Initiative, Saudi-appointed employees carry the pilgrims' luggage between the airport and their hotels, and they also carry Zamzam water containers.

Moreover, the national flag carrier already has a General Sales Agent (GSA) in Saudi Arabia and station offices in Jeddah, Madinah, and Makkah. Despite the hollow and puerile justifications given by Biman authorities, this entire programme looks like a leisure trip for the officials at a time when the country is facing perhaps the worst forex crunch of recent times, and in spite of the prime minister's straightforward directive to avoid unnecessary foreign trips. Interestingly, Muhammad Nizam Uddin Ahmed, a key accused in the recent question paper leak scandal during Biman recruitment, is also a part of the entourage.

Unfortunately, Biman's misadventures do not end here. On May 3, its board of directors in principle decided to procure 10 Airbus planes, including the two freighters, to expand its fleet. This decision has left some aviation experts baffled, since Biman is only using six percent of its current freight capacity. In 2022, Biman carried about 28,000 tonnes of freight in the cargo hold of the planes making international flights, against a capacity of 498,000 tonnes. There is another challenge: Biman's seasonal cargo transport demand is west-bound when it comes to exports, and in-bound cargo mostly comes in from countries in the eastern region, such as China, Japan, Hong Kong, etc.

Given the reality, how is Biman planning to ensure a two-way goods traffic during these flights? Or are they planning to run only one-way transportation? If that is the case, Biman should thoroughly revisit the plan, as this looks like a loss-making venture at best, and a new enterprise to plunder taxpayers' money at worst.

Coming to passenger flights, even here Biman is not utilising its 100 percent capacity. Last year, it carried nearly 2.06 million passengers on international flights, and had a concerning 700,000 seats vacant, which translates to an underutilised capacity of 24 percent. This inability to utilise existing capacity has been attributed to shortages of pilots and cabin crew members, and poor planning and management.

At the executional level, too, Biman seems to be struggling incessantly, putting passengers' lives at risk. As recently as on May 13 this year, a Biman flight coming in from Kuala Lumpur at the Dhaka airport got stuck at the end of the runway while taking a U-turn, resulting in flight operation suspension at the airport for about an hour and causing about six international flights to be delayed. Unsurprisingly, neither of the two captains flying the aircraft managed to register the incident in the air safety report, which could have been a deliberate attempt to hide the incident from official reporting channels.

What is even more alarming is that the Boeing 787 Biman aircraft, which dropped off the prime minister at Tokyo airport on April 25 during her recent visit to Japan, on its way back to Bangladesh had to navigate a ""minimum equipment list"" flight, as both its weather radar systems had stopped functioning. Imagine this happening during the flight to Japan, instead of the return leg. This could essentially have put the life of the head of our government at risk.

While it is true that accidents can happen and machines can malfunction at any time, the least we can do is learn from past experiences and make it a point to not repeat mistakes.

A similar incident occurred on April 19 this year, when a Riyadh-bound Biman flight carrying 347 passengers had to make a technical landing at Dhaka airport two and a half hours into the flight, as its weather radar system was not working. Now, coming back to the incident involving the aircraft that carried our prime minister to Tokyo: if, as Air Commodore Moazzem Hossain, director of engineering and material management at Biman, said, it was only a ""small problem"" and did not ""pose a safety hazard,"" why did the Riyadh-bound flight suffer the same problem?

Unfortunately, these incidents are only the tip of the iceberg. It is a well-known and generally accepted fact that Biman is a cesspool of corruption and mismanagement. It does not have the capacity to run like a professional, commercial airline – despite its officials drawing corporate-structure salaries – let alone creating its competitive edge in the global aviation industry. It is a blackhole that keeps devouring national resources and gives nothing back in return except scandals. The airline has zero accountability and no regard for any form of governance, compliance, or internal (or even external) control measures.

While it is understandable that Biman serves the financial interests of vested quarters, the only solution to its malady is privatisation. The sooner the policymakers and decision-makers come to terms with this fact, the better.

57,Govt keeps borrowing big amounts from BB,"The government has kept borrowing a hefty amount of funds from the Bangladesh Bank as commercial banks are unable to meet the financing requirement of the state because of the liquidity crunch.

Between July 1 and May 10 this fiscal year, the government borrowed Tk 67,906 crore from the central bank, BB data showed. It borrowed Tk 31,403 crore from the BB in the entire previous fiscal year.

""Borrowing from the central bank means an injection of money into the market,"" said Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh.

""It will put an adverse impact on inflation and the balance of payments (BoP).""

Owing to the fund injection, the volume of notes and coins in circulation is increasing. In Bangladesh, this money can multiply by as much as five times, according to a number of central bankers.

""So, the Tk 67,906 crore borrowed by the government may end up being Tk 339,530 crore. The extra money in the hands of people will create additional demand for goods, which, will in turn drive up prices,"" Mansur said.

Inflation fell slightly to 9.24 per cent in April after the Consumer Price Index jumped to a seven-month high of 9.33 per cent in March. It was 6.17 per cent in February last year.

The injection of a large amount of money will also bring about a negative impact for the BoP, said Mansur, also a former official of the International Monetary Fund.

If money circulation rises, the demand for goods and services goes up, which pushes up imports, he said.

The country has been facing a downward trend in foreign exchange reserves for the last several months as export and remittance earnings are failing to offset the surge in import bills, driven by the higher global commodity prices.

""An increase in imports means the reserves will face further pressure,"" Mansur said.

The reserves stood at $30.34 billion last week in contrast to $42.20 billion in May last year, a decrease of 28 per cent year-on-year.

The government took on Tk 10,654 crore in loans from commercial banks between July 1 and May 10, sending its overall borrowing from the banking source to Tk 78,560 crore. The borrowing target for FY23 is Tk 106,334 crore.

The borrowing is expected to go up in the last two months of the fiscal year as the government would have to raise expenditures in order to implement its development and revenue programmes.",2023-05-18 02:30:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/economy/news/govt-keeps-borrowing-big-amounts-bb-3323031,2023-05-18 10:19:16,thedailystar
58,Import of manmade fibre surges amid rising demand,"Imports of manmade fibre (MMF), such as polyester staple fibre (PSF) and viscose staple fibre (VSF), are surging in Bangladesh due to higher demand from local garment makers and exporters.

In 2022, local spinners imported 1.10 lakh tonnes of PSF at a cost of about Tk 1,243 crore. The year before, some 1.34 lakh tonnes of PSF were imported for around Tk 1,280 crore.

Between January and April of the current year, Bangladesh imported 30,653 tonnes of PSF worth roughly Tk 330 crore, according to data from the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA).

Similarly, the country imported 92,898 tonnes of VSF worth about Tk 1,734 crore last year, up from 73,230 tonnes for Tk 1,265 crore in 2021, the data shows.

In the first four months of 2023, a total of 48,431 tonnes of VSF worth Tk 931 crore were imported.

The BTMA suggests that MMF imports have risen as local garment makers are increasing the production of non-cotton garment items in a bid to get better prices and grab a bigger share of the global market for this segment.

Moreover, prices of MMF are lower than cotton, said Monsoor Ahmed, additional director of the BTMA, which is a platform for the primary textile sector.

The demand for clothing has increased a lot in line with the global supply chain's recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and so, the price of cotton has also gone up in international markets.

As a result, local manufacturers started increasing their MMF imports, he said, adding that MMF-based garment items fetch better prices than their cotton-based counterparts.

Ahmed also said the MMF sector has witnessed a surge in investment over the past three or four years because of the rise in demand from local garment suppliers.

For example, investment in the MMF sector currently stands at nearly $2.5 billion while it was nothing five years ago.

At present, there are six dedicated MMF textile mills in operation while others are waiting to begin production.

Faruque Hassan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), said local production of MMF-based yarn and fabrics has increased a lot over the last two years.

Currently, of the total annual apparel exports, some 24 per cent are MMF-based garment items, but the BGMEA aims to take this percentage to 40 per cent by the end of 2030.

""Exporting more MMF garments could help the industry recover from the falling trend of shipments in this bad time,"" Hassan said.

Besides, the BGMEA has already sought 10 per cent cash incentives on exports of MMF-based garment items to encourage shipments, he added.

Prices of MMF-based apparel is higher than cotton-made garment items. For instance, if a T-shirt made from cotton costs $5 per piece, the same item would be priced at nearly $10 if made from MMF.

Globally, the demand for MMF-based garments is higher, accounting for some 74 per cent of all clothing items sold worldwide.

So, local garment exporters are more inclined towards MMF-based garments as they look to grab a bigger market share of the segment's roughly $750 billion global market.

Local garment suppliers have been trying to export to new markets so that any kind of bad impact in traditional markets like the US and EU can be offset to an extent, Hassan said.

So, exporting more MMF-based garments would help a lot to this end, especially in Asian markets.

Globally, the demand for MMF-based apparel has been growing because of the changing trends of fashion and lifestyle.",2023-05-18 04:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/economy/news/import-manmade-fibre-surges-amid-rising-demand-3323026,2023-05-18 10:19:17,thedailystar
59,Baggage tax on gold likely to be same as import,"The National Board of Revenue (NBR) is planning to increase the amount of tax payable for gold brought in under baggage rules in order to encourage legal import of gold and use of legal channels for remittance transfers.

Sources in the NBR believe most of the gold being brought into the country in this manner were an intentional attempt at bypassing higher import taxes and at smuggling the gold to neighbouring countries.

Moreover, it was part of the hundi process, a cross-border money transfer method that bypasses the legal banking system.

Under the upcoming Baggage Rule-2023, a passenger will have to pay Tk 40,000 in tax for each gold bar (weighing approximately 116 grams), which is double that currently payable.

Under the existing law, a passenger can bring two gold bars (up to 234 grams). Anything extra is acceptable through the payment of a fine. The new rule would enable confiscation of anything extra or undeclared.

This change, to be proposed in the upcoming budget, is being made based on the recommendations of the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate (CIID) and customs officials concerned.

""Intelligence agencies found evidence that gangs are smuggling gold to neighbouring countriesusing the facility,"" a top NBR official told The Daily Star on condition of anonymity

""As a result, this law is to be implemented as soon as possible from next June-July,"" said the official.

The sources said all concerned, including the prime minister and finance minister, have provided policy support.

An NBR source said about 99,791 kilogrammes of gold bars worth Tk 87,500 crore were brought into the country through luggage in the last four years till 2022.

However, about 52 per cent, or at least 52,195 kg worth Tk 44,366 crore, was brought in 2022 alone.

The amount is also equal to three to four years' demand of the country, said the sources.

The government received about Tk 1,714 crore in duties from the gold in the last four years.

In 2018, the NBR allowed 18 companies to import gold but up until now only three have imported a nominal amount.

""Individuals bringing gold into the country under the baggage rules have to pay less in taxes than the ones importing gold for business,"" Mohammad Fakhrul Alam, director general of the CIID told The Daily Star.

""The smugglers are taking advantage of this facility…this is impacting our remittance inflow,"" he said.

""We sent some suggestions to the NBR to change the baggage rules. Besides, I have heard that some suggestions have been forwarded from other organisations and agencies. However, I still don't know what changes will be made, he added.

""The cost of importing gold is almost double that under the baggage rules. As a result, smugglers are using baggage rules to bring in gold,"" said Anwar Hossain, vice president of Bangladesh Jewellers' Association, told The Daily Star.

""Gold bars and jewellery worth around Tk 73,000 crore come to Bangladesh under baggage rules every year and most of this gold goes to neighbouring countries,"" he said.

60,Nagad Finance gets NBFI licence,"Bangladesh Bank yesterday issued a licence for Nagad Finance PLC to provide services as a non-bank financial institution (NBFI) in the country's financial sector.

Nagad Ltd, which currently operates the mobile financial service (MFS) window of the Bangladesh Post Office, also plans to roll out an MFS under the new NBFI.

The MFS will act as a subsidiary of Nagad Finance with 51 per cent of its shares to be held by the NBFI while the rest will be owned by existing directors of Nagad Ltd.

A central bank official said Nagad Finance would have to take prior approval from the BB to roll out the MFS.

Contacted, Tanvir A Mishuk, managing director of Nagad Ltd, said the new NBFI would begin its journey on July 1 this year. Mishuk will serve the NBFI as a director on its board.

He said the NBFI would mobilise deposits from underprivileged persons by rolling out different savings schemes.

For instance, people will be able to keep small-scale deposits on a daily basis at the NBFI, which will help to create the habit of saving among the masses.

Similarly, the NBFI will also disburse loans among people of the low-income group at a single-digit interest rate.",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/economy/news/nagad-finance-gets-nbfi-licence-3323011,2023-05-18 10:19:19,thedailystar
61,"LC opening for most commodities, machinery dips","Importers opened a lower volume of letters of credits (LCs) in July-April for the purchase of essential commodities such as rice, wheat, sugar, crude edible oil as well as raw materials and machinery key to the industrial sector, figures from the central bank showed.

On the other hand, the LC opening for pulses, spices, coal and petroleum products went up in the first 10 months of 2022-23, according to the monthly update of various economic indicators.

Overall, the opening and settlement of LCs fell 26.80 per cent and 8.15 per cent year-on-year in July-April owing to import controls enforced by the government and the central bank with a view to stopping the erosion of the foreign currency reserves.

Owing to higher commodity prices in the global market, the forex reserve has fallen by about 28 per cent in the past one year, sliding to $30.35 billion on May 10 from $41.95 billion on the same day last year.

BB data showed the LC opening stood at $56.36 billion in July-April, down from $76.99 billion from a year ago. The settlement fell to $62.39 billion from $67.93 billion.

Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, thinks the LC opening has dropped owing to both price adjustments and volume adjustments.

He explained that globally, commodity prices have fallen compared to the pre-war level. ""So, we are being able to purchase commodities at reduced costs. This is good for us. But the import might have fallen in terms of volume as well, which is not good for us.""

The former official of the International Monetary Fund says owing to the US dollar crisis, many businesses are not being able to import.

Central bank data showed that the opening of LCs for rice and wheat stood at $1.94 billion in July-April, down 14.38 per cent from a year ago. The settlement fell 11.21 per cent to $1.9 billion.

LCs worth $880 million were opened to procure sugar and salt from international markets, a decrease of 8.45 per cent from $961 million during the same period last year.

The settlement declined 17.19 per cent to $688 million.

Banks processed LCs amounting to $1.62 billion to help businesses buy refined edible oil in the first 10 months of FY23, an increase of 14.88 per cent from $1.41 billion a year earlier. The settlement surged nearly 50 per cent to $1.74 billion.

Syed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, said banks used to open LCs amounting to $7 billion to $8 billion a month in the past whereas it has come down to about $5 billion currently.

He, however, questioned whether Bangladesh would able to keep the imports at the current level since it is related to the economic growth, job creation and investments.

""Bangladesh is an import-dependent nation and we will have to ensure adequate imports to keep the wheels of the economy running.""

Overall, the opening of LCs for consumer goods fell 18.19 per cent to $6.68 billion. It was $4.49 billion for intermediate goods, a drop of 31.39 per cent.

The LC opening for industrial raw materials went down by 31.85 per cent to $19.22 billion.

The LC opening for textile fabrics declined 28.85 per cent to $7.76 billion. Similarly, importers opened 42.52 per cent lower LCs at $2.02 billion to buy raw cotton and 53.73 per cent lower at $1.39 billion for cotton yarn.

Importers opened LCs amounting to $2.45 billion for capital machinery, a fall of 56.91 per cent from a year earlier, according to the central bank's monthly report.

The LC opening and settlement for fruit imports fell 34.56 per cent and 35.90 per cent to $294.70 million and $251.40 million, respectively, between July and April.

Banks opened the instruments amounting to $288 million to help traders import pulses, which were 30.48 per cent higher than a year ago. LCs worth $278 million were opened for spices, up 25.19 per cent year-on-year, while it fell 35.28 per cent to $98.6 million for onion.

The LC opening for the import of petroleum and petroleum products rose 2.38 per cent to $7.63 billion in July-April, driven by a large increase for the purchase of refined items.

LCs valued at $3.91 billion were opened to buy refined petroleum products, up nearly 30 per cent from a year ago. The settlement surged 58.87 per cent to $4.2 billion.

The opening of LCs for bringing in capital machinery for textile, leather, jute, garment, pharmaceuticals and packaging industries fell between 40 per cent and 70 per cent.

The LC opening for crude edible oil dropped 12.06 per cent to $388 million. Traders opened 30.48 per cent higher LCs for pulses at $288 million.

Rahman thinks there is no alternative to bringing the financial account of the balance of payments to the positive territory by the way of accelerating export and remittance earnings and attracting foreign portfolio investments and foreign direct investments.

The financial account covers claims or liabilities to non-residents concerning financial assets. Between July and March of 2022-23, the financial account registered a deficit of $2.21 billion in contrast to a surplus of $11.92 billion a year ago.

Historically the financial account of Bangladesh has experienced a surplus almost every year.

""There is no other way but to increase the supply of US dollars,"" Mansur said.

""We are getting some dollars from development partners. But the volume is not adequate. So, we will have to go for the floating exchange rate to improve the supply situation of the American greenback.""",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/economy/news/lc-opening-most-commodities-machinery-dips-3323006,2023-05-18 10:19:20,thedailystar

63,Why National Tea’s share price plunged 60%?,"The National Tea Company had a surprise for many stock traders yesterday as the company's share price plunged by a whopping 59.89 per cent.

The stock price of the state-run listed company dropped to Tk 251 yesterday though it was traded at Tk 626 on May 14.

Issuance of new ordinary shares and price adjustment followed by it actually caused the fall, according to the stock brokers.

The company will issue 2.34 crore ordinary shares of Tk 10 each at an issue price of Tk 119.53 each, including a premium of Tk 109.53, for which it received regulatory approval in April this year.

The adjustment was needed as the company was issuing ordinary shares to its existing 66 lakh shareholders to raise a paid-up capital of Tk 279.7 crore.

On May 15, the trading of National Tea's share remained suspended as it was the record date, which is the cut-off date established by a company in order to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive shares or a dividend.

However, National Tea's trading remained halted on May 16 also as the price adjustment was not complete.

Finally, the share price dropped after the completion of the price adjustment.

The purpose of issuance of placement share was to support the business growth (field and factory development), finance the working capital needs along with repayment of bank loan.

Of the 2.34 crore shares, 1.24 crore shares to be issued to the government, Investment Corporation of Bangladesh and Sadharan Bima Corporation.

65,Euro zone inflation ticks up in April,"Euro zone inflation accelerated last month, Eurostat said on Wednesday, confirming preliminary data pointing to increasingly stubborn price growth among the 20 nations sharing the euro.

Overall price growth accelerated to 7.0 per cent in April from 6.9 per cent a month earlier, as rising services and energy costs offset a slowdown in food price growth.

Although underlying price growth, the key focus of European Central Bank policymakers in recent months, slowed a touch, the crucial services component continued to accelerate, pointing to mounting wage pressures that could get inflation stuck above the ECB's 2 per cent target.

Excluding volatile food and fuel prices, core inflation slowed to 7.3 per cent from 7.5 per cent, while an even narrower measure, which excludes alcohol and tobacco, slowed to 5.6 per cent from 5.7 per cent in its first decline since last June.

Inflation has been above the ECB's 2 per cent target for nearly two years and the bank has lifted interest rates by a combined 375 basis points since last July to arrest runaway price growth.

But more hikes are likely as it could be 2025 before inflation is back at target and the ""last mile"" of disinflation, getting from 3 per cent to 2 per cent, could be especially difficult, taking nearly 2 years.",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/global-economy/news/euro-zone-inflation-ticks-april-3322986,2023-05-18 10:19:25,thedailystar

The United Arab Emirates will continue its cooperation with Bangladesh in the development of its infrastructure and sea ports for mutual benefits.

Abdulla Ali AlHmoudi, UAE's newly appointed ambassador to Bangladesh, said this during a courtesy call on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the Gono Bhaban today.

Prime Minister's Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim briefed reporters after the meeting.

The UAE envoy said his county will carry forward the friendship and cooperation with Bangladesh for economic development.

Ali AlHmoudi apprised the prime minister about his meeting with Bangladesh's state minister of civil aviation and tourism regarding the cooperation in the aviation sector.

The ambassador recalled that the foundation of the bilateral relation between Bangladesh and the UAE was laid by fathers of the two nations, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, through a visit to the Gulf nation by Bangabandhu in 1974.

Later, Sheikh Nahyan also visited Dhaka in 1984 and played a very pivotal role in establishing solid foundation of the bilateral ties between the two brotherly countries, he added.

71,Legal notice served against Wizz Air Abu Dhabi,"CAAB, other authorities asked not to grant permission to the airline claiming it will harm local airlines

Bangladesh Jubo Orthonitibid Forum (Bangladesh Youth Economist Forum) today served a legal notice to the Civil Aviation Ministry, Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) and Biman Bangladesh Airlines asking them not to give permission to Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, a low-cost airline to operate flights on Dhaka-Abu Dhabi route.

Mosharrof Hossain Kajol, a Supreme Court lawyer served the notice on behalf of Youth Economist Forum saying the country's two airlines -- Biman and US-Bangla -- will be severely affected if CAAB gives permission to the ultra-low-cost carrier Wizz Air going against the interest of the country.

In the notice, it was said that although there is an obligation to take permission from the respective ministry before giving such permission to operate flight, CAAB didn't take any such permission. It also didn't discuss with any local airlines of the country.

In the notice, it was also said that before giving permission to such an ultra-low-cost carrier, the government should give priority to local airlines.

CAAB is likely to give approval to Wizz Air Abu Dhabi to operate flights on Dhaka-Abu Dhabi route.

Wizz Air is originally a Hungarian multinational ultra-low-cost carrier with its head office in Budapest, Hungary.

It was founded in 2019 as Wizz Air's UAE subsidiary.

Meanwhile, two-day discussions on a bilateral aviation agreement between Bangladesh and UAE started in Dhaka yesterday.

In the meeting, the issues of increasing communication under the existing aviation agreement between the two countries and making the agreement more up-to-date and enhancing mutual cooperation were discussed.

Senior officials of UAE Civil Aviation Authority and Dubai, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah Civil Aviation Authority and a total of 22 representatives of various airlines of the UAE were present at the meeting held at the headquarter of CAAB.

73,Dhaka-Cox’s Bazar Rail Link: Opening this Sept but bottlenecks to stay till 2028,"Rickety Kalurghat bridge, poor state of Ctg to Dohazari line to trouble travellers

The Dhaka-Cox's Bazar rail line via Chattogram is likely to open this September, but the rail connectivity between the capital and the tourist district may not be smooth before 2028.

Officials said the dilapidated Kalurghat bridge and the poor state of a 52km section from Chattogram city to Dohazari are the problems.

Bangladesh Railway is to take up two projects -- one for building a new bridge at Kalurghat, and the other for improving the Chattogram-Dohazari section. But projects would not be completed before 2028, BR sources said.

Currently, the bridge, with a speed limit of just 10kmph, is off-limits for heavy locomotives and trains.

Until the new bridge is built there, BR is planning to spend Tk 60 crore to repair the current one and make it sturdy enough for heavy locomotives. However, the repairs will not allow trains' speed limit on the bridge to be raised much.

There is a fault or weakness in the planning. And that's why the Dhaka-Cox's Bazar rail operation will not be smooth until the new bridge is built and the section [Chattogram-Dohazari] is improved. — transport expert Prof Hadiuzzaman

The Chattogram-Dohazari section is a meter-gauge line with a speed limit of 48kmph, a stark contrast to the 100km rail line from Dohazari to Cox's Bazar's Ramu with a 100kmph speed limit.

Speaking to The Daily Star yesterday, transport expert Prof Hadiuzzaman said, ""There is a fault or weakness in the planning. And that's why the Dhaka-Cox's Bazar rail operation will not be smooth until the new bridge is built and the section [Chattogram-Dohazari] is improved.""

Speed limits -- on the bridge and the section mentioned -- will hamper the effectiveness of operations on the line, said Hadiuzzaman, a professor of the civil engineering department at Buet

Referring to the rail speed limit imposed on the Bangabandhu Bridge, he said, ""We didn't learn any lesson from that experience.""

The 20kmph speed limit on Bangabandhu Bridge has been causing delays in rail operations from Dhaka to northern and south-western parts of the country.

CHATTOGRAM-COX'S BAZAR RAIL LINE

The government took up the 128km metre-gauge rail line project in 2010, with a target to complete by June 2013. It was supposed to cost Tk 1,852.35 crore.

In 2014, the government decided to install dual-gauge lines and keep space for double lines, which raised the cost to a staggering Tk 18,034.47 crore.

The authorities then made more changes and shelved the plan to build the lines up to Ramu's Gundum, near the Myanmar border.

But the physical work of the 100km Dohazari-Ramu section started in March 2018, with a current deadline set for June 2024, with a one-year defect liability period.

Visiting the project site yesterday, Railways Minister Nurul Islam Sujan said the Dhaka-Cox's Bazar rail operation will begin within this September.

""All-out efforts are on to complete the work [of Chattogram-Cox's Bazar line] within August to inaugurate it [Dhaka-Cox's Bazar line] in September,"" he told reporters while inspecting the under-construction iconic station in Cox's Bazar.

At least 84 percent of the civil works have been completed, he added.

THE IMPEDIMENTS

Built in 1931 as a rail bridge and then converted into a rail/road bridge in 1962, the Kalurghat bridge over the Karnaphuli has become rather unsafe and the authorities have to repair it occasionally to keep it usable.

Heavy locomotives, which were added to the railway fleet over the last few years, cannot use the bridge.

In 2014, the government decided to build a new bridge and decommission the British-era bridge.

In 2018, a Detailed Project Proposal (DPP) was prepared for a single rail line and double-lane road bridge that would cost Tk 1,163.27 crore.

Now, the bridge would have double-line dual-gauge rail lines and a double-lane road on the same deck. It is expected to be built at a cost of around Tk 14,000 crore with South Korean financing.

BR is expected to submit the new DPP within this month and the project is likely to take up to 2028 to be completed.

Railways Minister Sujan said a group of experts were tasked with repairing the bridge and once that is done, the railway operations will face no hindrance.

A BR official, requesting anonymity, said the repaired bridge will be able to support heavy locomotives, but the speed limit will remain the same. ""It can be upgraded to maybe 20kmph but no more than that.""

BR has already floated tender to repair the bridge before September 15, sources said.

Meanwhile, only two passenger trains and an oil tanker train, both pulled by small locomotives, run on the Chattogram-Dohazari metre-gauge section, BR sources said.

To increase the speed on the section to 80kmph from 48kmph, BR has submitted a project proposal to the Planning Commission. The proposal asked to turn the section into dual-gauge one at a cost of Tk 7,073.54 crore by June 2027 with funding from Asian Development Bank.

Contacted, BR's Director General Quamrul Ahsan, however, claimed that railway operations between Dhaka and Cox's Bazar will be smooth from the beginning of its opening.

He said they would carry out some maintenance work on the Chattogram-Dohazari section to increase train speed to 60kmph, claiming that after repairs, the speed limit on Kalurghat Bridge would also be increased. He, however, could not say by how much.

74,Sara Ali Khan makes Cannes debut with stunning lehenga,"The 76th Cannes Film Festival has officially commenced, and promising Bollywood actresses are debuting on the Cannes red carpet for the first time. While Esha and Manushi Chillar opted for gowns, Sara Ali Khan gave a deshi spin to her look by wearing a gorgeous lehenga at the Cannes.

Sara played muse to fashion designer Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla for her Cannes red carpet debut, selecting a gorgeous lehenga from the designer's collection. Sara chose a traditional look for Cannes and embraced her ethnic side, which Dolly Jain draped. The actress wore a pastel blouse with silver embroidery and a plunging neckline.

She paired it with a long and flowy skirt with ethnic designs in shades of white throughout. Sara finished her outfit with a matching dupatta on her shoulders connected to her hair bun, including white embellishments and tulle around the borders. ""You Cannes do it,"" Sara wrote in her Instagram post.

Sara wore minimal makeup and let her ethnic attire speak for itself. Sara looked stunning in nude eyeshadow, black eyeliner, black kohl, mascara-laden eyelashes, contoured cheeks, and a touch of nude lipstick at this year's Cannes Film Festival.

75,‘Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway’: A mother’s fight for justice,"The Rani Mukerji starrer, ""Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway"" is a heart wrenching tale of an Indian immigrant who struggles for the custody of her own children, when they are placed in foster care by Norwegian childcare services. Based on a true event, the film follows the life of Debika Chatterjee, drawing inspiration from the real-life story of Sagarika Chakraborty, an Indian woman whose children were forcefully taken away by the Norwegian authorities.

The film opens with Debika frantically chasing a car as three women forcefully take her children away. The car speeds away with her five-month-old baby, whom she breastfeeds, and her son, who attends a neighbourhood kindergarten and is suspected to have autism. Her desperation builds as she realises her husband Anirudh may be pursuing the legal struggle to reconnect with their children just half-heartedly because he is more focused with obtaining citizenship. All this results in Debika's strong obsession with regaining custody of her children.

Video of Mrs. Chatterjee vs Norway | Official Trailer | Rani Mukerji | Netflix India

While narrating the age-old custody fight, the film highlights the various difficulties that immigrants face. Debika's predicament reveals a lack of cultural awareness, inclusion, and empathy when authorities protest her parenting methods such as hand-feeding her children and sharing the same bed. The issues are severed to the point that the foster care workers label Debika to be mentally unfit, who would be unable to take care of the children as they proceed to become wards of the state. It brings out a number of problems, like how the foster system forces immigrant children to blend into Norwegian culture, or how foster parents are involved in a corrupt system where everyone makes money by trading children.

Apart from being aggressive, the main complaint levelled against the Chatterjee household is the fact that Anirudh Chatterjee does not help his wife in household tasks. Instead of allowing viewers to explore the complexities of an ordinary household, the film states everything out loudly. As a result, the picture foregoes the intricacies and nuances necessary to develop a connection with the audience. Anirudh's character has been left unidimensional in order to establish him as an unfeeling husband eager to accomplish his selfish aims. While doing so, it also highlights the harsh reality of the patriarchal system surrounding our lives.

At its core, this is the story of an ordinary immigrant woman who goes to extraordinary lengths to get custody of her children. This high-voltage drama, powered by Rani Mukerji, is about a mother's undying love for her children. The director, Ashima Chibber, skims over several true points about patriarchy, domestic violence, and what it means to be a good mother. She does not whitewash her problematic protagonist, but the execution only touches the surface. The makers set out to tell a very important story, and it manages to send viewers into a frenzy of emotions. What it lacks is the depth associated with handling such a sensitive issue. They try to make up for this by replacing cinematic complexions with familial drama, but the absence is felt thoroughly during the first half.

With a quality actor like Rani Mukerji on board, the director could have effortlessly shaped her into a far more complicated character than we get to watch. The actress, who has the ability to be natural on camera, goes beyond and dramatic. Her raucous struggle for justice fills the first half with more noise and less pain. However, she nails the tone of her character in the second half, where her silence allows viewers to think and feel more freely. Rani gradually transforms into the aggrieved mother and is effective once she allows her eyes to say volumes. Her portrayal of a mother fighting for her child has been critically acclaimed, with people calling it one of the best performances of her career. She eats doodh-bhat-kola, the ultimate Bengali comfort food, wears exquisite jamdani sarees over trench coats, and constantly slips into Bangla mid-conversation. It almost looks like a peek into her everyday life, where a typical mother centres her life around her children.

Another character worth mentioning has to be Jim Sarbh. He elevates and gives the film its best moments. His understated performance of an Indian-origin lawyer in Norway captures the entire essence of the film. When his character criticises the concept that adoptive parents cannot be as loving and caring as biological parents, Sarbh makes viewers think, and they crave for more screen time with his arguments at the climax.

With a story this emotive, the film needed less theatrics and more thoughtful periods. Still, it manages to present a narrative that has to be shared in order to remind us of the strength of a strong-willed mother. It provides a closer look into the anguish of a mother, who is forced to run from one court to another in order to reunite with her own children. It makes one think of the strength of a mother, and the extent she can go to protect the rights of her children.

Another noteworthy character is Jim Sarbh, who delivers a standout performance in the film. His understated portrayal of an Indian-origin lawyer in Norway captures the essence of the film. When his character challenges the notion that adoptive parents cannot be as loving and caring as biological parents, Sarbh prompts viewers to contemplate, leaving them yearning for more of his screen time and arguments during the climax.

With such an emotionally charged story, the film could have benefitted from fewer theatrics and more contemplative moments. Nonetheless, it successfully presents a narrative that deserves to be shared, serving as a reminder of the strength and determination of a mother. It offers a closer examination of the anguish experienced by a mother who is compelled to navigate from one court to another in her quest to reunite with her own children. It provokes thoughts on the unwavering power of a mother and the lengths she will go to protect the rights of her children.",2023-05-14 09:07:29,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/mrs-chatterjee-vs-norway-mothers-fight-justice-3319681,2023-05-18 10:19:33,thedailystar
76,'Our plan was to provide opportunities',"The Bangladesh Under-19 team lost the lone T20 against their Pakistani counterparts by four wickets at the Shahid Kamruzzaman Stadium in Rajshahi yesterday.

Pakistan chased the target of 160 runs posted by Bangladesh losing six wickets and five balls to spare where opener Shamyl Hossain top scored with 67 off 49 balls striking seven fours and a six.

The triumph completed a successful tour for the visitors, who won the lone youth Test and also clinched the five-match one-day series 4-1.

Bangladesh's batting was the biggest area of concern, with the young Tigers unable to post over 200 runs in any of the five one-dayers against Pakistan.

The only time Bangladesh managed to score over 200 on the entire tour was in the second innings of the lone youth Test, although that did not avert a comprehensive 10-wicket defeat.

According to age-level selector Hannan Sarkar, the home series against Pakistan was part of an experimental process aimed to provide opportunities and test team's bench strength ahead of the ICC Under-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka next year.

""The boys did well in Pakistan and also managed to win the tri-nation series in the UAE featuring Sri Lanka and Afghanistan recently. Our plan was to provide opportunities to other players in the squad for our next home series. Six cricketers made their debut against Pakistan in this series,"" Hannan told The Daily Star.

""We needed to prepare back-up players with injuries and other issues in mind ahead of the World Cup. Maybe we had a tough time against Pakistan, but we are not concerned about the results. This was part of an experimental process with our long-term goal, which is the World Cup next year, in mind.""

The young Tigers will host South Africa in July for a five-match one-day series and the board is also planning to play a tri-nation series before the Asia Cup later this year.",2023-05-18 03:41:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/cricket/news/our-plan-was-provide-opportunities-3323106,2023-05-18 10:19:34,thedailystar
77,Which strengths to focus on for next Afghanistan Test?,"The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced the itinerary for Afghanistan's tour of Bangladesh in two phases, with the visitors set to arrive on June 10 for the one-off Test in Mirpur.

The Tigers do not have happy memories of hosting Afghanistan in lone Tests. Afghanistan had won by a mammoth 224 runs the maiden Test between the two countries in Chattogram as Bangladesh's plans backfired.

On a surface with turn for spinners, Afghanistan had one pacer while Bangladesh's only pace-bowling option was Soumya Sarkar. But despite Bangladesh's deep batting line-up, the Afghan spinners had more effect on how the match was played than their counterparts.

This time, the lone Test will be in Mirpur from June 14 before Afghanistan depart on June 19 for their series against India during the Eid-ul-Adha break. Afghanistan will return again on July 1 to play three ODIs on July 5,8 and 11 respectively before playing two T20Is in Sylhet on July 14 and 16.

After that lone Test in 2019, lots of discussions revolved around why captain Shakib Al Hasan had preferred a spinning track. ""First thing to ask is where are the pacers? We played on sporting wickets at the World Cup. Why the reversal in plans? I have to know who came up with these plans first,"" BCB boss Nazmul Hassan Papon had said back then.

""I thought we were going to play on a sporting wicket,"" he had also stated.

Will there be a shift in tactics knowing that Afghanistan's spinners are a force to reckon with, especially considering that Bangladesh's strength now lies in their pace department?

On a spinning track, Afghanistan's spinners are expected to do better than Bangladesh's. But if the Test against Ireland last month in Mirpur is anything to go by, Bangladesh's pace attack did not have much to enjoy from the surface although the Tigers opted for a best-of-both-worlds policy with three pacers and three spinners.

This time, the Tigers will likely have to do without skipper Shakib Al Hasan. He injured his right index finger during the Ireland series and will take six weeks to heal. ""Yes, chances of Shakib being there are low. Not having him is definitely a big setback, but there's not much to do if he can't play,"" selector Habibul Bashar said.

The Tigers had shown ambition with their selection, picking pacers Ebadot Hossain, Khaled Ahmed and Shoriful Islam for the Ireland Test. Chandika Hathurusingha will have his own process heading into the Test and Bashar believes that in time, their plans will be activated.

""We haven't gone according to a plan since there is a lot of time left before the Test. We do have some plans but it's not something to be shared,"" Bashar remarked.

The team management will however be hopeful that results are not as disastrous in terms of their own planning this time around.

78,Bielsa says Uruguay can dream of return to greatness,"Argentine Marcelo Bielsa (L) speaks next to the president of the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF), Ignacio Alonso, during his presentation as coach of the Uruguayan national football team, at the Centenario Stadium in Montevideo, on May 17, 2023.

Uruguay have sufficient quality to allows them to dream of success, iconic new coach Marcelo Bielsa said on Wednesday as he was officially presented to the press.

Known as ""El Loco"" (the madman), the 67-year-old is widely considered as one of football's most influential coaches, even though his trophy cabinet is relatively bare compared to other greats of the game, such as Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti or Jose Mourinho.

Bielsa's long-expected signature had created great excitement in Uruguay over the past month, following an underwhelming group stage exit at last year's World Cup in Qatar, after which Diego Alonso did not renew his contract.

But despite the international retirements of star attacking duo Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani, Bielsa is convinced the current crop of players from the tiny South American country of just 3.5 million people can bring back the glory years.

Uruguay fans can feed their dreams of glory on the basis of their ""top level players,"" he told reporters at the Centenario stadium in central Montevideo.

Bielsa claimed he turned down much more lucrative offers from club sides to take over the reins at the two-time World Cup winners, whose last global triumph was in 1950.

""One of the main things that I took into account was that no club would have been able to offer me a group of players like those that Uruguay have right now,"" he said.

The new generation of stars includes Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde, forward Darwin Nunez of Liverpool and Barcelona centre-back Ronald Araujo.

Despite his lofty standing in the game, three Argentine titles with Newell's Old Boys (two) and Velez Sarsfield, Olympic gold with Argentina's under-23 side and a Championship crown with Leeds United are his only trophies.

Yet Guardiola himself has described Bielsa as ""the best coach in the world.""

""I've never coached one of the 20 biggest clubs in the world and they've never approached me,"" explained Bielsa.

""I'm not one of the greats.""

Acrimonious departures

Bielsa pointed to Uruguay's record under iconic veteran coach Oscar Tabarez, who won the 2011 Copa America a year after reaching the World Cup semi-finals, as superior to his achievements with Argentina and Chile.

But Bielsa's high-tempo attacking style has always proved a hit with fans.

He has signed a contract through to the end of the qualification campaign for the 2026 World Cup, which will be automatically extended to include the tournament if Uruguay qualify.

His first matches in charge will be a pair of friendlies against Nicaragua and Cuba in June before taking on his former employers Chile in Uruguay's opening World Cup qualifier in September.

Born into a bourgeois family in Rosario, the home town of Lionel Messi, Bielsa had a short playing career as a centre-back before retiring at just 25 to take up coaching.

After success with Newell's and Velez, he took over the national team reins in 1998.

In 2004 he guided Argentina to the Copa America final and won the Olympic Games with the under-23 outfit, which included Carlos Tevez, Javier Mascherano and Gabriel Heinze.

From there he had a successful stint at Athletic Bilbao, guiding the Basques to the Spanish Cup and Europa League finals in 2012, even beating Alex Ferguson's Manchester United home and away in Europe.

After that he made more of a name for himself for his acrimonious departures following highly public disagreements with the hierarchies at his clubs.

He left Marseille one game into his second season, spent just two days in charge of Lazio and lasted only 14 matches with Lille.",2023-05-18 02:32:42,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/bielsa-says-uruguay-can-dream-return-greatness-3323091,2023-05-18 10:19:35,thedailystar
79,Bangladesh 2nd in South Asia in bad loan ratio,"Bangladesh's banking sector has the second-highest ratio of non-performing loans (NPL) among the countries in South Asia as lenders continue to face multiple challenges emanating from scams, a lack of corporate governance and borrowers' growing reluctance to make instalments regularly.

Only Sri Lanka is ahead of Bangladesh.

And in the case of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), the ratio of NPL is the highest in Bangladesh, with Sri Lanka coming second, according to a World Bank report, which was released recently.

The report styled ""Expanding Opportunities: Toward Inclusive Growth"" said the latest NPL ratios remain below the 2021 levels and the 10 per cent threshold commonly used to indicate systemic stress in most South Asian countries.

Exceptions are Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, where the NPL ratio reached above the 2021 level: it was 9.4 per cent in Bangladesh and 10.9 per cent in Sri Lanka in September 2022.

""Asset quality has deteriorated in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,"" said the report.

The report comes at a time when defaulted loans resulting from factors, namely scams and a lack of corporate governance, continue to be a drag on the banking sector.

As of December 2022, the default loans at banks of Bangladesh increased 16.8 per cent year-on-year to Tk 120,656 crore as habitual defaulters showed reluctance to repay the funds.

The ratio accounted for 8.16 per cent of the outstanding loans given out by banks as of December, up from 7.93 per cent a year ago, according to data from the Bangladesh Bank.

The WB said: ""In Bangladesh, the NPL ratio has risen due to higher import costs, poor payment discipline of borrowers, and weak regulatory enforcement. The resumption of lax loan rescheduling and asset classification in mid-2022 has delayed the full recognition of distressed assets.""

The NPL ratios among NBFIs are even higher than in the banking sector, reaching over 23 per cent in Bangladesh in June 2022 and 17 per cent in Sri Lanka in September 2022, according to the report.

Bhutan has the third-highest NPL ratio in South Asia, followed by Pakistan, the Maldives and India. Nepal has the lowest amount of NPL.

The WB said countries in South Asia with latent non-performing loans following forbearance measures during the Covid-19 pandemic are more vulnerable to spillovers from volatile global financial markets.

""Loan moratorium programmes during the pandemic have delayed the recognition of distressed assets.""

According to the report, distressed loans are concentrated in the sectors that have recovered more slowly or were hit by adverse shocks.

In India, while most of the pandemic-era loan moratoria have expired, some are still active and are being gradually phased out. As a result, distressed loans that were previously in the moratorium programmes are just starting to be recognised.

For example, the report said, around 16 per cent of the total number of loans under India's Emergency Credit Guarantee Scheme, which provided full credit guarantees to micro, small and medium enterprises, was reported as NPLs in September 2022.

In Pakistan, the microfinance sector was hit hard by the inflationary shock and losses due to the floods, with an estimated 18 lakh borrowers from areas affected by the floods in 2022.

Accordingly, the NPL ratio in the country's microfinance sector rose in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 2021.

In the case of private sector credit, the growth has accelerated in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and India, with the highest being observed in the services sector of India.

In Bangladesh, private credit grew in the fourth quarter of 2022 at a similar rate of the third quarter and faster than a year ago, as borrowers took advantage of a lending rate cap and concessionary financing by the central bank, said the WB.

The report also highlighted deposits at banks.

It said the deposit growth has declined in most countries and continues to fall behind credit growth.

In Bangladesh and Bhutan, the average deposit growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 fell below the levels in the previous quarter and in 2021.

""High inflation tends to reduce the deposit growth by lowering savings and reducing real deposit rates. A slowdown in remittance growth, which provides an important source of deposits for Bangladesh, has contributed to slow deposit growth,"" the report said.",2023-05-13 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/economy/news/bangladesh-2nd-south-asia-bad-loan-ratio-3319251,2023-05-18 10:19:36,thedailystar
80,Colonial laws still being used to muzzle voices,"Speakers tell roundtable

Speakers at a roundtable on “Sedition Law and Press Freedom in Bangladesh”, organised by the Law Desk of The Daily Star at the capital’s The Daily Star Centre yesterday. Photo: Star

Though the country's constitution guarantees freedom of press and expression, some British-era and post-independence acts, which had a colonial legacy, are still being used to control public, said speakers at a roundtable yesterday.

The Sedition section of the 1860 penal code, the Official Secrets Act of 1823 and the Digital Security Act (DSA) are examples of such legislations. It is time to challenge the sedition law, which has already been an issue in India and Pakistan due to its direct contradiction with their respective constitutions.

The roundtable, titled ""Sedition Law and Press Freedom in Bangladesh"", was organised by the Law Desk of this newspaper at The Daily Star Centre.

Section 124A of The Penal Code 1860 mentioned that anyone who by spoken or written words, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the lawful government, can be accused of committing sedition.

""Though this particular law is not being used by the government as a tool of oppression, the existence of the law itself is like a sword hanging in the balance... It encouraged [the government] in many ways to enact new laws like the Digital Security Act,"" said Barrister Tanjib-ul Alam.

He said the courts in Bangladesh always seek examples of neighbouring countries which had inherited the British-era penal code. However, the Indian Supreme Court suspended all the pending cases under the sedition law and the Indian government is currently reviewing it.

In Pakistan, the Lahore High Court has already termed the law unconstitutional and the final verdict is pending with its Supreme Court, he said.

About the DSA, he said, ""The act became a weapon to muzzle the protesting voice.""

Barrister Jyotirmoy Barua said the government does not need any law to put someone in jail, the will of the government high-ups is enough to do so.

He said the sedition act was first implemented by the British to suppress the Swadeshi movement.

""We have achieved our independence after sacrificing numerous lives. Therefore, we should have a different attitude from the British and Pakistan rulers. But when the state assimilated these oppressive laws, it lost its spirit of independence. Interestingly, some acts enacted after the Liberation War, such as the Special Powers Act of 1974 and DSA 2018, are even more oppressive,"" he added.

Prof Tanzimuddin Khan of Dhaka University's international relations department said DSA is a result of a colonial mindset.

Tanzim also said the DSA did not result in reduction of cybercrime, hacking, stalking or digital theft. ""It only muzzles independent voices. We should act politically against such laws and change the whole structure.""

ZI Khan Panna, chairperson of Ain o Salish Kendra, said all kinds of oppressive laws should be repealed.

""The spirit of our Liberation War was to build a repression-free society. But if we keep enacting such repressive acts, that would go against this spirit,"" he said.

Panna mentioned that around 30 percent of the DSA cases were filed against journalists. However, the larger share of the accused consists of people and minorities.

""We need to speak up against such laws and protest this situation,"" he added.

Faruq Faisel, regional director of the South Asian chapter of rights organisation Article 19, said the British-era laws were abusive and restrictive of freedom. ""These laws do not have any value in an independent country. But we have been carrying them over. It is time to discuss renewing and amending these laws.""

""Article 39 of the constitution also restricted criticism about the relations with any friendly foreign states. It is also a violation of the right to freedom of speech and expression for anyone who wants to say something for the country's betterment. Democracy is impossible without free media. No government can hold fair elections without ensuring press freedom,"" Faruq added.

Zillur Rahman, executive director of Centre for Governance Studies, said there are no laws regarding the extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearance, that occur in the country often.

Prof SM Shameem Reza of the mass communication and journalism department at Dhaka University said laws like the Sedition Act or Article 39 of the constitution allow the state to form other laws like Digital Security Act.

He suggested incorporating the issue of freedom of expression in textbooks and the educational curriculum as well.

In the keynote presentation, Emraan Azad, in charge of the Law Desk at The Daily Star, said section 295A of the Penal Code was incorporated in section 28 of the DSA.

""The clause has criminalised hurting religious sentiments through the publication and broadcasting of information online or in any other platforms. However, the terms have remained vague under this provision,"" said Emraan.

81,Trees felled flouting rules,"DSCC did not take necessary permission to cut trees, say forest department sources

The lush greenery of Dhaka is slowly disappearing, and in some instances the perpetrator behind this devastation is none other than the Dhaka South City Corporation.

DSCC's tree-felling frenzy is not just environmentally disastrous it's also illegal under existing provisions, as the city authority has been cutting trees without obtaining the necessary permission from the Forest Department, according to the department sources.

The Forest Department can file a lawsuit against the city corporation for this infraction, confirmed inside sources there, but whether they will exercise their power is another matter entirely.

Meanwhile, environmentalists have said it's time to hold DSCC accountable for their reckless actions and protect the green lungs of the city before it's too late.

Trees are being cut in the name of infrastructural development and beautification works at Saat Masjid Road in Dhanmondi, despite the fact that permission must be obtained from the Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) under Section 5 of the Forest Product Transit Rules-2011.

Md Saidul Islam, the divisional forest officer of Dhaka Social Forestry, said he cannot recall whether the DSCC sought permission or not. ""As per the rules, it is mandatory to seek permission from our department before cutting any trees,"" he added.

However, a Forest Department official, who wished to remain anonymous, said they never received any application from the city corporation for cutting the trees on Saat Masjid Road. The official also said the Forest Department could sue any individual or agency for violating the rule.

Dhaka has lost 56 percent of its green coverage over the last three decades, according to a study conducted by Jahangirnagar University's Department of Environmental Sciences last year. This is a cause for concern, particularly in light of recent record-high temperatures. The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) recommends that a city must have 25 percent of green coverage out of its total area.

Syeda Rizwana Hasan, the chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela), said, ""In urban planning, it is not mandatory to put the divider in the middle of the road. They are doing it on the pretext of beautification or facilitating vehicular movement. However, it serves no such purpose.""

""Public interest and people's expectations must be prioritised in projects that are implemented with public money,"" added Rizwana.

Prof Kamruzzaman Mojumder, the chairman of the Department of Environmental Sciences at Stamford University, warned of the huge impact of global warming on cities across the world. ""If the authority partakes in activities that shrink a city's green coverage, the temperature will further go up, which will be too tough to cope with. Dhaka is susceptible to such conditions where life and nature will have to bear the brunt of the rising temperature following depletion of green space,"" he added.

Marina Nazneen, the zonal executive officer (zone-1) of DSCC, claimed that there was a risk of accidents, which is why the trees were felled.

""The median strip will now be expanded and strengthened. The trees that have been cut have little to do with the environment,"" she said.

When asked about acquiring the Forest Department's approval, she said, ""This work does not require the permission of the Forest Department or the Department of Environment.""

She did not elaborate further.",2023-05-09 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/trees-felled-flouting-rules-3315856,2023-05-18 10:19:39,thedailystar
82,Extreme heat hampering tea production,"A parade of workers at a plantation in Sreemangal upazila of Moulvibazar are seen carrying sacks of freshly harvested tea for weighing before being sent to refineries in other regions. The ongoing heatwave could take a toll on production this year as the plants are mostly withering. PHOTO: Mintu Deshwara

Tea farmers in Bangladesh are concerned about seeing lower yields this year as much of their trees have been afflicted by various diseases and pests amid the ongoing heatwave and insufficient rain.

With this backdrop, experts suggest that farmers irrigate their fields rather than wait for rainfall in order to restore the normal growth cycle.

Mujibur Rahman, an assistant of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department in Sreemangal upazila of Moulvibazar, said local temperatures were as high as 38 degrees Celsius in the third week of April.

""Such extreme heat leads to health issues for humans and plants alike,"" he added.

Rahman also said temperatures in the region have been hovering around 35 degrees Celsius, which is much higher that what tea trees can tolerate.

As a result, buds that manage to take hold are turning pale while some trees are seeing their leaves drop before even reaching this stage.

Besides, production will definitely decrease if the plants do not get enough water through either natural or artificial means, he added.

Shamim Ahmed Chowdhury, manager of Shirajnagor Tea Garden, said another issue is that red spider mites are spreading as the hot and dry weather creates ample ground for them to multiply.

The leaves of tea trees are falling off before beginning to bud as the scorching heat continues to bear down on plantations.

The pests feed on tree sap, meaning that there is little left to carry nutrients to its leaves. As such, the plants begin to wither before eventually dying out.

Heat stress is also to blame for the lack of buds as the plants become afflicted with fungal diseases that prevent healthy growth.

Another reason is the invasion of loopers, which are caterpillar larvae of different moth species that feed on the leaves.

""But if the excessive heat cools down through rainfall, then these problems will be gradually fixed,"" Chowdhury said, adding that farmers could also apply pesticides.

Jahar Tarafder, member secretary of the Tea Planters and Traders Association of Bangladesh, said many trees are dying amid the ongoing drought.

""The industry will be in a dire situation if this continues for long,"" he added.

Tarafder went on to say that while 70 per cent of the tea trees had buds by this time last year, less than 20 per cent are currently budding.

Golam Mohammad Shiblee, chairman of the Sylhet chapter of the Bangladesh Tea Association, a platform of tea garden owners, said the local tea industry completely depends on rain.

Tea plantations need at least 5 to 7 inches of rain from January to March but such volumes were not seen this season, he added.

Dr Rafiqul Haque, director of the project development unit of Bangladesh Tea Board, said tea plants can thrive under conditions of 30 to 32 degrees Celsius while yields become moderate when temperatures reach 34 degrees Celsius.

""But production is almost completely gone when temperatures exceed 35 degrees Celsius,"" he added.

Haque then said they are advising tea farmers to provide mulch under new seedlings while also ensuring irrigation so that the plants are nourished properly.

In addition, they advise farmers to plant their trees in shade and at least 20 feet apart to ensure proper growing conditions.

The tea industry had faced losses due to labour unrest last year and now the effects of climate change could do the same this year, he added.

According to the Bangladesh Tea Board, 9.38 crore kilogrammes of tea was produced by 167 gardens across the country in 2022, down 3 per cent from 9.65 crore the year before.

This year, the production target is 10.20 crore kilogrammes from more than 2.85 lakh acres of land.",2023-05-10 02:30:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/economy/news/extreme-heat-hampering-tea-production-3315716,2023-05-18 10:19:40,thedailystar
83,Is a policy directive enough to stop school bullying?,"This isn't the first time that regulations and directives have been issued by education authorities regarding bullying

The Ministry of Education has issued the ""Policy for the Prevention of Bullying and Ragging in Educational Institutions, 2023"" to prevent bullying in educational institutions and punish the perpetrators around Bangladesh. But how far can a central directive go in achieving the results? What else should be done?

Bullying among peers is a common antisocial behaviour among children and adolescents in most cultures. When this happens in a school setting, supposedly a safe and stimulating environment where children would learn, thrive and flourish, this is unacceptable. Yet, this is far too common a situation.

School bullying of a student takes many forms: corporal punishment as a disciplinary measure; physical violence; verbal humiliation; gender-based violence; and abuse prompted by personal attributes such as disabilities, and any other distinguishing features such as physical appearance, ethnicity, language or socioeconomic background. The perpetrators are not just the peers, but sometimes teachers, administrators, and school staff.

A Unicef survey in Bangladesh in 2019 indicated that a quarter of the children of 10-17 years of age have been victims of bullying. This is likely to be a large underestimate. The prevalence and impact of bullying are difficult to quantify because of its interpersonal nature, the diverse ways in which it is manifested, not often overt, and the immediate and longer-term effects that are not easy to detect.

The problem is not new; it has been the subject of public debate, received media attention, and even attracted judicial interventions. There have also been regulations and directives issued by the education authorities regarding physical violence and verbal abuse of students by teachers. In a way, it is surprising that a policy now has been issued regarding this long-standing and pervasive phenomenon. The question is if and how the new directive can make a difference.

Looking at the pattern of bullying and transgressions of student safety and rights at different levels of education, a pattern can be observed. At the tertiary level, it is the ruling regime-supported student organisations that are involved in various illegal activities and in exercising control over the general student bodies. Bullying and violence in these circumstances can be restrained only by a political decision to cut loose the ties of political protection and patronage to the student wings and make them subject to the normal academic code of conduct.

Over two decades ago, the Education Policy, 2010 recognised the problem and provided some guidelines as solutions. For example, it suggested initiating student welfare and counselling services at all educational levels, with designated teachers to be trained to deliver counselling (Chapter 22). A working committee would also be formed with teachers, guardians, students and community representatives to improve the (learning and physical) environment in each school at primary and secondary levels. For higher education institutions, action plans will be prepared to take effective measures (Chapter 22). It also suggested that codes of conduct be adopted for teachers and learners at all levels of education, a purpose of which would be to ensure that students ""do not face any physical or mental tortures"" (Chapter 28).

The authorities have not taken the necessary steps to implement these policy recommendations. The most egregious incidents that drew public and media attention prompted judicial intervention. On October 7, 2019, Abrar Fahad, a student of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet), was beaten to death by the activists of the student wing of the ruling party (BCL) for allegedly making a post on Facebook that was critical of the government. The High Court then directed the government to form within three months anti-bullying committees at all educational institutions, especially universities and colleges. No systematic action followed this court ruling.

On August 21, 2021, the High Court bench issued a ruling asking the authorities concerned to explain their inaction in stopping bullying at educational institutions. Then, on February 16 this year, the High Court sounded alarm about the physical torture of a female student of the Islamic University in Kushtia allegedly by a group of BCL members. The current policy directive appears to be a belated and hesitant response to the judicial observations and public concern.

Looking at the pattern of bullying and transgressions of student safety and rights at different levels of education, a pattern can be observed. At the tertiary level, it is the ruling regime-supported student organisations that are involved in various illegal activities and in exercising control over the general student bodies. Bullying and violence in these circumstances can be restrained only by a political decision to cut loose the ties of political protection and patronage to the student wings and make them subject to the normal academic code of conduct.

There is a gender and sexual dimension to bullying, ragging and intimidation, which cuts across the types and levels of institutions. Girl students are especially vulnerable in the prevailing patriarchal norms and values in society. Mindset, customs and habits of teachers, institutional managers, students – both boys and girls – and families of students are complicit, directly or indirectly, in creating and maintaining the environment that makes girls vulnerable.

There is the common behaviour pattern and psychology of children and adolescents, often characterised by jealousy, rivalry, selfishness, insecurity and a lack of self-esteem, that lead young people to antisocial behaviour and picking on those who seem to be different or weak. This situation is commonly evident at the primary and secondary school levels. The educational experience of students in the classroom and outside, and the extracurricular activities need to recognise this reality. Teachers, parents, and school administrators have to be alert to the situation and need to examine their own attitudes and values in this respect. The school experience should also nurture among learners empathy, appreciation of diversity, and respect for differences.

It is in the sphere of children and teenage behaviour patterns and the need for guidance, counselling, support, and learning the norms of social interaction as children grow up that the policy guidance and various measures proposed are likely to be particularly relevant. In respect of the politics-generated misconduct at the tertiary institutions, and the gender-related vulnerability of girl students, the policy directives can be of help only to the extent that these are supported by policy shift and mindset change beyond the school premises, particularly at the higher tiers of political decision-making.

The social and cultural conditions that have fostered the environment for bullying and the values that allow tolerance of such behaviour are alive and well. So is the political culture that has prevented the efforts to change the conditions. The key actors have to recognise these obstacles and find ways to work around them to implement the policy.

84,Escape from Khartoum horrors,"136 Bangladeshis come home

Ali Sheikh had to leave home with his family after being confined there for around two weeks amidst a civil war in the Sudanese capital Khartoum.

After staying at a hotel for a few days, they got a chance to escape the city on May 2, as a bus would transport them to Port Sudan.

From there, they and many other stranded Bangladeshis were taken to Jeddah and then brought back home yesterday on a Biman flight.

However, the journey was not as easy as it reads.

While boarding the bus that would take them to Port Sudan, another city in the Northeast African country, the to-be-evacuated Bangladeshis found themselves smack-dab in the middle of firing between the clashing rival factions of the Sudan military government.

The violence has been going on since April 15.

Video of কেমন আছেন সুদানে অবস্থানরত বাংলাদেশিরা

Ali and his family, who had been living in Khartoum for 18 years, had to run back into the hotel and could only come out again when the gunfight eased and another bus came to take them to Port Sudan.

""The bombings destroyed everything in Khartoum. There were airstrikes that hit buildings adjacent to my home. We could not sleep at night amid the sounds of heavy bombing and gunfire. I don't even know if my house is still standing,"" Ali, who worked at a private company in Khartoum, told The Daily Star at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport yesterday.

They came back home on Sunday -- almost empty-handed, carrying only one small luggage, leaving most of their belongings back in Sudan.

With them, 132 other Bangladeshis were flown to Jeddah from Port Sudan in three Saudi Air Force planes.

They were supposed to be transported by ships through the Red Sea, but as those were unavailable, the Saudi authorities arranged several aircraft.

The 136 returnees -- making up the first batch of 700 stranded Bangladeshis to be repatriated from Port Sudan via Jeddah -- were provided with immediate cash and food support at HSIA by the government and the International Organisation for Migration.

According to the Bangladesh government, there were around 1,500 Bangladeshis living in Sudan. All of them will be gradually evacuated and brought home, officials said.

Abdul Kashem, 48, was in the first batch.

Empty-handed, he left his home in Khartoum over two weeks ago and had been wearing the same set of clothes and was able to shower only twice since then.

""There were incidents of looting by men in uniform. They took away [almost all] my belongings,"" said Kashem, who had been living in Sudan for 12 years.

Meanwhile, Moni Rahman had to come back to Bangladesh leaving her husband behind at Port Sudan, as the family has three clothing shops in Khartoum that need to be run.

""He stayed back hoping the situation will improve. These shops are all we have.""

She said though she had to spend a night under the open sky during the evacuation process, the Bangladeshi community in Khartoum had done everything they could to ease her journey back home.

Meanwhile, Shaki Akhter, a Bangladeshi mother of three, doubted whether she would make it out alive, with her electricity and water supply cut off amid heavy bombing near her building, and Kamal Hossain was a victim of robbing and mugging that took place amid the conflict.

Fortunately, they too were able to come back home on Sunday.

Welcoming the returnees at the HSIA, Asad Alam Siam, additional secretary of the foreign ministry, said those who are still in Sudan will hopefully be evacuated and repatriated home safely soon.

Different ministries, the IOM, Biman, and Bangladesh missions in Saudi Arabia and Sudan have been doing their best to this end, he added.

Speaking to journalists at the airport, Expatriates' Welfare Minister Imran Ahmad said his ministry, through the Wage Earners' Welfare Board, has readied $200,000 for the repatriation of the Bangladeshis from Sudan.

Besides, it will provide reintegration support, he said, urging the returnees to register themselves in this regard with the ministry to avail the facilities.

He added that the flight carrying the next batch of evacuees may reach Dhaka today or tomorrow.

Fathima Nusrath Ghazzali, officer-in-charge of IOM Bangladesh, said the UN migration agency will continue to provide its support for the safe return of the Bangladeshi nationals stranded in Sudan.

Siddiqur Rahman, acting managing director of Biman, said the national flag carrier will operate flights gradually to carry home all 1,500 Bangladeshis back home.",2023-05-09 01:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/escape-khartoum-horrors-3314556,2023-05-18 10:19:43,thedailystar
85,Ananda Cinema Hall empty despite 'Pathaan’ running,"Shah Rukh Khan starrer ""Pathaan"" has been running successfully all over the country and the Capital's Ananda Cinema Hall is no exception either, with four screenings every day.

However, there are no audiences in the cinema hall, which is situated at the heart of the Farmgate area. It has been observed that among the DC section's 540 seats, only 15 viewers came to see the 12 pm screening of ""Pathaan"". Apart from that, among 570 seats of general section, only 20 to 25 people came in to watch the film today.

Monsur, an employee of the cinema hall informed that he had been working here for a long while and is saddened at the fading excitement of the hall-goers. He also added that there aren't many ""Pathaan"" viewers coming in, which can't be said for the audiences streaming into the multiplexes around the country.

On a similar note, two students from Titumir College informed The Daily Star of their disappointment. Mehedi and Ashraf had come to join the 12 pm showing of ""Pathaan"".

""We heard a lot about the film so we came to see it. But we were expecting a lot more people.""

A security guard at Ananda Cinema Hall added, ""There have been a meagre number of viewers since the film's release. Nothing changed despite bringing in Hindi films.""

Ananda Hall has been holding regular screenings of ""Pathaan"" at 12:30 pm, 3:00 pm, 6:00 pm and 9:00 pm.

The release of ""Pathaan"" in Bangladesh ended an 8-year gap of a Hindi movie being screened in the country, and it has created a lot of buzz among the audience. The film was released in 41 theatres nationwide, including Star Cineplex, Blockbuster Cinemas, and Madhumita Cinema Hall.",2023-05-17 14:53:45,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/ananda-cinema-hall-empty-despite-pathaan-running-3322656,2023-05-18 10:19:44,thedailystar
86,Release of Pori Moni starrer ‘Maa’ postponed,"Pori Moni featurette ""Maa"" was initially supposed to hit the theatres on May 19.

The Liberation War-based film has been directed by Aranyo Anawer. The film will have a screening at the 76th Cannes Film Festival, on May 20. As per the rules, a film cannot be released before its screening at the festival. Thus, the release of the film has been postponed by a week.

Now, ""Maa"" will be released on May 26. Meanwhile, the director is attending the Cannes Film Festival.

87,Bangladeshi stall struggling at Cannes Film Festival?,"Yesterday, the 76th Cannes Film Festival, considered the most prestigious international film festivals around the world, was officially inaugurated. For the first time, a stall has been allocated for Bangladesh at the event. Located beside the Indian stall, it was seen that the booth is completely empty.

A booth was booked on the name of Bangladesh Film Development Corporation (BFDC), however, even on the second day of the festival, no one seemed to be there at the stall.

Stalls at the Cannes Film Festival are expected to be a gateway to the respective country's cinema and culture – with a plethora of discussion and banter between journalists and stars -- but until now, no significant buzz has been created by the Bangladeshi contingent as of yet.

A booth was booked on the name of Bangladesh Film Development Corporation (BFDC), however, even on the second day of the festival, no one seemed to be there at the stall.

It had been reported that Nipun Akter and Zayed Khan were supposed to attend the festival and on behalf of BFDC, as attendees. However, Zayed Khan told The Daily Star that he had no knowledge of the matter. ""I don't know much about it, I had heard about it from news portals, but nothing official was announced about our involvement,"" he said.

Nipun also told The Daily Star, that she is not going either, even though she heard of such plans before.

Meanwhile, a few journalists from Bangladesh, along with filmmakers like Mostofa Kamal Raz, Aronyo Anawer, Swapan Ahmed, Sazzad Khan and Noyeem Imtiaz Neamul, were also present at the festival's opening day.

88,Ben Affleck delivers an instant cult classic with ‘Air’,"The Nike Air Jordans have become the household names for sneakers in the last 40 years. Air, directed by Ben Affleck and starring Matt Damon as Sonny Vaccaro, follows Nike's quest for Michael Jordan, giving an inimitable perspective into a deal which changed sports forever.

Initially, I was cynical, thinking it's just another poor addition in a line of badly executed sports films. My reservations, though, were quashed within the first 300 seconds.

Air isn't your typical biographical film. It serves with a perfect dressing of 1980s nostalgia, spiced-up by corporate drama and perfectly seasoned with lots of smalltown American humour.

In 1984, Nike was unrecognisable. Owing to poor sales and no chance in signing top young players, they almost shut down their basketball operations.

This made Nike's talent scout Sonny Vaccaro upset. Despite his best efforts, including organising high-school All-Star games and merchandise giveaways, Nike failed to attract players. Against this backdrop, a chance game-tape analysis of Jordan set into motion a set of incredible events.

Putting his career on the line, Sonny convinced marketing VP Rob Strasser and CEO Phil Knight to allocate the entire budget for Jordan. Although Sonny got harshly rebuffed by agent David Falk, he took matter into his own hands, driving upto the Jordans' house in North Carolina.

His exchange with Jordan's mother, Deloris, was poetic. Sonny flawlessly predicted the meeting outcomes – Converse wouldn't put Jordan over Magic Johnson and Larry Bird as the primary athlete, while Michael's preference, Adidas offered an uncertain future. That convinced Michael to meet Nike.

While Jordan was away, Sonny and Nike's shoe designer, Peter Moore, started designing the prototype. Moore's artiste resulted in the birth of Air Jordan I in only 2 days. They challenged the accepted norms, risking a USD 5,000-per-game fine for not complying to the NBA's 51 percent white-colour scheme.

Sonny was the show-stealer during the pitch. The passion and commitment he showed at THAT improvised speech told the story of someone who fully believed in the latent talents and the competitive mentality which Michael always possessed. The words ""money can buy you everything, not immortality"" resonates in all walks of life even today.

For his acting, Matt Damon deserves immense plaudits. He literally lived as Sonny Vaccaro. Damon captured Sonny's eccentricity, intelligence, out-of-shape body and knack for sniffing out basketball talents immaculately. Jason Bateman, for his part, delivered the perfect ice to Sonny's fire as Strasser.

Ben Affleck's attention to detail in his performance as Knight, setting props and choosing classical American pop songs throughout the movie, ensured that this movie mastered the art of storytelling through humour and music.

Amidst the brilliant acting and musical storytelling, I couldn't help but respect the cinematography. Depiction of the countryside, Jordans' family home and Nike's smalltown office is as precise as it gets.

In short, Air dribbled with grace, delicately took off and dropped an instantly iconic slam dunk.

89,Cannes opens its doors to the world,"On Tuesday, arguably one of the most hyped events of the entertainment world, the Cannes Film Festival opened its doors to the world for the 76th time. The festival kicked-off with the premiere of the Louis XV period-drama, ""Jeanne du Barry"", which stars Johnny Depp.

The red carpet on the opening night saw a sea of stars like Brie Larson, Uma Thurman, Gong Li, Elle Fanning, Naomi Campbell, Catherine Deneuve and a blue-haired Helen Mirren.

Johnny Depp swarmed by fans.

During the opening ceremony, Michael Douglas and Harrison Ford were given the honorary Palme d'Or. While everything seemed perfect in the moment, there was a feeling of unease, what with the ongoing strike by screenwriters in Hollywood, which could have an unpredictable impact on the festival. France itself is also suffering from recent labour unrest, as protests are planned to take place for the recently changed pension system in the country.

At the same time, the recent announcement by Adèle Haenel, one of the top French actors, that she was quitting the French film industry for ""complacency toward sexual aggressors"" has also left many uneasy over attending the festival. This was further amplified after the Cannes Film Festival chief, Thierry Fremaux rejected her criticisms while addressing members of the media on Monday.

However, the festival, lined up with highly-anticipated big-budget films including James Mangold's ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of the Destiny"" and Martin Scorsese's ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", is unlikely to be hindered despite the controversy.

Additionally, just the list of stars who are set to hit the red carpet over the next week and a half—like Natalie Portman, Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Sean Penn, Alicia Vikander, Scarlett Johansson and Abel Tesfaye (The Weeknd) --- means few will bat an eye eventually.

The endless crowd of onlookers screamed Johnny Depp's name, while signs all over the venue read ""Viva Johnny"", as he arrived in purple-tinted sunglasses and signed autographs. ""Jeanne du Barry"" is in many ways being considered Depp's comeback to Cannes, after his infamous trial with ex-wife Amber Heard last year. The last time Depp made a red-carpet outing was during the Rome Film Festival in 2021.

After the screening, audiences celebrated Depp with a standing ovation, during which the actor teared up.

This year is also a special one for Bangladesh, as the country will be taking its first ever stall to Cannes. Besides that, Aronyo Anawer directorial ""Maa"", starring Pori Moni as the lead, will be showcased at the Marche Du Film section on May 20.

Many Bollywood celebrities were also seen adding glamour to the red carpet, including Sara Ali Khan, Manushi Chillar, Urvashi Rautela and Esha Gupta. This would be Sara Ali Khan's Cannes debut, and the actress would put a desi spin on her look, wearing a gorgeous lehenga instead of a gown— like her co-workers—to the red carpet.

Some other films, that will be screened at the festival, include ""The Zone of Interest"", directed by Jonathan Glazer; ""Banel & Adama"", by French-Senegalese filmmaker Ramata-Toulaye Sy; ""Occupied City"" by Steve McQueen; ""The Old Oak"", directed by Ken Loach and ""Asteroid City"" by Wes Anderson, just to name a few.

90,‘I shot Sareng Bou with 103° fever’,"Legendary actor and freedom fighter Farooque's contribution to the Bangladeshi film industry is incomparable, having gifted numerous well-loved cinemas. Before the actor fell sick, The Daily Star had spoken to him on multiple occasions, recalling his golden days. Such a narration has been brought forth for the audiences to enjoy, on the eve of actor's departure.

""'Sareng Bou' was adapted from the eminent writer and journalist Shahidullah Kaiser's famous novel of them same name, directed by another legend, Abdullah Al Mamun. He beautifully captured the essence of the rural Bangladesh and the struggles of a Sareng. I instantly loved the story when the director explained it to me, started imagining myself in the main character's shoes. Then I took whatever steps necessary, and ventured out in front of the camera"".

""There is still one story that I remember"", continued the actor. ""We were shooting outdoors, and I fell very sick. There was no room for adjustment, as Kabori had to return to Dhaka that day after shooting, I would have to shoot as well. Then what? I had no choice but to shoot with a 103-degree Celsius fever. Despite there being so many people on the set, I didn't inform anyone about my sickness, incase that hampers with the shooting of the film"".

""Sareng Bou"" then went onto become a super hit film, earning accolades and admirations from people all over the country. The late actor mused that his character Kadam earned a lot of praise, along with Kabori's character as well. Adding that, even after decades of the film's release, ""Sareng Bou"" is still as loved as it was before, which he found fascinating, noting that this is all that matters to him.

""'Noyonmoni' film's shoot was also done outdoor, in a village. I had paired up with Babita in that, whom I deem to be very smart and modern. Urban characters suited very well. The film was directed by Amjad Hossain and was another superhit. People still hum songs from that film"".

Recalling more of his superhit films, Farooque mentioned ""Golapi Ekhon Traine"" and ""Sujon Sokhi"", ""Lathiyal"", with ""Sujon Sokhi"" having been a record-breaking hit, that ran in theatres for months, cementing the legendary actor with some of the stars of the Bangladeshi silver screen.

93,"City were better and deserved to win, says Ancelotti","Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti admitted they were beaten by the better side as they suffered a painful 4-0 demolition at Manchester City on Wednesday that completed a 5-1 aggregate defeat in their Champions League semi-final.

City, who were beaten by Real at the same stage last season, avenged that heartbreaking defeat with a brilliant performance in front of their jubilant fans, with only Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois preventing them inflicting even more damage.

""They played better than us and deserved to win,"" Ancelotti told reporters.

""They put a lot of pressure at the beginning, it worked out well for them because they made it very difficult for us to get the ball in play and they went two goals ahead.

""From then on, it was difficult to get back into the game. We tried in the second half... but it didn't work out.""

Ancelotti admitted it was a painful night but said it was too soon to analyse what had gone wrong.

""Evaluating today, at this moment, makes no sense,"" he said.

""It is a defeat that hurts, it hurts a lot. But it can happen. We reached the semi-finals of the Champions League against a strong opponent, they played better and left us without a final. We have to learn and for the next season, to be better.""

A year after winning a LaLiga and Champions League double, and becoming the first manager to capture titles in each of Europe's top five leagues, Ancelotti was facing up to finishing the campaign with just a Spanish Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup to show for their efforts.

He did, however, set another record on Wednesday, becoming the coach with the most European Cup games (191), surpassing the mark set by former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.

But with their rivals Barcelona crowned LaLiga champions last weekend with four-games to spare, Ancelotti was left searching for a silver lining.

""I think it was a good season. We have to show up in the few games we have ahead of us,"" Ancelotti said.

""I think that reaching a Champions League semi-final is a success because only four teams make it to the last four.""",2023-05-18 01:55:15,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/city-were-better-and-deserved-win-says-ancelotti-3323076,2023-05-18 10:19:51,thedailystar

Rafael Nadal will announce if he will compete in the French Open on Thursday, amid a long-term injury struggle and some Spanish reports that he will withdraw.

The 22-time Grand Slam winner has battled to recover from a hip injury he sustained in January at the Australian Open, not playing since then.

""If he plays or not and the reasons either way will only be communicated tomorrow,"" said a spokesman for Nadal on Wednesday.

Nadal will speak at 4pm local time (1400 GMT) on Thursday at his Rafa Nadal academy in Mallorca.

The Spaniard, 36, pulled out of the Barcelona and Madrid Open tournaments among others in the run-up to Roland Garros, and earlier in May confirmed he would not participate in the Italian Open.

The French Open, which he has won on a record 14 occasions, starts in Paris on May 28.

Nadal's struggles with fitness over the past couple of years have created wider doubts concerning his career. He has competed in just four matches in 2023, winning only once.

The superstar hoped to battle with Novak Djkovic in Paris for a record extending 23rd Grand Slam, after the Serb pulled level with him by winning the Australian Open.

""It depends if Nadal plays or not,"" joked Djokovic this week when asked if the French Open would be the most open for two decades.

Nadal turned down a wildcard offer for a Challenger tournament in Bordeaux next week as he tried to win his race to make Roland Garros.

He has competed at the tournament in France every year since 2005, which was the first time he won it.

The current world number 14, who turns 37 in June, has only lost three times at the French Open since his debut at the tournament.

In 2016, he was forced to withdraw from the tournament before the third round with a wrist injury.

Nadal has never played at the French Open without a warm-up event on clay.

The Spaniard's last match was a straight-sets defeat by American player Mackenzie McDonald in the second round of the Australian open.

The veteran pulled out of hard-court tournaments in the US in March, aiming to make the start of the clay court season, but his injury recovery did not progress as planned.

Earlier in May, Nadal said his injury situation had improved with a new treatment, but not sufficiently to be able to play in Rome this week.

Physical problems have dogged Nadal through his glittering career and there are fears they may soon bring it to an end.",2023-05-18 02:16:37,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/more-sports/tennis/news/nadal-reveal-french-open-decision-amid-injury-concerns-3323086,2023-05-18 10:19:53,thedailystar
95,Etihad awaits epic clash,"It's not an exaggeration to suggest that tonight's Champions League semifinal second leg against defending champions Real Madrid is the biggest game in Manchester City's recent history.

With the Premier League title all but wrapped up after Arsenal's defeat to Brighton at the weekend, and a FA Cup final against Manchester United -- where City will be heavy favourites -- Real Madrid stand between them and the chance of going for an historic treble.

But this is the Champions League. And this is Real Madrid, a side that thrive in knockout competition. So much so that it can sometimes feel like they can channel black magic to drag themselves out of desperate situations.

As recently as last year, when these two sides met in the semifinal and Rodrygo's injury-time brace took the tie into extra time. From that point on, Karim Benzema's winning penalty seemed inevitable.

It was the second time that City had been eliminated from a UCL semifinal, after Real Madrid inflicted the same pain on them in 2015-16. Should they fail to progress here, it would be the first time that a team have been eliminated by the same side in the semifinals in consecutive UEFA Champions League campaigns.

But there is one crucial difference from the trauma of Madrid last year. The second leg of this tie is at the Etihad Stadium, and Man City have made their home ground somewhat of a fortress in recent European competitions.

In the first leg it was the holders who had drawn first blood when Man City looked the more likely to make the net ripple. But when Carlo Ancelotti's men appeared destined to extend their lead, a sizzling strike from De Bruyne -- displaying outrageous technique to pick out the bottom corner -- ensured that Pep Guardiola's side would take a 1-1 draw back to their headquarters.

Avoiding a Bernabeu beating was priority number one for Man City's treble chasers, who will undeniably enter Wednesday's second leg with the favourites tag embroidered on their shirts.

Victory over the Spanish giants would put Guardiola's men in prime position to become just the second side ever after Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United to win the treble of Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup in the same season.

""How fortunate we are. We are incredibly lucky to be here. It's in our hands, it depends on us, we don't have to do something exceptional, just be ourselves and win one game to reach a final,"" Guardiola said at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday.

Defender Kyle Walker, who did a good job in the first leg but still came out second best against Real Madrid's scorer in the first leg in Vinicius Junior, said he would not want to be turned into an internet meme tonight.

Walker was responsible for Vinicius down the left flank of Madrid, and Guardiola would probably depend on Walker's pace to thwart the lightning Brazilian.

""I went to hug him [after the first leg] because he tried to rainbow flick me. I was like please don't try that again and make me a meme. Boxers have a battle and shake hands after. You give the level of respect because they deserve it. Carrying a massive club over the line in the CL, you show your respect. Tomorrow night, I'll give him the respect he deserves but before that is dog eat dog,"" Walker said.",2023-05-17 02:15:24,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/etihad-awaits-epic-clash-3321771,2023-05-18 10:19:54,thedailystar
96,Livingstone belts 94 in vain as Punjab's play-off hopes fade,"Punjab Kings' Liam Livingstone plays a shot during the Indian Premier League (IPL) Twenty20 cricket match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamsala on May 17, Photo: AFP

Delhi Capitals survived a blazing 94 by Liam Livingstone for a consolation 15-run win on Wednesday to push Punjab Kings to the brink of IPL elimination on Wednesday.

South Africa's Rilee Rossouw smashed an unbeaten 82 to guide Punjab to 213-2, a total that was threatened by Livingstone's 48-ball blitz in the Himalayan hill town of Dharamsala.

Livingstone and Atharva Taide put on a 78-run stand. After Taide retired out on 55, the rest of the batting fell flat.

Delhi, who were already out of the play-off-race, kept the opposition to 198-8 despite Livingstone's nine sixes and sloppy fielding, including two dropped catches.

""It was a bad performance in the field but we will take the win,"" Delhi skipper David Warner said.

Punjab stay eighth in the 10-team table and need to win their final group match and depend on other results and net-rate to make the play-offs.

""It was frustrating,"" Punjab captain Shikhar Dhawan said. ""We didn't bowl really well in the first six wickets, we should have taken some wickets the way it was swinging.""

IPL heavyweights Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings are two of the seven team in contention for three remaining play-off spots in the T20 tournament.

Defending champions Gujarat Titans became the first team to qualify for the play-offs early this week and assured themselves a top-two finish in the group stage.

Warner (46) and Prithvi Shaw (54) put on 94 runs for the opening wicket to lay the foundation for Delhi's mammoth total.

The left-handed Warner set the pace with his attacking 31-ball knock as he hit former Delhi pace bowler Kagiso Rabada for two sixes.

Punjab left-arm quick and big buy Sam Curran denied Warner his fifty, but the left-handed Rossouw came in attacking with sixes and fours.

Shaw raised his fifty before falling to Curran. Rossouw finished off the innings with a destructive partnership with England's Phil Salt.

Rossouw, who struck his first IPL half-century and was named man of the match, and Salt, who hit a 14-ball 26, took apart the opposition attack as they scored 41 runs in the final two overs.",2023-05-17 18:49:45,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/cricket/news/livingstone-belts-94-vain-punjabs-play-hopes-fade-3322961,2023-05-18 10:19:54,thedailystar
97,Cabrera eyes SAFF semis despite Lebanon in group,"Bangladesh coach Javier Cabrera took a positive view of the draw for the upcoming SAFF Championship and said he wants to grab the opportunity to advance to the semifinals of the regional football event, which is scheduled for June 21 to July 4 in Bengaluru, India.

With two teams from Middle East – Lebanon and Kuwait, invited to the regional tournament for the first time, Bangladesh were drawn in comparatively easier Group B alongside top-ranked Lebanon, Maldives and Bhutan. Group A features hosts India, Kuwait, Nepal and Pakistan.

Bangladesh, the 2003 champion, could not get out of the group stages in the last five editions. The recent performance of the men in red and green is not that promising, yet Cabrera is hopeful about making it to the semifinals.

""Both groups are very tough. We got the highest ranked team of Lebanon. We believe if we are able to perform at the level that we have to, then we will have chances to achieve the objective, which is semifinals,"" Cabrera told reporters following the draw in New Delhi.

In reply to another question, the Spaniard said, ""We believe we can make things difficult for everyone as we are going to give our best to make the semifinal possible. The plan is to win two matches to go to the semifinals.""

Bangladesh team will start a residential camp from June 4 and will play an international friendly against Cambodia on June 15 before heading to Bengaluru for the SAFF Championship.",2023-05-17 18:07:27,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/cabrera-eyes-saff-semis-despite-lebanon-group-3322566,2023-05-18 10:19:55,thedailystar
98,Top 5 AC hacks to lower your electricity bills this summer,"The scorching summer heat is making everyone use Air Conditioners more than ever, which brings the stress of a high electricity bill, but with the right AC use hacks, you can have a comfortable time inside your home by reducing your energy expenditure and in turn, lower your electric bills. Here are the top 5 AC use hacks you can try to lower your electric bills.

Use the right temperature

Your AC energy consumption largely depends on the temperature you set. According to a study; you can save as much as 30 per cent in electric bills if you use your AC at 25 to 27 degrees Celsius instead of 18 degrees. This is because at lower temperatures, your AC has to work at its highest capacity to make your room cool, so it's better to set your AC at a comfortable temperature for reduced energy expenditure to keep the bills low.

Use sleep timers and fan to your advantage

You may feel like your AC has to be on all night to have a sound sleep, but that will definitely contribute towards a hefty electric bill. An easy way around this is to use your AC's sleep function to good use. Set the sleep function for either an hour or two. By that time, the AC will turn off on its own and the room will have cooled off enough. Alternatively, you can also set a timer for specific periods of time and then turn on the fan in your room, as the fan will continue to regulate the cold air even after the AC compressor has turned off.

Most modern AC's have auto restart function these days. With that, you can set your AC to turn on at select intervals, making it an excellent cost and energy saving alternative than using the AC all the time.

Make sure to cool your room internally

Your AC will have to work hard if your internal room temperature is already high thanks to sunlight entering your room through your windows and doors. One way around this is to use heavy curtains that will block sun light from completely entering your room. If you don't have heavy curtains, you can just drape something heavy like an extra bed sheet on your windows. Also check for any gaps between the doors and, plug any gaps like in the ventilator so that the cool air of AC can stay contained.

Keep your AC well-maintained

As a heavy home appliance, your AC will give you top performance if you maintain it properly. Things like a dirty air filter can significantly increase your AC energy use, reduce cooling efficiency, while also reducing the airflow and hampering the quality of your indoor air. So, always make sure to clean your AC filters at least once a month. Be sure to have a proper AC servicing once or twice a year, especially before the start of the summer to ensure your AC is giving its best and most energy efficient performance.

Invest in an energy efficient AC

With certain tips and tricks, your AC will have less energy expenditure, but if you want your AC to be cost effective while its running, then it's best to invest in energy efficient ACs like those with inverters. According to different studies, you can save anywhere from 30 per cent to 50 per cent in your electric bills with inverter ACs.",2023-05-17 10:27:55,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/top-5-ac-hacks-lower-your-electricity-bills-summer-3322466,2023-05-18 10:19:56,thedailystar
99,Should we be concerned about AI?,"How the Godfather of AI looks at the future of his creations.

Artificial Intelligence has been known to be the next frontier in advancing technology as we know it. It has tons of potential to revolutionise many industries from healthcare to quantum computing. However, it also brings forth many dangers that come with its development and advancement that we might not be able to understand now in the present. So, it's crucial that we be open about its pros and cons and its development timeline. One notable individual took it upon himself to do just that.

Geoffrey Hinton, often called the 'Godfather of AI' confirmed on Monday that he has left his job at Google last week to bring attention to the potential harm AI can cause, a technology which he helped bring to life in the first place. He said he had to leave Google to be able to speak freely about AI and its hazards.

Geoffrey Hinton is a lifelong academic who has been committed to the development of AI since the 80s. He was actually the first person to embrace the idea of a neural network where a computer can be trained to think, talk and feel like a human being. After his brief stint at Carnegie Mellon University, he left for Canada because he didn't want to continue his work with the Pentagon funding from the US government.

Dr Hinton and two of his students, Ilya Sutskever and Alex Krishevsky developed a neural network in 2012 that could analyse hundreds of photographs and teach itself to recognize common items like cars, pets, and flowers. Google then bought his company out for USD $44 million. This technology led to the creation of technologies such as ChatGPT and Google Bard.

Around this time, Google and OpenAI started developing their neural networks, which were powerful but according to Dr Hinton, was still inferior to human languages. It was last year that his views had changed after seeing the sheer amount of data being used by these companies. ""Maybe what's going on in these systems is better than what is going on in the brain,"" he stated.

He thinks that when companies advance their AI systems, they grow more dangerous. ""Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now, take the difference and propagate it forwards. That's scary,"" Dr Hinton stated.

After the inauguration of Microsoft's chatbot, Google has been racing to do the same with its own version. His immediate concern is that the tech titans will be locked in a competition that will be unstoppable in the future. He also voiced his concerns about the job market. Currently, chatbots like ChatGPT only support humans, but according to Dr Hinton, in the future, they may take over clerical jobs such as translators, personal assistants and paralegals to name a few.",2023-05-17 10:17:32,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/should-we-be-concerned-about-ai-3322451,2023-05-18 10:19:57,thedailystar
100,The ridiculousness of our curiosity: Tourists braving cyclone Mocha for ‘fun’,"Cyclone Mocha has been the topic of discussion for the last few days. We all expected to find information about the cyclone all over the news portals and social media, but the news that people are defying 'great danger signal' to witness the rough weather and seas was not something I expected. However, maybe it should not come as too big of a surprise.

""Of all creatures that breathe and move upon the earth, nothing is bred that is weaker than man"" — this is a line from Homer's Odyssey. Well, Homer said 'weaker' but 'ridiculous' is more apt these days. You might have thought the same when you saw reports that people were travelling to the beach (with their family too?) to 'experience' the cyclone.

Our need to 'experience' everything is nothing new. This need for experience has been seen very frequently lately. Whether it's a super cyclone or a dangerous flood, people are going out because apparently, they 'want to see.' Unlike the rest of the animal kingdom, which would run off at the first of danger, we love to be at the forefront of all sorts of troublesome situations.

This is just one example where it only affects the individual but what about instances of road accidents and fires. People will gather around to watch but very few will come forward to help. But credit should be given where it's due. The onlookers are always careful to gather in a circular or semi-circular crowd. At least they have a good sense of geometry! They might be standing in the way but they are looking good doing it.

And may God bless all the overly enthusiastic amateur photographers who cannot resist the urge to snap a selfie or record a video for their Tiktok or Facebook live, because otherwise how will you validate your thrill-seeking nature? A cyclone is coming? No worries. You can count on these brave members of the society to record every minute before the news media can ever gather their camera. Curiosity killed the cat, but not us. They may have nine lives, but our one life is tough enough to weather through many curiosities.

If Homer were alive, he could probably write another epic about our endless curiosity and I strongly believe that his script would be rejected because it's not realistic enough. After all, who is going to believe that people head towards natural calamities to 'relax' and 'chill' instead of running away from it?",2023-05-16 12:02:07,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/the-ridiculousness-our-curiosity-tourists-braving-cyclone-mocha-fun-3321651,2023-05-18 10:19:58,thedailystar
101,Is living in a joint family better?,"Family is where we feel safe, family is what we love, and family is what makes a house a home. While every family is unique in its own dynamic, it can still be categorised into two joint family and nuclear family. And along with the category comes the big question, is it better to live in a joint family or a nuclear family?

It's an interesting question with plenty of pros and cons on both sides. It has kept sociologists arguing for a long time. So, what is the correct answer? Or is there even a correct answer? Is a joint family truly better than a nuclear family? Or is it the other way around?

Joint family vs nuclear family

A joint family is a multigenerational family (two or more generations) that lives together under one roof, share the same kitchen, and the economic expenses. Which means a joint family is usually an expanded family where the parents live with their children and their spouses. Often there are more members in a joint family that might include but are not limited to grandparents, uncles, aunts, and even more members.

On the other hand, a nuclear family consists of just the parents and the children. There are no expansions, making a nuclear family one of the smallest units in society.

Which one is better?

Rakib Hasan from Jatrabari, Dhaka grew up in a joint family and even though Rakib and his siblings are all grown up and some of them are married, they are still living together. ""I grew up surrounded by people and I think this is the better way,"" he said.

""When there are more members in the family, you get cared for by everyone. In a smaller family, if the parents are away or sick, you have to worry about even the simplest things like cooking and what not. But in a larger family, if one person gets sick, someone will take care of him. Another member will make sure the chores are done and the children are cared for,"" he said pointing out that in a joint family he never gets lonely because there's always someone available to talk to.

However, Tamzida Tamanna from Bogura had a different point of view. ""I grew up in a joint family. We were eight cousins and I remember those days when we were little and we used to sit together during blackouts and sing,"" she said recalling her childhood.

""Those days were fun but as we grew up, there were issues. Different members of the family had different opinions about various things. Then there were the issues regarding the household chores. Such issues created contempt amongst family members. This is why I prefer nuclear family. I think even if you live apart, there's always love for family members. Which is better than contempt,"" said Tamanna.

Hazat Sabbir, a Dhaka University graduate had a very strong opinion regarding the issue. ""I think joint family is better than nuclear family without a doubt. Let me explain. The nuclear family has no members other than the children and the parents. Which means the chance for those children to interact with people is very limited. Even more so if the family lives in a city like Dhaka. Things get much worse if both of the parents are working. They leave the children with a babysitter. So, the children are getting very little interactions with other people, even less so with their parents which stands in their way of socialisation.""

Socialisation is the process through which individuals are prepared to become successful members of society. This is how the norms and ideologies of a society are internalised in an individual. Without proper socialisation, individuals can become less empathetic, less understanding, and society in turn will suffer.

""These children growing up in nuclear families without proper socialisation grow up to be adults who do not fit in the society. This causes suffering for the society and even more importantly for those individuals. They start to struggle. Mentally, socially, and every other way. So, for the sake of society itself and the individual person, I think a joint family is better."" Sabbir said before pointing out that he grew up in a nuclear family that used to move around often because of his father's job and it affected him.

The verdict

It is difficult to reach a definite decision regarding the question because every family has a different dynamic and every individual person is unique with their own personalities. Which means generalisation might not be a good idea. While a joint family has various advantages, there are some issues such as conflicts, economic issues, differences of opinion and perhaps most importantly, lack of privacy.

On the other hand, nuclear family offers plenty of privacy and freedom but at the cost of separation from your family and risking socialisation for the children. So, it comes down to the family members.

As someone who has lived in a joint family and a nuclear family, I think the correct choice depends on the family members more than any other variable and therefore your decision should be based on the situations of your family above anything else.",2023-05-15 11:28:31,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/living-joint-family-better-3320761,2023-05-18 10:19:58,thedailystar
102,Our theatre scene and its present challenges,"Theatre has a rich history in Bangladesh. Like many other art forms, it combines social commentary and dialogue with skilful acting and narratives to reach audiences. With the advent of various entertainment platforms and given Bangladesh's limited approach to performative arts, theatre has progressed, but still has a long way to go to overcome multiple obstacles standing in its way.

Mohsina Akhter has been involved in the theatre scene since 2005 when she enrolled in Dhaka University's drama department. Currently, she works as a theatre director, actor, designer, and lecturer at Tagore University of Creative Arts (TUCA) and as adjunct faculty at the Department of Theatre and Performance Studies at the University of Dhaka.

""Intellectual and physical analysis portrayed in theatre teaches us to understand life. Character analysis and development allow us to get to know ourselves through the journey the characters undertake in every act,"" says Mohsina Akhter.

She further adds, ""Unfortunately, until now, there is limited opportunity to choose theatre as a profession in Bangladesh. Everyone involved in theatre has to do something else to survive and this is an obstacle in its development.""

Theatre is very distinct from television and other forms of media because there is no intermediary between the actors and the audience. There is no screen or middleman conveying the story to its audience allowing the viewers to relate with the plot, characters and setting directly and interpret the story. The ability of theatre to illustrate commonplace struggles, chores, and emotions to the audience is its most compelling feature and is one best resonated through audience interaction and reaction.

While there are many challenges within the business, the audience sheds hope. In Mohsina's opinion, ""The new generation is eager to see theatre differently."" To her, this is one of the more positive things in the scene currently which assures her that a solution to the existing challenges will emerge.

She further elaborates, ""While this generation is addicted to social media and their attention span is very short, I do not think it should affect theatre. Watching theatre is a practice and there are many countries where this practice is prevalent.""

One of the obstacles standing in the way of theatre expansion is the availability of halls. Mohsina states, ""Currently, Bangladesh's theatre is in a very critical condition. We don't have enough stages or money. Teams are trying to make plays with their own pocket money. Ticket prices have to be kept very low; so, it does not compensate for the production expenses. Furthermore, there is also a lack of professional skills.""

While Mohsina's view on theatre as a full-time career reflects a specific group of people trying to pave their path, theatre has gradually gained more mainstream attention, with more people actively looking to theatre as a full-time career and audiences being more enthused to watch these performances.

In 2017, Mahjabeen Chowdhury and M Arifur Rahman founded Open Space Theatre, based on their combined experience of two decades in the theatre field. Since then, they have staged more than 74 performances in front of 20,000 plus spectators, created multiple productions, and conducted numerous acting workshops to develop new actors to keep the theatre sector booming as a profession and to enable others to build a career in this field.

Mahjabeen says, ""Open Space Theatre creates performances which are entertaining, organic and vivid to help the audience take that essential break and expand their overall perspective on life aspects.""

Since Open Space Theatre began working there have been more people, more performances, more occasions, and more conversations regarding theatre.

""Open Space Theatre has created an entire generation of audiences who have high standards regarding theatre. Other theatre practitioners who used to claim earlier that theatre audiences consist of only four to five thousand people have been proven wrong. Audiences have now become accustomed to purchasing our tickets even a month ahead of shows,"" Mahjabeen explains. ""Before we came into the picture, they were comfortable with empty halls and blaming the audience for not appreciating theatre. Now, at least they are attempting to figure out ways to survive and make efforts to be relevant.""

""The abilities required to create a theatre group, provide leadership, and establish the team's financial stability require years of practice. It is a profession for those with unwavering passion and exceptional ability. This is not a place where everyone will succeed,"" Mahjabeen elaborates, while talking about how far Open Space Theatre established itself as the first and only professional theatre troupe in Dhaka.

Given the challenges and the effort required to make theatre one's singular career, Open Space has created a platform in which individuals can invest their undivided time and energy, passion and interest, and hone the artform. Due to this effort, over the years, the audience has now become attracted to theatre performances and find relevance through their mesmerising acting and storytelling.

Mahjabeen goes further to advise and encourage those who are interested in theatre, to first invest their time in learning the craft.

Mahjabeen goes on to give a more argumentative perspective when talking about theatre halls, saying, ""Theatre Hall rents are heavily subsidised by our government, but the hall allocation process is somewhat biased and not based on criteria such as production quality or audience demand.""

Despite having the immense support of audiences and a group of people dedicated to production, Mahjabeen goes on to point out that there is still a lack of substantial contribution from the journalists or media in diligently promoting theatre.

A career in theatre boils down to one's passion and dedication to the art. ""Theatre is becoming more relevant day by day. Its reach is growing and its importance is felt by those who experience it. Whatever the future brings, I am hopeful that theatre will keep our lives interesting,"" says Mahjabeen optimistically.

Overall, there are challenges which exist in the theatre field. However, with dedication, passion and hard work, it is possible to build on this artform and mould it into a career with fruitful outcomes for everyone involved.

Visit art museums

This might seem like an obvious choice but it's actually a great way, especially for beginners to experience a variety of art styles in one place. You can learn a lot about the history, the mediums of art and the techniques of different artists. You can learn about specific artists that you like and their techniques and context about their artworks.

Places like the National Art Gallery and Zainul Abedin, to name a few, are great places to take inspiration from.

Attend art festivals and exhibitions

Bangladesh always had and still has a vibrant and rich art culture. The arts have played a central role in the cultural identity of Bangladesh. That's why there are a lot of excellent art exhibitions happening almost all year round. Shilpakala Academy and Charukala are exhibition hotspots as they're always celebrating some form of art. It's a good way to explore more themes and open up your mind to all the divergent styles of art that exist.

Supporting local artists

There are so many talented young artisans who are coming up with the most unique and mesmerising artwork. You can support them by promoting their work on social media, visiting their studios and exhibitions and if you're really drawn to a specific artist or artists, purchasing their work enables them to work on more projects. This is a really great way of appreciating them and the hard work they put into their art.

105,Autumn Sonata and the portrayal of the complexities in a mother-daughter relationship,"My first encounter with Bergman's work was through the film Summer with Monika, which piqued my interest in his screenplays. Subsequently, in a short time frame, I proceeded to watch a number of his films, including Wild Strawberries, Scenes from a Marriage, Persona, and Winter Light among others. Despite my appreciation for his work, none impacted me as profoundly as Autumn Sonata.

Describing the relationship between a mother and daughter in words can prove to be a challenging task. Syed Shamsul Haque says to writers that we may find our feelings to be indescribable but, in our inability, to express our thoughts lies the potential to create great literature.

Ingmar Bergman's Autumn Sonata is a dialogue-driven film and explores the story of a complicated reunion between a great concert pianist named Charlotte and her daughter, Eva. Eva leads a quiet and austere life caring for her disabled sister Helena, although holding profound animosity toward her mother. During a stressful evening, the two ladies engage in a series of emotionally intense confrontations, revealing unpleasant facts about their pasts and their relationships with one another. The film delves into issues such as maternal neglect, remorse, and the enigmatic nature of forgiveness, culminating in a disturbing and cathartic final sequence.

Among all the relationships that exist in our world, the bond between a mother and her child is widely regarded as one of the purest forms of affection. As a daughter, I can confidently say that I love my mother deeply, and I am certain that she loves me in a similar manner. However, I have noticed that the dynamic between my mother and I is different from the one she shares with my brother.

It appears as though my mother perceives me as a woman rather than simply her child. Off the top of my head, I can name a few reasons as to why this happens – personality clashes, intergenerational differences, life stage differences, family history, and past experiences she had as a woman.

The societal construct in which she found herself prevented her from fully realising her potential, and instead placed upon her a set of responsibilities that she believed she wanted. As a woman, I understand the indoctrination that we undergo under the veil of maturation. Though it may be terrifying to consider, perhaps a part of her did not truly desire any of these responsibilities, like Charlotte. I believe something similar affected my upbringing.

Like Eva, I possess a deep love and reverence for my mother, but there persists a certain animosity that we willingly overlook. This is because addressing it would necessitate engaging in a difficult conversation with my mother, which I prefer to avoid, as years of accumulated emotions are laced with denial. If it is an apology that I am seeking, it is off the table.

To comprehend my mother as a woman and to comprehend her as my mother are two distinct yet intertwining feats. One allows me to understand the trials she has faced and the persistence with which she overcame them. My mother, as a woman, is a true source of inspiration to me, and her journey illuminates the path towards my own aspirations. However, understanding her as only my mother adds a layer of complexity. It encompasses the intricacies of our unique bond, built upon a lifetime of shared experiences, memories, and emotions.

Ingmar Bergman brilliantly balances the conflicting emotions of love and hate within the relationship. Seeing this film through the eyes of a daughter has been overwhelming. Perhaps one day I will see it through the eyes of a mother, and if I do, I will update this review accordingly.

106,"Vodafone to fire 11,000 employees","Vodafone's announcement follows the axing this year of tens of thousands of jobs across the global tech sector, including Meta, Amazon and Google. Image: Collected

Vodafone, the British multinational telecom company, is planning to fire 11,000 employees over the next three years, as per a recent statement by the company's new CEO, Margherita Della Valle. According to Valle, Vodafone has been performing poorly lately, as such will sack over 10% of their current global workforce - which is about 104,000 employees as of last year.

""To consistently deliver, Vodafone must change,"" Della Valle, a Vodafone veteran, added in a statement. ""We will simplify our organisation, cutting out complexity to regain our competitiveness,"" said the Italian national, recently appointed CEO on a permanent basis after a short spell as interim boss.

Vodafone's announcement follows the axing this year of tens of thousands of jobs across the global tech sector, including by Facebook parent Meta, as soaring inflation weakened the economy.

Della Valle's predecessor Nick Read stepped down in early December after a four-year tenure marked by a steep fall in the company's share price. He left with Vodafone in talks over merging its UK operations with rival Three UK, owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. Media reports say a deal worth 15 billion ($18.7 billion) is close to completion.

Vodafone on Tuesday added that group revenue stood at 45.7 billion euros ($50 billion) in its financial year to the end of March, almost flat compared with 2021/22. It added that net profit surged to 11.8 billion euros from 2.2 billion, reflecting its part-disposal of the European mast division, Vantage Towers.

""We will be a leaner and simpler organisation, to increase our commercial agility and free up resources,"" the company said Tuesday. It announced, ""11,000 role reductions planned over three years, with both HQ and local markets simplification"".

Vodafone, which has more than 300 million mobile customers in Europe and Africa, is heavily focused on accelerating the rollout of 5G in the UK.

Vodafone is banking on the merger of its UK operations with Three to expand broadband connectivity to rural communities and small businesses. However, the rollout of faster 5G connectivity has been hampered by Britain's ban on the Chinese giant Huawei from involvement in the technology.",2023-05-17 11:22:09,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/vodafone-fire-11000-employees-3322506,2023-05-18 10:20:05,thedailystar
107,ChatGPT can now browse the internet,"It may just change everything we know about the web and may usher a major behavioural shift

OpenAI's popular chatbot ChatGPT keeps evolving - now it can browse the internet. Read on to find out more.

OpenAI's latest update to its powerful language model, GPT-4, has brought a new update that allows ChatGPT to access the vast knowledge and real-time information available online. This evolution marks a significant milestone in the field of artificial intelligence, empowering ChatGPT to generate more up-to-date and accurate responses across a wide range of topics, including recent events and advancements.

Previously, ChatGPT relied solely on its training data, which had a knowledge cutoff in 2021. While it demonstrated remarkable language generation capabilities, it often struggled to address queries related to current developments. The integration of internet browsing into ChatGPT's repertoire changes the game, bridging the gap between static training data and the ever-evolving nature of the world.

By connecting to the internet, ChatGPT gains access to an immense pool of information, enabling it to deliver intelligent and insightful answers backed by the latest facts and figures.",2023-05-16 16:21:31,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/chatgpt-can-now-browse-the-internet-3321806,2023-05-18 10:20:06,thedailystar
108,How to safeguard against 5 key threats to password security,"Simple passwords such as ‘123456’ are particularly vulnerable to breaches.

Every year, on the first Thursday of May, World Password Day is celebrated to raise awareness about the importance of password security, password-related cybersecurity threats, and the best practices users and organisations can employ to safeguard their passwords, and thus their systems.

Let us examine some of the most significant threats to password security:

Phishing

Phishing involves a hacker contacting a victim while posing as a legitimate representative of a trusted entity (such as a bank, government agency, educational institute etc.) to trick them into revealing their passwords and other sensitive information.

While many users are alert and aware of the dangers of phishing scams, they continue to evolve in their sophistication: from spear phishing (hackers targeting specific individuals while impersonating a close contact) to URL hijacking (creating false websites with nearly-identical domain names to trick visitors into entering their credentials) and more.

Brute Force Attacks

Brute force attacks involve hackers systematically trying out different password combinations until they can successfully gain access to an account or system.

Simple passwords (such as '123456', birthdays or other personal details about the user etc.) are particularly vulnerable to such attacks.

The methodology has evolved with Hybrid brute force attacks leveraging automated tools (including AI-powered tools) that can try thousands of password permutations in seconds.

Credential stuffing is a related form of cyber-attack wherein hackers use passwords stolen in one successful data breach to attempt to access different accounts of the same users. Reusing the same passwords (or variations) across multiple accounts makes users highly vulnerable to this.

Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

Man-in-the-Middle attacks are caused by poorly secured communication channels, wherein cyber-attackers intercept authentication messages between servers and clients.

The hacker monitors users logging into an insecure website. This login data is relayed to the hacker, who then redirects the user to a false website. Users navigate through this false website, believing they are securely accessing their data, while unwittingly feeding malicious actors their passwords and other sensitive details.

Keylogging

A more sophisticated method of password theft, keylogging involves hackers installing surveillance software onto user's devices (through malware, or through a USB drive or keyboard attachment directly connected to the device) to record every keystroke the user makes. This enables the hacker to derive the users' passwords and other confidential information.

Password Spraying

Account lockouts are an important tool in the fight to ensure password security. Password spraying has emerged as a method developed by hackers to counteract this safeguard.

Most account lockouts are triggered by making too many login attempts during a short time. Hackers exploit this by trying the same password across multiple websites, before trying the next possible password. By the time the hacker has exhausted all the websites on their list and circled back to the first website with a new password, the lockout policy has reset and the previous failed attempt is not counted. In this manner, hackers can make a much greater number of attempts to crack passwords and gain access to accounts.

How to enhance password security?

Human users are unfortunately a significant weak link in the chain of password security. At an organisational level, there is a need to rigorously enforce policies around password generation, management and use. Users should use short and simple word and character combinations, or personal details, as passwords. More complex passwords, including auto-generated passwords, will provide a much stronger defence against brute force attacks.

Users should also maintain constant vigilance about possible phishing scams and verify the legitimacy of any individual with whom they communicate and/or any website or app that they visit, before sharing or entering any confidential information.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides an additional layer of security to accounts, frustrating hackers' attempts to gain unauthorised access even if passwords are compromised. The use of password managers, to generate and securely store complex passwords in an organised and encrypted manner, further elevates password security in addition to offering users a more frictionless experience.

The ramifications of poor password security can be severe for individuals and organisations – from account takeovers by malicious actors, to the compromise of sensitive data. Thus, it is critical to take effective measures to enhance password security.",2023-05-16 14:05:51,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/how-safeguard-against-5-key-threats-password-security-3321746,2023-05-18 10:20:08,thedailystar

110,How to keep your online information safe,"In today's age of technology, a lot of our personal information is stored online, including but not limited to your home address, passport number, credit card information, and even your exact real-time location. Some websites and online services also track, collect and store your browsing habits, IP address, and what kind of devices you use - data that can be used for targeted advertising regardless of your consent. Because personal data can be stored almost anywhere on the internet, it is imperative to keep all that valuable information safe at all times. As such, here are some basic but important things to keep in mind.

Enhance your passwords

If you're using the same password or different variations of the same password across multiple accounts or devices, you should consider changing that; as reusing passwords tend to increase security risk for your personal information. Furthermore, having a strong password for your online profiles is the safest way to avoid a security breach. A good approach to this is to combine capital letters, numbers, and symbols such as '!' and '@' to make your password as complex as you can - while still ensuring you remember it for future use.

Enable two-factor authentication

Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on top of a strong password will make your online accounts extra secure against malicious attempts. Popular online services such as Google and Facebook has 2FA options, where you can add a second verification step that will send a unique one-time code to your mobile phone or connected device.

Avoid phishing

This should be obvious, but if you're a regular internet user who likes to browse a lot, be sure to avoid suspicious links in websites or emails. Normally, email services such as Gmail will filter suspicious messages as spam, but you should still keep an eye out for any phishing attempt that may go unnoticed by the AI. A good way of identifying safe websites is to look out for the padlock symbol on the address bar. This icon indicates an SSL certificate, which means the link is encrypted and will not risk exposing your information to third parties.

Stay encrypted

When you're browsing online, make sure you're using an encrypted link - with 'HTTPS' at the beginning of the link in the address bar. Websites with HTTPS are generally more secure and have the aforementioned padlock icon, which means your information is safe. Additionally, you can use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet connection further. While the best VPN services are premium, if you feel your data is at risk, consider using one, especially when connected to public Wi-Fi.

Review privacy settings

If you use the same online account across multiple devices and haven't reviewed your privacy settings in a while, this might be a good time to do so. Be extra sure of what kind of information is being shared across your connected devices, especially social media accounts such as Facebook and Instagram which may be using your personal data to send targeted ads. Smartphone apps sometimes also require permission for your contact info, so be sure to remove such permissions from apps you feel aren't necessary.

Keep your devices updated

Vulnerable, outdated software always runs the risk of being hacked. Fortunately, operating systems of both smartphones and computers receive regular security updates to patch potential flaws and risks. If you want to keep your data safe, you should be on top of these updates, especially for apps that are using your personal information. You can also set your devices to install these updates automatically - though manual updates are fine too if you don't use Wi-Fi too often.

Try adblockers

There are plenty of adblockers and similar browser extensions available on both web and mobile browsers. You should try them out if you're worried about your data being used for targeted advertising. Not only do these adblockers not show you ads on certain sites, but they also don't allow most sites to collect your browsing data, thus improving your browsing privacy. You can also try out adblocker browsers such as Brave, Avast Secure Browser and Epic Privacy Browser.",2023-05-15 09:50:42,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/how-keep-your-online-information-safe-3320701,2023-05-18 10:20:10,thedailystar
111,Google I/O 2023: The major announcements from the tech giant,"Google uses Google I/O to reveal its upcoming projects and plans every year. Tech enthusiasts and supporters of the Google ecosystem will no doubt be buzzing with excitement after this year's event, which featured many exciting announcements. Google has a tonne of new products and updates in store for us, from foldable smartphones to new AI-powered features.

Google Pixel Fold

The eagerly anticipated Google Pixel Fold foldable smartphone has finally been unveiled. It folds like a book, similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. It resembles the Samsung foldable phones in many ways, but with the distinctive styling we've come to expect from the most recent Pixel line.

The eagerly anticipated Google Pixel Fold foldable smartphone has finally been unveiled.

The now iconic Pixel camera bar is present on the rear, while the front of the phone looks quite similar to the Pixel 7 Pro, with slim bezels and a centrally placed hole-punch selfie camera. The full HD+ 5.8-inch OLED external display on the Google Pixel Fold has a 17.4:9 aspect ratio, a resolution of 2092 x 1080 pixels, and a refresh rate of up to 120 Hz. While there are visibly chunky forehead and chin bezels, they'll be useful for holding the phone while in the unfolded mode.

Three cameras are located in a bar on the device's back: a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.8-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 10.8-megapixel telephoto camera with a 5x optical zoom and 20x Super Res Zoom. In contrast, the front-facing camera has 9.5 megapixels.

The Tensor G2 chip used in the Pixel Fold and the Pixel 7 range is the same. It will be interesting to see how well it holds up when placed in the much larger Pixel Fold. Storage options include 256 GB and 512 GB, and the battery has a negligibly small capacity of 4,821mAh.

Google Pixel 7a

Though there are a few significant visual differences, the Pixel 7a and Pixel 7 look very similar.

The Google Pixel 7a, has now been made public. It's a slightly scaled-down version of the flagship Pixel 7, as was to be expected, but it doesn't sacrifice processing speed or camera quality. The Google Tensor G2 processor in the Pixel 7a is identical to that in its flagship cousins.

Though there are a few significant visual differences, the Pixel 7a and Pixel 7 look very similar. There is no wireless charging, the display has a slightly lower resolution, and the rear camera module is smaller. The Pixel 7a does, however, have a few benefits over the flagship model. It has a headphone jack, a slightly bigger 6.2-inch display, and a bigger battery.

Google Pixel Tablet

The Google Pixel Tablet is a new addition to the Google Pixel lineup of devices.

The Google Pixel Tablet is a new addition to the Google Pixel lineup of devices. It's a 10.95-inch LCD display tablet with a 2560 x 1600 resolution that is optimised for multimedia content. With four speakers, users can enjoy a surround sound experience while watching movies or TV shows. The tablet is also designed to be easy to hold, thanks to its nano-ceramic coating.

The device has a USB-C port for charging and data transfer, as well as a headphone jack for a more personal audio experience. It also has a 12-megapixel camera on the back and an 8-megapixel camera on the front.

AI in Gmail

Google is always pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning, and AI was the big theme at I/O this year.

Google is always pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning, and AI was the big theme at I/O this year. One of the most significant announcements was the update to Gmail's AI features. Gmail has always been on the cutting edge of AI, with suggestions and Smart Replies leading the way. But now, with the new Help Me Write feature, Gmail will be able to create entire replies for users.

Help Me Write works by analysing the content of an email and suggesting responses based on that content. Users can then select a response and send it without ever having to type a single word.

The feature is particularly useful for customer service emails, where users often have to provide detailed information about an issue. Help Me Write can scan previous emails to provide important context and order information, making it easier to resolve customer issues quickly.

Workspace

You can now type in the kind of visualisation you're looking for and the AI will generate it, using the new features for Slides and Meet.

In order to make Google's Workspace suite smarter, automatic table generation (but not formula generation) in Sheets and image creation in Slides and Meet have both been added. You can now type in the kind of visualisation you're looking for and the AI will generate it, using the new features for Slides and Meet. This specifically refers to custom backgrounds for Google Meet.

Google Maps

Google Maps is another Google app that is receiving significant AI updates.

Google Maps is another Google app that is receiving significant AI updates. At Google I/O 2023, the company announced Immersive View for routes, a new feature that allows users to see their routes in 3D.

Users in select cities will be able to zoom along a 3D-generated simulation of their route allowing them to see landmarks along the way from a bird's-eye view. Immersive View will even generate traffic amounts depending on how busy it expects the route to be at that time and insert the correct weather.

Immersive View for routes will be rolled out later this year to 15 cities, including New York, San Francisco, London, and Tokyo. This new feature will give users a unique and immersive way to explore their city and plan their routes, making it a great addition to the already impressive Google Maps app.

Text-to-music

A new AI tool called MusicLM can convert text descriptions into music.

A new AI tool called MusicLM can convert text descriptions into music. Users can type in prompts like ""create an industrial techno sound that is hypnotic"" or ""create soulful jazz for a dinner party"" to use MusicLM, which is available in the AI Test Kitchen app on the web, Android, or iOS.

As they hone their MusicLM-generated works, users can specify the instruments they want to use, such as ""classical"" or ""electronic,"" as well as the ""vibe, mood, or emotion"" they want to convey.

Magic Editor

With the power of AI, Magic Editor can do much more than just erase objects.

Google Photos is also getting a significant AI-powered update with the new Magic Editor feature. Magic Editor is essentially a supercharged version of the Magic Eraser tool that allows users to remove unwanted objects from their photos.

With the power of AI, Magic Editor can do much more than just erase objects. It can also recreate elements that have been cropped out of the original photo, making it easier to edit photos without compromising the composition.

The most impressive example of Magic Editor's capabilities showed the tool recreate a missing person in a photo using AI. With this new feature, users can expect more seamless photo editing capabilities than ever before.

Bard

Google Bard is now accessible in Japanese and Korean, with 40 additional languages following soon.

You'll soon be able to communicate with Google's AI and won't have gated access anymore. Google Bard is now accessible in Japanese and Korean, with 40 additional languages following soon.

Bard is also getting some additional helpful new features. Soon, you'll be able to instruct Bard to create a spreadsheet based on a set of criteria, export that spreadsheet directly into Google Sheets for your personal use, and then import it back into Bard.

AI-generated images are something we've seen before, but Google is taking things to the next level with Bard's new ability to generate images, thanks to Adobe. With the power of Adobe Sensei, Bard can generate high-quality images that look like they were created by a human artist. This opens up a world of possibilities for content creators and businesses who need high-quality, customised images quickly and easily.

Google I/O 2023 was packed with exciting announcements from Google. From the long-awaited Pixel Fold to the new Pixel Tablet, Google is continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

113,General Motors to recall 1 mln vehicles due to faulty airbags,"The recall covers 994,763 Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse, and GMC Acadia vehicles from the 2014 through 2017 model years with modules produced by ARC Automotive Inc.

General Motors, the American automobile manufacturer, has recently stated that it will recall nearly 1 million sports vehicles in the United States, citing the reason to be faulty airbags. The statement added that the inflator for the driver seat's airbag may explode when deployed, hence the sudden recall.

The recall covers 994,763 Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse, and GMC Acadia vehicles from the 2014 through 2017 model years with modules produced by ARC Automotive Inc. Dealers will replace the driver's airbag module.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said a driver in Michigan of a 2017 Chevrolet Traverse was in a crash in which the front-driver airbag inflator ruptured during deployment causing facial injuries.

An April 25 inspection confirmed that the front driver airbag inflator ruptured in the vehicle.

General Motors said it was still investigating the issue with the assistance of a third-party engineering firm. ""General Motors is taking this expanded field action out of an abundance of caution and with the safety of our customers as our highest priority,"" the Detroit automaker said.

The company said it was aware of two prior ruptures of ARC-manufactured airbag inflators in 2015 Chevrolet Traverse vehicles, and GM conducted two earlier small recalls of about 3,000 ARC inflators.

All three rupture events in Chevrolet Traverse vehicles involved the same inflator variant.

ARC noted in a letter made public Friday that no root cause for those ruptures has been identified by ARC or GM. ARC said it was assessing the scope of GM's recall.

War has a gender. As it tears through cities and homes carrying firearms and riding tanks, littering streets with wreckage and flooding rivers with corpses, we associate war with men. As it births new nations and identities, infusing generations with renewed hope and courage, we associate war with men. Be it guerillas, freedom fighters, intellectuals leading revolutions or politicians designing strategies, generational gender dynamics have placed men at the forefront of war. In the history of Bangladesh's liberation war against Pakistan, men are the protagonists, and while commemorating the three million lives lost in 1971, it is in the honour of the martyred men that the country's streets fill with garlands of marigolds and tuberoses. It is in remembrance of them that songs are composed, monuments are erected and holidays are observed.

On the other hand, as with other historical events and primarily wars, women's contribution to the 1971 war has been shockingly forgotten or misconstrued and oftentimes, blatantly denied. Women are predominantly remembered as victims of Pakistan's undeniable genocidal rape campaign, which by conservative estimates, claimed 400,000 victims. Bengali women faced severe violation and degradation at the hands of the Pakistani army; however, it was the deafening attention on their shame and assault from both a national and global audience that sidelined and diminished the role of other women in the fight for freedom. Therein lies the power of Jahanara Imam's Ekattorer Dinguli (1986), a poignant memoir which highlights the capacity of female resistance through the author's legacy, losses, and triumphs as a mother, wife, and political activist, over a journey of the months leading to Bangladesh's independence.

At first, Ekattorer Dinguli may seem like the musings of an upper class Bengali housewife, from Jahanara's frustrations at the lethargy of her househelp, to the constant attention her ailing father-in-law requires, to the often humorous temper trials she has to endure as the mother of two headstrong boys. However, we're quickly introduced to the fascinating and exemplary layers that make up Jahanara: her political activism which comes alive through the sheltering and mobilisation of freedom fighters, her social and cultural influence which unites generations across socio-economic groups for the country's independence, and the determination with which she meticulously documents history through her writings. What stays with readers is the force with which she loves and longs for her son, Rumi, an emotion so powerful it cannot be contained within the pages of her book, but spills out onto her readers as they join in her hope and heartbreak, especially in the face of the life-changing sacrifice she needs to make for her country's independence.

Yet, in the instances where women's contribution to war is recognized, it is done so usually in the form of their sacrifices or tolerance. They are almost always at the receiving end of the action, passively reacting (or not reacting) to it.

What is extraordinary about Jahanara Imam's story, and the different roles she undertakes both within her household and in politics, is the ease with which her multidimensionality coexists. Jahanara spends her mornings in the narrow streets of New Market, searching for fresh tilapia, jackfruits and mangoes for her mother's kitchen, while curfewed evenings are spent burying rifles and machine guns in her backyard. Days into the war, her house becomes a secret convergence point for pro-liberation participants, ranging from doctors and journalists to professors and lawyers. Jahanara is seen actively strategizing with them on how to mobilise freedom fighters, collecting and subsequently disseminating these blueprints across her networks. Despite her reservations about her son's participation in the war, from the early days of 1971, Jahanara is seen actively involved in helping Rumi mobilise fighters. Be it by flushing ingredients needed to make explosives, meticulously sewing money into the folds of guerillas' pants, or collecting and transporting necessities like medicine, cigarettes, and money for the battlefield, Jahanara proves that one need not be in the frontlines to fight a war. At the same time, she is seen preparing a menu of shami kabab, biryani, and cha to ensure her guests are well fed.

From a feminist perspective, Ekattorer Dinguli travels gracefully through the decades, translating into a relevant, educational, and crucial account of a woman's fight for her country. At a time when women's rights are severely compromised in Bangladesh, be it through the distressing exploitation of women in the garment industry, or the widespread violation of domestic workers, Imam shows the critical and indispensable role that women play in a country's advancement. Today, her story serves as a plea to those in positions of power in Bangladesh to hold space for women, and enable their mobilisation through equal opportunities and rights.

Perhaps it was the desperation for independence, and an innate survival instinct that expunged conventional gender dynamics and united both men and women in the quest for freedom and a new identity. Or perhaps it was Jahanara's socio-economic background—her being the only woman in an urban, upper class household of progressive men, which naturally propelled her participation in the war. Regardless of her financial and environmental advantages, Jahanara had the option to flee the war, like hundreds had done from within her community, but she chose to remain in Dhaka and actively partake in the country's political movements. Her story serves as a feminist reporter's pad—laying the foundation for how Bengali women can influence socio-political movements, transform a nation's history and shape its future, one that is especially pertinent today as women's voices get silenced, and they struggle to claim their space in light of the country's challenges.

The soul of Ekattorer Dinguli lies in the relationship between Jahanara and her son, Rumi; and in the love, yearning, and heartache that only a mother can feel for her child. Jahanara reaches for her son like she reaches for prayer: in moments of desperation, loss, fear, and chaos, to persuade, implore, reason and beg. The initial months of war take us through her most conflicting dilemma: choosing between her overwhelming love for her first-born and his devastating need to become a freedom fighter. Jahanara is destroyed by the war's dangers and potential outcomes on Rumi, however, his patriotism and relentless zeal for a liberated Bangladesh result in her hesitantly conceding and permitting him to join the Mukti Bahini, ultimately sacrificing her child for the sake of her country.

The endless tragedies within Ekattorer Dinguli, and the heavy and emotionally depleting prose, find respite in the interactions between Rumi and Jahanara. Like a window letting the light in, their exchanges infuse the book with humour, sunny anecdotes, fights over evening snacks and a giddy enthusiasm for a new flag, a new nation. The idyll of their relationship compels readers to participate in their dynamic; Jahanara's family becomes ours, and it immediately makes her personal loss universal.

In August of 1971, Rumi's successful assault on the Pakistan army results in his capture, subsequent disappearance and ultimate death, which remains unknown but largely understood by Jahanara and her family. Her husband, Sharif, and younger son, Jami, are also captured and extensively tortured by the Pakistani military before being ultimately returned. However, the shock of Rumi's arrest and the

lack of information on his whereabouts washes over Jahanara in waves of devastation and helplessness over the months leading to independence.

Despite her anguish and desperation as she searches for her son, while reluctantly accepting the possibility of his death, Jahanara continues participating in the war with sincerity. She dives into finding shelter for wounded fighters, hiding families in her mother's home, and transmitting relevant information across a network of revolutionaries. Rumi's death is an infinite loss, and hangs over her head like a dense, dark cloud; however, what is striking is her relentless courage as she continues to fight in the face of life-changing adversity, especially in the most crucial and precarious months leading to liberation. Unfortunately, Jahanara's reality as a mother is one shared by millions of women in 1971, which demonstrates the scale of Bangladeshi women's sacrifices and contribution to the war, be it as community organisers, messengers, guerilla fighters or martyred mothers and wives.

I first picked up Jahanara Imam's Ekattorer Dinguli at age 15, with apprehension and reluctance as it made its way to my Bangla class' mandatory reading list, unbeknownst to how the book would change my relationship with my country by showing me the forgotten legacy of women's contributions, on whose backs and wombs Bangladesh was made. Over the next 15 years, I came back to the book instinctively, intentionally, and subconsciously, sometimes to understand women, their resilience, courage and capacity to love, but mainly to return home to my mother. As someone whose entire existence is because of and for her mother, Jahanara's every breath, laced with her love and longing for Rumi laid out the blueprint of the lives of mothers, including my own. A love whose power defies all else, and a bond that can only be experienced and hardly explained, Jahanara's complete submission to her son, and utter helplessness in the face of his desires and duties, helped me see mothers for their bravery, their struggles and sacrifices, and unmatched perseverance while weathering losses, and all the love their hearts hold. Often one needs exactly that, a new perspective, a new voice to see what is hiding in plain sight, the gift of a mother's love that is incredibly tempting to take for granted. It was through the magic of her words that I unlearnt and relearnt of the treasures this relationship holds, the inexplicable joy and profound heartbreak of motherhood, and since then have used them to navigate a way back to my first country, my mother.

Ekattorer Dinguli forces one to acknowledge the dire reality of ethnic and religious violence, and the harsh legacy of colonial oppression and divide that has ruptured the fabric of the South Asian subcontinent since 1947, claiming millions of lives, and showing wider and deeper cracks through the years. In the case of Pakistan and Bangladesh, the book reveals Pakistan's prevalent oppression and brutality of the Bangladeshi people, which included among other tyrannies, an attempted erasure of the Bengali language, and its people. Jahanara Imam highlights the viciousness with which divides are perpetuated, and the hunger with which it claims lives within borders and across generations, religions, genders and class. Through her journey as a political activist and her loss as a mother, Ekattorer Dinguli shows that regardless of the outcomes of war, even ""winners"" straddle both joy and loss, hope and despair, ultimately, leaving no winners in war.

120,A glimpse of the Istanbul we don’t know,"‘10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World’ by Elif Shafak (Viking, 2019)

There is a difference between being hooked ""from"" the start of a book and being hooked ""by"" the start of it. 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World—Elif Shafak's 11th novel—does the latter.

""Her name was Leila. Tequila Leila as she was called at home and at work, in that rosewood-coloured house on a cobblestoned cul-de-sac down by the wharf, nestled between a church and a synagogue, among lamp shops and kebab shops—the street that harboured the oldest licensed brothels in Istanbul. Still, if she were to hear you put it like that, she might take offense and playfully hurl a shoe—one of her high-heeled stilettos."" In one short opening paragraph, we are thrown smack into the heart of a world, zooming past the frontier separating fact and fiction into a city and a neighbourhood ringing with its smells and sounds, its unique collage of landmarks. ""'Is, darling, not was...My name is Tequila Leila.'"" In one short sentence, our protagonist has come alive in tone, look, and personality, even as her body decays in a metal rubbish bin.

Several ideas coalesced to inspire Shafak for this novel. Known—and persecuted in Turkey—for her political activism against the state's collective amnesia and its oppression on free speech, women, and minorities, the British-Turkish author sought to give ""voice to the voiceless"" in this book, to portray the underbelly of an Istanbul not captured and promoted by the Ministry of Tourism. She was also intrigued by research collected from intensive care units in Canada, which found that the part of the brain in charge of memory functions for about 10 minutes even after clinical death. Shafak was interested in exploring what the mind recalls during this time; the extra 38 seconds would be Shafak's creative spin on the premise.

And so we open the novel to arrive at ""The End"" of Tequila Leila, a sex worker murdered and dumped in a trash can in the outskirts of Istanbul. But her mind is still at work. Advancing minutes at a time, the ensuing chapters transport Leila—and us—to pivotal moments of her past, each memory triggered by a sensory note. The taste of lemon, sugar, and childhood; the smell of sulphuric acid and abuse. A sheltered yet disturbed past in Van before Leila is swept up in love, friendship, history, and the highs and lows of life as a sex worker in a bustling, ruthless Istanbul. Interspersed amid these recollections are snatches of Leila's ""water family"", the friends Leila has traded in for her blood relatives, all pushed to the margins of society for one reason or another.

For a book that has such a clear agenda—to depict the marginalized—10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World manages for the most part not to be preachy. It is not activism you read in Shafak's pages. Part of this feat is accomplished by an original premise, and plot devices that are equally intriguing; the other is achieved by deeply compelling prose.

Realistically, we know that Leila will become only a statistic and a neglected one at that, given her place in society. However, the novel inserts you deep into Leila's heart. The flashbacks are tinged initially by nostalgia, but soon that melts away; the reel of events gains clarity and is infused only with a calm, bittersweet acceptance of what it means to experience this world. As a result, one can't help but be aware of Leila's specificity as a human being. Here was a woman who was but a dot amidst the throngs of people who watched the Bosphorus Bridge being opened in October 1973, as fireworks erupted over a Turkey that now seamed Asia to Europe. She was a dot, still, amidst the masses that had been shot in bulk at the International Workers' Day massacre in 1977. Yet in her memories we learn of even the beggars that had brimmed with joy seeing the bridge. As communism crept through Turkey in the 1970s, we watch Leila notice the politics of clothing and facial hair, and witness her life being upturned by the massacre on Taksim Square.

These events are all swept by Shafak's lilting, optimistic voice. The upside is that you want to crawl into the sentences and rest there as she paints a vivid and notorious Istanbul. The downside is that it dilutes some of the violence that meets Leila and her friends at every step of life. She refers to these friends recurrently as ""the five,"" and almost all of them are introduced in the same way: a chapter ending with their name, followed by the phrase, ""one of the five,"" and the following chapter offering a brief synopsis of their life. The repetition can get annoying. Given that the group comprises of a dwarf, a transgender, a bar singer working close to the brothels, a Somalian woman trafficked into Turkey for sex work, and a childhood friend of Leila's who leads a double life, it is believable that ostracism and internal conflict has led these people to gravitate towards each other. But their rendering still feels off—as if they've been tacked onto the story for token diversity—and one struggles to tell them apart. As the friends take over the novel once the 10 minutes are over, the spell of Shafak's prose is broken, like a plug yanked out of a brimming bathtub. The novel spirals into a comical, unrealistic climax.

What you retain is the flavour of Leila's compelling thoughts.

121,On mothers and reading,"I wonder at how these frugal, accessible pleasures define her daily existence and get elated with the fact that reading takes up a significant space on the shelf

These days, at the height of my semester break, I wake up at 12 PM, and have coffee—criminally indolently. I complain about the heat, the noise and the general air of unpleasantness in this city, and also about the fact that I don't write, and that I can't seem to get myself to do so.

My mother, having completed at least 50 tasks since morning, sits with her tea in a tulip glass while her brows digress. She politely moves on to tell me that I should wake up a little earlier. Dawns, donned in robes all rosy, are inexhaustible sources of inspiration, and early mornings the reservoir of Vitamin-D.

I agree, become visibly ashamed, and nervously ask her about what she has been up to. She breaks into a jazzy smile, proceeding to show me the orange dahlias flaunting themselves like proud lion heads at our balcony, accompanied by the boisterous tap-dance of the fat sparrows stopping for a drink.

Halfway through a Dev Anand song, we share what we have read the night before. I talk of Byatt through Barthes's praxis and how it all goes over my head. She tells me about how she had been slipping into states of dreamless torpor 30 minutes into the audiobook of Akshay Mulberry for the past three nights. We giggle.

I wonder at how these frugal, accessible pleasures define her daily existence and get elated with the fact that reading takes up a significant space on the shelf. Now, I break into a jazzy smile.

When I think of my mother in connexion to books or storytelling, disparate images slowly come into an embrace with one another like water bridges in a landscape painting. Some are sentimental like the smell of her lap in starched cotton saree while my head wafts with the heady shenanigans of Princess Vasilisa and such from Ukrainian folklore; others are more specific—appearing as bold strokes dominated by silhouettes of the characters or plots which enamour her.

I no longer remember when exactly she first guided my vision to be at awe with Patricia from Remarque's Three Comrades, who appears as a tragic figurine afflicted with lung haemorrhage and is sketched to be the paragon of grace, beauty, and love in the brutal post-war setting of the text. My mother, after an episode of reducing the novel to a set of unpleasant power structures and tired tropes, inevitably and ardently pulls it back up as an object of harmony by admiring the exquisiteness in it, portrayed through the explorations of themes such as camaraderie and love in the face of poverty and brutality.

And thus in my mind, nuance was created: Patricia appeared to be as a being of transient cloud-like instants, misty and melancholic, scythed by moonlight; yes, perhaps underdeveloped and outdated but beautifully done so.

Under a different tonal palette altogether, my mother's Marxist forays would often result in the introductions of authors in my diet, who slice our hearts open with their merciless observations and remind us of the varied viscosities of human existence. It was often her impassioned exclaims of misery and swift hand gestures which made me feel in my guts, Kushum's intentional stomps over Shashi Doctor's flower beds due to years of unreciprocated affection in Manik Bandopadhay's Putul Naacher Iteekotha, or Manto's metaphor of comparing the clandestine love affairs in the film industry as predatory ""Khamchakhamchi"" of jungle cats.

Virginia Woolf, in her essay ""Hours in the Library"", differentiates between the man who loves learning and the man who loves reading. She presents the latter subject as someone who is full of intense curiosities, to whom ""reading is more of the nature of brisk exercise in the open air that of sheltered study"", as opposed to the scholar to whom reading is often a sedentary, sunless pursuit.

Once on a walk around the streets of Kolkata I noticed the Romantic notion of the reader, as put forward by Woolf. It peered its head up in my mother, perfectly and palpably. As my senses stood stultified in the vegetative humidity, she let out a gasp upon coming across an address nameplate. Carved on a piece of white marble, the plate proudly stated that Kazi Nazrul Islam had resided in that particular building around 1929. It was a sight impeccably tender, somewhat odd: my mother weeping while the slight traces of the flaky meat pastries consumed earlier glistened like confetti in the golden haze of twilight. I felt our lazy trot manifest into a literary pilgrimage while she let out invocations in the name of the poet and the red of life.

As my mother pours down sugar to the incense bowl, she reminisces how she had named me after Joyeeta from Samaresh Majumdar's Gorbhodharini. She is moved and always perceptibly so, while talking of literature, and their magnificence, the disgust, and the pangs which deliver us.

I sigh thinking of the author's death last week. As the bubbles on the kitchen sink guzzle and plop, my mother smiles and talks about how joyous it is to have someone whose entire life's works are accessible to us.

I ponder on that. I realise, through her, time and time again that books and literature are life itself, joy itself—a surefire way to navigate oneself through worldly anxieties and towards a safe space of fluffy, cerebral delights.

122,'One-Punch Man' manga returns after hiatus,"""One-Punch Man"" is returning with a web-comic--the original source material for the manga and the anime.

For more than a decade, the wildly popular series captured the hearts of millions because of its quirky humour and loveable main character. Now, fans have a reason to celebrate again, as the hiatus finally ends, meaning fans have more of Saitama's antics to look forward to.

While the creator of the ""One Punch Man"" franchise, ONE, was occupied with other projects, he recently rediverted his attention to the series that helped him make his claim to fame. After concluding the ""Mob Psycho 100"" anime earlier this year, plus the official announcement of ""One-Punch Man"" Season 3, ONE has returned to his original series with new chapters planned for the webcomic.

The last chapter was released back in 2021, leaving many a fan anxious about when they would get more of Saitama's story. There were no official updates in place, but now thankfully ONE has brought the webcomics back for long time fans.

The story of Saitama is unlike any other. An average looking person with an extraordinary power, he can beat any foe--humans, demons, monsters and even robots--with just one punch. His only problem? The lack of motivation. All he can look forward to is the dreams of fighting a foe he can punch more than once.",2023-05-16 13:14:33,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/one-punch-man-manga-returns-after-hiatus-3321706,2023-05-18 10:20:26,thedailystar

124,A gripping portrayal of one of Greek mythology’s most strong-willed women,"‘Clytemnestra’ by Costanza Casati (Michael Joseph, 2023)

One of the most controversial figures in Greek mythology is Clytemnestra, a Spartan princess and the queen of Mycenae. Despite being antagonised by many and sympathised by few, her dominance and influence remain uncontested. Costanza Casati's latest novel, titled after its heroine, provides a dynamic and complex portrayal of the queen. Known for her strong-willed, ambitious, and calculating nature, Clytemnestra is written as a layered, multi-faceted human being.

As the oldest daughter and the favourite child of Tyndareus, the King of Sparta, Clytemnestra is spirited, sharp, and unyielding. She is devoted to her family and fiercely protective of her sister, Helen. She also lacks the general bashfulness and prudishness associated with ""good"" women, exceeding expectations while still having to yield to the societal situations and decorums restraining women. Her lack of regard for rules makes her reckless, yet admirable.

Divided into five parts, the novel focuses on different phases of Clytemnestra's life. The first part opens with a teenage Clytemnestra hunting down a lynx, drawing light on her upbringing being equal to that of her brothers. She is shown to be lively, quick, and courageous; almost to a fault. Clytemnestra's rearing influences her decisions and actions throughout the novel. We learn of Clytemnestra's first marriage to Tantalus, the King of Maeonia, in this retelling. It is almost as if he is written as an antithesis to Agamemnon, Clytemnestra's second husband, who is introduced in the second part alongside his brother, Menelaus.

Throughout the rest of the parts, we observe her as an able ruler of Mycenae while her husband fights the Trojan War. As readers, we also witness her ferocities that are little associated with the common understanding of a ""just"" ruler. We see her as a loving mother, while also finding the fallibilities of motherhood flawlessly seamed into the storytelling.

Is Casati's take on Clytemnestra a feminist portrayal? Yes, it is as authentic a feminist portrayal as it can get, because it is not impossibly idealistic. Throughout the novel, we witness Clytemnestra's fortitude not to bend to patriarchal dominations and machinations, despite having to often submit. She uses her position to protect women and admonish those who have chosen to make her an enemy. We see her falter and accept the need for patience, tolerance, and compromises in certain circumstances. Through Clytemnestra's eyes, we see some of the women of Greek mythology and sympathise with them. The woman we find the most perspective on is Helen, later the queen of Sparta. While much of Greek mythology focuses on Helen's unparalleled beauty and her abduction/elopement, here Casati fleshes out Helen's character further and scrutinises her motivations behind the actions that shape Greek mythology.

The book spans over 400 pages and, not once becomes tedious or superfluous. However, the fast-paced nature of the text takes away from the gravity of certain situations, which with richer details, could have had a lasting impact. While the story itself stands to be memorable, the abrupt nature of the climax leaves little room for afterthought. Nevertheless, despite the novel being an easy read, Casati does a brilliant job of tackling the cultural differences between Sparta and Mycenae, especially when it comes to the treatment of women. From a teenage huntress to an able ruler of Mycenae, from a loving mother to a murderer, we see all the facets of Clytemnestra's personality probed to the core.

Yet the novel isn't just engaging on its own. It also provides a successful dose of retelling that Greek mythology enthusiasts will likely enjoy. It is safe to say that Casati's debut novel shows promise and leaves more to be anticipated.

125,There’s a new book out soon. Is it by Taylor Swift or BTS?,"The guessing game began a few days ago, when an anonymous, untitled book scheduled for July 9, ""4C Untitled Flatiron Nonfiction Summer 2023"", had Taylor Swift fans so convinced she had written a memoir that they made it a bestseller.

By Thursday, the Swift rumors had been refuted and the mystery resolved: Flatiron Books announced the upcoming release of a book by another musical powerhouse, BTS.

Beyond the Story: 10-Year Record of BTS is 544 pages, according to the publisher, written by the journalist Myeongseok Kang and structured like an oral history about the K-Pop boy band. It has been translated into English by Anton Hur, in collaboration with Clare Richards and Slin Jung.

Details about the book had encouraged fans of Swift and BTS. The author and subject were to be revealed June 13, a favorite number of Swift's, but also the 10th anniversary of BTS' first single, ""No More Dream"". The page count numbers, 5-4-4, also add up to 13. The publication date, July 9, is close to the release date of Swift's album ""Speak Now (Taylor's Version),"" but it's also ARMY day, the 10th anniversary of the founding of BTS' ARMY fan base.

Speculation about the book's subject made it a bestseller on Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble's website.

Booksellers had been informed of a major release from Flatiron, which billed the work as a ""fun, celebratory title"" that would skew to ""slightly younger"" audiences. The book, a Flatiron sales official emailed sellers, would have ""global appeal"" and ""massive publicity.""",2023-05-12 04:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/daily-star-books/news/theres-new-book-out-soon-it-taylor-swift-or-bts-3317641,2023-05-18 10:20:30,thedailystar
126,"Tough choices, terrifying consequences","‘I Did It For You’ by Jayne Cowie (Penguin, 2023)

As any good parent can tell you, parenting invariably involves some pretty tough choices. And while we are bombarded with media images that show happy, well-adjusted children and the equally joyous adults around them partaking in wholesome delights ranging from a cosy, home-cooked meal at a family dining table to outings at theme parks and foreign holidays, the day-to-day caregiving kids require is rather less glamorous.

And always, always, always, there is the guilt about whether you are spending enough time with your children, sending them to the right schools, giving them the right food, spoiling them too much or not spoiling them enough, and so on, in a never-ending series of questions and an ongoing attempt to give your children the best possible start in life.

How much harder would that already-challenging process be if there was a possibility that your child's entire future could hinge upon the results of a single genetic test? Jayne Cowie's book, I Did It For You, tells us just that.

The narrative is frighteningly plausible, and raises major ethical and social issues, beyond the already-complex minefield of parenting successes and shortcomings.

In a world that is easily recognisable as ours, a major scientific breakthrough has ensured that boys born with a particular gene can be identified as having the potential to grow into violent men. This gene, known as M+, can be identified in baby boys with the use of a simple DNA swab of the mouth.

While the discovery has implications that could bring about widespread positive changes in society—particularly with regard to reducing domestic violence—it quickly leads to a split among those who support the test versus those who find the idea invasive or problematic.

Nevertheless, within the space of just a handful of years, the test begins to determine the fate of young boys. Everything is affected—their access to schools, careers, relationships and, perhaps most importantly, how they are judged by the adults around them.

In this story, we are introduced to two sisters, both of whom give birth to boy children. That too, quite close in age. Antonia is the wife of a doctor, Owen, and a mother who coddles her son, Jack, to a degree that her sister, Bea, considers ridiculous. Antonia also chooses to have her son tested. Jack turns out to be M-, and does not carry the dangerous gene.

Sensing the money-making potential of this social shift, Antonia and her husband Owen subsequently decide to open a clinic for M+ boys, and become very wealthy in the process as rich desperate parents seek a way out of the situation that their sons are likely to face as they get older.

By contrast, Bea and her partner Alfie decide, on principle, not to have their son Simon tested. But this leads to years of a situation where Simon is effectively treated as M+ by default, as he does not have a test result that can prove otherwise. Bea's social circumstances are the opposite of Antonia's, and the two boys each have access to a very different set of resources as a result of this.

Nevertheless, the cousins remain close. But as Simon and Jack approach adulthood, years of closely-held family secrets and the very different choices made by their mothers begin to play out in a dangerous fashion. And Cowie delivers twist after twist of storytelling magic that really makes you question what choice you would make under this terrible set of circumstances.

While fathers' decisions, and their consequences, are very much part of the story, at its heart, this book is about the sacrifices that mothers make for their children—and what being a good mother really means.

The narrative is frighteningly plausible, and raises major ethical and social issues, beyond the already-complex minefield of parenting successes and shortcomings.

Cowie has delivered a gripping read which engages the reader's interest until the last page—particularly since the story goes turbo, hitting its stride (and how!), in the last few chapters. If you want a breathtakingly engaging read with just one speculative element, this is definitely a book worth reading.

127,Illegal brick kilns: HC summons N'ganj DC for noncompliance,"The High Court today summoned the deputy commissioner of Narayanganj and two other high officials over noncompliance of its directives regarding demolishing all the illegal brick kilns in Narayanganj

The HC bench of Justice KM Kamrul Kader and Justice Mohammad Showkat Ali Chowdhury directed them to appear before it on May 31 and explain why illegal brick kilns were not shut down despite its repeated directives.

The two other officials are director (enforcement) of Department of Environment (DoE) and deputy director of DoE (Narayanganj).

""It has been found from the documents that one of the owners has been jailed for a month for operating illegal brick kilns while other such offenders have only been fined. There might have under-table-dealings among officials and the owners of illegal brick kilns,"" the HC bench said during the hearing of a petition filed by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh seeking necessary directives.

The court said several contempt of court rules have been issued against many secretaries and deputy commissioners for not complying with its directives regarding the illegal brick kilns.

Writ petitioner's lawyer Manzill Murshid told the HC bench that despite contempt of court rules against the high officials of the government by the HC, appropriate action was not taken.

The HC bench said if they (government high officials) are directed to appear before this court for explanations over noncompliance of directives, they end up going to the prime minister's office as they are very powerful.

What is the benefit of court orders if not implemented? the court asked.

With these comments, the bench summoned the three government officials.

DoE's lawyer Amatul Karim Swapna told The Daily Star that the DoE has demolished one illegal brick kiln and shut down operations of 10 others in Narayanganj in compliance with the HC orders.

The HC issued the summon orders as all the illegal brick kilns were not demolished, she said.

The DoE's lawyer also said the government officials cannot comply with the HC orders as the owners of brick kilns moved appeals before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court against the HC orders.",2023-05-17 16:52:09,https://www.thedailystar.net/environment/news/illegal-brick-kilns-hc-summons-nganj-dc-noncompliance-3322706,2023-05-18 10:20:33,thedailystar
128,World soon likely to see 1.5C of warming: WMO,"A southeast Greenland polar bear on glacier, or freshwater, ice is seen in this handout photograph taken in September 2016. Representational image: Reuters

For the first time ever, global temperatures are now more likely than not to breach 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7F) of warming within the next five years, the World Meteorological Organization said today.

But that did not necessarily mean the world would cross the long-term warming threshold of 1.5C above preindustrial levels set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement.

With a 66 percent chance of temporarily reaching 1.5C by 2027, ""it's the first time in history that it's more likely than not that we will exceed 1.5C,"" said Adam Scaife, head of long-range prediction at Britain's Met Office Hadley Centre who worked on the WMO's latest Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update.

Last year's report put the odds at about 50-50.

Partially responsible for boosting the chance of hitting 1.5C is an El Niño weather pattern expected to develop in the coming months. During this natural phenomenon, warmer waters in the tropical Pacific heat the atmosphere above, spiking global temperatures.

The El Niño ""will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory"", said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas in a press statement.

Still, the likelihood of temporarily exceeding 1.5C has increased over time. Between 2017 and 2021, for example, scientists estimated just a 10 percent chance of hitting 1.5C.

Unlike the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's climate projections which are based on future greenhouse gas emissions, the WMO update provides more of a prediction-based long-range weather forecast.

The WMO also found a 98 percent chance that one of the next five years will be the hottest on record, surpassing 2016 which saw global temperature impacted by about 1.3C (2.3F) of warming.",2023-05-17 11:55:55,https://www.thedailystar.net/environment/climate-change/news/world-soon-likely-see-15c-warming-wmo-3322531,2023-05-18 10:20:34,thedailystar
129,Rohingya children in Cox's Bazar camps faced brunt of Cyclone Mocha: Unicef,"One million Rohingya refugees living in the Cox's Bazar refugee camp, half of whom are children, faced the brunt of Cyclone Mocha, said Unicef yesterday.

Children reside in the fragile temporary shelters in the camps, which are particularly vulnerable to mudslides, it also claimed.

Catherine Russell, executive director of Unicef, said, ""Some of the world's most vulnerable children and families are, yet again, at the sharp end of a crisis they didn't create. The areas hit hardest by the storm are home to communities already living through conflict, poverty, instability, and climate and environmental shocks.

""As we urgently assess and respond to the immediate needs of children in the aftermath of this cyclone, we know with certainty that the best way to save and improve the lives of children and their families is by finding long-term solutions,"" he added.

On May 14, Cyclone Mocha hit Bangladesh and Myanmar, bringing torrential rain, storm surges, and winds of up to 175 mph.

According to Unicef, the refugee camps are among the world's most densely populated areas, placing children in danger from sickness, malnutrition, neglect, exploitation, and violence.

Besides, it noted that the situation is particularly worrisome in Myanmar. More than 16 million people -- 5.6 million of them children -- including 1.2 million internally displaced people of Rohingya, ethnic Rakhine and other communities, were in the path of the cyclone in Rakhine State.",2023-05-17 11:01:42,https://www.thedailystar.net/environment/cyclone-mocha/news/rohingya-children-coxs-bazar-camps-faced-brunt-cyclone-mocha-unicef-3322476,2023-05-18 10:20:35,thedailystar

131,Titas wants to make domestic gas up to 47% costlier,"Titas Gas Transmission & Distribution Company has recently sent a letter to the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission proposing to hike gas prices by as much as 47 percent for domestic users.

The company said they have found that non-metered domestic gas users use more gas than assumed by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission when it fixed prices in June last year.

The company sent the letter to BERC on May 5.

According to the recent proposal of Titas, it wants domestic users to pay 1,380 per month for gas supplied to a single burner and Tk 1,592 per month for a double burner.

Currently, domestic users have to pay Tk 990 per month for a single burner and Tk 1,080 per month for a double burner.

BERC secretary Khalilur Rahman Khan told The Daily Star that it is not a formal proposal to hike the gas price. According to BERC rules, if such a proposal is sent from the distribution companies, they need to call for a public hearing before raising gas prices.

""But we will not hold a hearing on the basis of this letter. We will sit with them [to discuss] what they found and will share our findings in fixing the price,"" said the BERC secretary

""They've sent a letter saying that domestic users are using more gas than what the BERC had fixed. We will hold a views-exchange meeting with the distributor companies tomorrow.""

People in St Martin's Island are suffering from shortages of drinking water and food, two days after Cyclone Mocha hit the island.

The island is also still without power as electric cables and utility poles were damaged in the cyclone's impact.

Locals over phone informed The Daily Star that lives came to standstill as they were not being able to bring daily essentials from Teknaf due to the suspension of trawler movement.

Many claimed they are facing crisis of food and drinking water since the cyclone.

Although some relief materials have been distributed among the affected people, which are not adequate, they said.

Almost all the shops were closed in Jetighat area of the island till 9:00am today.

Kamrul Islam, a local businessman, told The Daily Star, ""Since communication between Teknaf and St Martin's has been snapped, no daily commodities can be brought from Teknaf and the essentials in local stores were almost sold out.""

Mojibur Rahman, another local resident, said, "" I am in a shortage of drinking water as the sources of fresh water have been become salty because intrusion of sea water. If fresh water is found at any place, people are running for it.""

134,"Many Myanmar Rohingyas killed by cyclone: residents, aid group","A large number of Rohingyas were killed in Myanmar when Cyclone Mocha struck at the weekend, residents, a relief group and a media outlet said yesterday.

Myanmar's strife-torn Rakhine State bore the brunt of Sunday's storm that unleashed winds of up to 210 kph (130 mph) and ripped roofs off homes, and brought a storm surge that inundated the state capital Sittwe.

The cyclone caused substantial damage in the Rakhine state, and many areas remained inaccessible.

Non-governmental relief organisation Partners said on Twitter said there were many deaths and injuries, citing its sources on the ground. It posted a video showing damage.

Reuters could not independently verify the number of casualties. Myanmar's state media on Monday reported three people were killed.

""We are scaling up our response effort to provide critical relief supplies like rice and tarps to Rohingya communities affected by Cyclone Mocha as we are able,"" Partners said in another post on Twitter.

The western Myanmar region is home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya, a persecuted minority that successive governments have refused to recognise. More than a million live in sprawling camps in neighbouring Bangladesh, having fled military crackdowns in recent years.

News portal Myanmar Now said 22 Rohingya were killed, citing residents.

Myanmar's state media on Tuesday made no mention of casualties but said junta chief Min Aung Hlaing had visited Sittwe to assess the damage, donate money and give instructions on the response.

A resident in the area, who declined to be identified over concerns for their safety, told Reuters more than 100 Rohingyas were killed, based on assessments from multiple villages he said he had visited in the aftermath.

""There are also so many missing people from the storm,"" he said. ""We didn't receive any help so far.""

Two other residents contacted by Reuters also said a large number of people had been killed, as did a diplomatic source briefed on the situation, who did not provide details.

143,BASIS calls for long-term policy support,"Suggests tax reductions in budget proposal for FY2023-24

The BASIS urged the government to allow tax-free imports of laptop and desktop computers as well as zero VAT on local software purchases. Photo: Star/file

Players in the ICT industry of Bangladesh have urged the government to adopt long-term policies, which include extending income tax exemption for the sector by six years and incentivising exports of IT-enabled services (ITES).

The Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS) recently submitted these demands to the National Board of Revenue, citing that such measures would help diversify the country's export basket and thereby combat the ongoing US dollar crisis.

In addition, BASIS urged the government for tax-free imports of laptop and desktop computers as well as zero VAT on local software purchases.

""We are in a new reality this year as the ongoing [Russia-Ukraine] war has disrupted much of the world, leading to the US dollar crunch in our country,"" said Russell T Ahmed, the president of BASIS.

""And with the government having announced its plans for Smart Bangladesh, we need these benefits and policy support to attract investment for the ICT sector,"" he added.

Ahmed went on to say that long-term policy commitments from the government are key in this regard.

""For example, the National Board of Revenue [NBR] mainly tries to meet its annual revenue target by any means, but we need sustainable policies in place of such practices,"" he said.

With income tax exemptions for 28 types of ITES companies scheduled to end by June 2024, BASIS urged the revenue authority to extend the benefit by about six years to 2030.

The government previously declared ICT as a priority sector in its policies and set the target of exporting $5 billion worth of the industry's products and services by 2025.

With the government having announced its plans for Smart Bangladesh, we need these benefits and policy support to attract investment in the ICT sector. — Russell T Ahmed President of BASIS

With this backdrop, BASIS said it is important to increase the cash incentive on exports of ITES services to 20 per cent considering how the existing 10 per cent incentive has already taken earnings from the sector to new highs.

BASIS made these demands in its budget proposals to the NBR for fiscal year 2023-24, beginning in July.

Bangladesh will lack the scope to offer cash incentives after graduating from a least developed country in 2026 and so, raising these benefits now would help explore new markets and thereby bring in more foreign currency.

Ahmed then said that as value addition in IT exports is almost 100 per cent while providers only need adequate equipment, the government should withdraw the VAT on laptops. The government imposed 15 per cent VAT on imported laptops for the current fiscal, taking the total taxation to over 30 per cent.

Coupled with other factors, such as the hike in global prices for digital devices, industry people said the government's decision has significantly impacted sales as prices have risen by 50 per cent.

""Laptop sales dropped by 40 per cent after the imposition of VAT and a grey market has boomed. So, I think revenue collection from laptop imports should be stopped,"" said Ahmed Hasan, managing director of Ryans IT.

Earlier, people could buy a laptop with Tk 30,000 but now, they need Tk 50,000.

""VAT on laptops should be withdrawn as this would ultimately bring discipline to the market,"" he added.

BASIS President Ahmed said another crucial thing for the government is to withdraw the 15 per cent VAT on local software purchases and give a certain percentage of cash incentive to the buyers.

""This would save a huge amount of foreign reserves,"" he added.

Other demands of BASIS include reducing the corporate tax for internet service providers to 10 per cent, withdrawing duty from cyber security products, and forming a Tk 300 crore fund for women entrepreneurs in the ICT sector.

Since a huge amount of foreign software is imported every year and there is an ongoing US dollar crisis, the NBR should increase the customs duty so that imports reduce, according to AKM Fahim Mashroor, chief executive officer of bdjobs.com

""This will create an opportunity for locally-made software,"" he said.

Mashroor then said the VAT on mobile handsets should also be reduced as sales have fallen drastically with prices having risen in recent months.

""If common people cannot afford smartphones, the digital or Smart Bangladesh initiative will not be successful,"" he added.

The government imposed 5 per cent VAT on handset sales this year but this means that 15 per cent VAT is ultimately paid as there are three stages of sales, said Mohammad Mesbah Uddin, chief marketing officer of Fair Electronics, Samsung's local assembly partner.

The mobile manufacturing industry is facing a grave crisis as many people are now unable to buy devices due to price hikes.

147,Why did National Tea’s share price plunge by 60%?,"It came down to Tk 251 from Tk 626

The National Tea Company came as a surprise to many stock traders today when they found that the company's share price plunged by a massive 59.89 per cent.

The stock price of the state-run listed company dropped to Tk 251 today, which was traded at Tk 626 on May 14.

Issuance of new ordinary shares and price adjustment followed by it actually caused the fall, according to the stock brokers.

The company will issue 2.34 crore ordinary shares of Tk 10 each at an issue price of Tk 119.53 each, including a premium of Tk 109.53, for which it received regulatory approval in April this year.

The adjustment was needed as the company was issuing ordinary shares to its existing 66 lakh shareholders to raise a paid-up capital of Tk 279.7 crore.

On May 15, the trading of National Tea's share remained suspended as it was the record date, which is the cut-off date established by a company in order to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive shares or a dividend.

However, National Tea's trading remained halted on May 16 also as the price adjustment was not complete.

Finally, the share price dropped after the completion of the price adjustment.

The purpose of issuance of placement share was to support the business growth (field and factory development), finance the working capital needs along with repayment of bank loan.

Of the 2.34 crore shares, 1.24 crore shares to be issued to the government, Investment Corporation of Bangladesh and Sadharan Bima Corporation.

149,Dhaka’s poverty falls by 4.3 percentage points in 2019-2022,"It declined to 22.24% from 26.54%, according to BIDS

The overall poverty headcount decreased by 4.3 percentage points in Dhaka city between 2019 and 2022, according to a survey of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS).

It came down to 22.24 per cent from 26.54 per cent, the survey data showed.

The think-tank also found that the proportion of extremely poor households declined by 3.2 percentage points from 17.01 per cent to 13.83 per cent during the period.

The BIDS disclosed the findings of the survey at the BIDS Research Almanac 2023 at the Lakeshore Hotel in Dhaka today.

""This is considerable progress in poverty reduction under the duress of Covid-19,"" BIDS Director-General Binayak Sen said while presenting a paper on ""Urban Poverty Dynamics during Covid-19 Anatomy of Resilience"".

The reduction of poverty happened due to self-employment, income transfer both from the private and public sectors, and financial dissaving, he said.

""However, the number of new poor rose, and the government should work on it.""

He said digital technology like mobile financial services played a positive role in creating self-employment.

The BIDS findings were based on panel data on 2,046 households in the urban area.

Addressing the event, Prof Shamsul Alam, state minister for planning, said some economists had a misperception that poverty doubled during the pandemic, but the BIDS's survey findings had disproved it.",2023-05-17 07:17:10,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/economy/news/dhakas-poverty-falls-43-percentage-points-2019-2022-3322366,2023-05-18 10:20:56,thedailystar

The BIDS, a policy and research-oriented think-tank, revealed the information at the BIDS Research Almanac 2023 at the Lakeshore Hotel in Dhaka today.

""Evidence shows that the importance of the new poor as a new social category is emerging as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic,"" said Binayak Sen, director-general of the BIDS.

Most of the new poor have slipped below the poverty line, so the vulnerability of people should be kept in mind in order to ensure that development is sustainable, Sen said.

He said an analysis of poverty dynamics shows that urban chronic poverty is still at a considerable level even in a growing megacity like Dhaka.

Japan's economy grew faster than expected in the first quarter, official data showed Wednesday, helped by a recovery in inbound tourism after pandemic border restrictions were lifted.

The 0.4 per cent rise in gross domestic product beat market expectations of 0.2 per cent, after hopes of a rebound fell flat in the final quarter of last year.

Spending by visitors to Japan ""rapidly recovered"" in the three months to March, Ryutaro Kono, chief economist at BNP Paribas, said ahead of the GDP data release.

152,Global debt on the rise,"Emerging markets cross $100tr mark

A measure of debt across the globe rose in the first quarter to almost $305 trillion, and the rising cost to service that debt is triggering concern about the financial system's leverage, a widely tracked study showed.

The Institute of International Finance, a financial services trade group, said on Wednesday global debt rose by $8.3 trillion in the first three months of this year compared to the end of 2022 to $304.9 trillion, the highest since the first quarter of last year and second-highest quarterly reading ever.

""Global debt is now $45 trillion higher than its pre-pandemic level and is expected to continue increasing rapidly,"" said the IIF in its quarterly Global Debt Monitor.

After peaking near 360 per cent in 2021 the debt-to-output ratio has stabilized around 335 per cent, above pre-pandemic levels.

Aging populations and rising healthcare costs continue to put spending pressure on governments, while ""heightened geopolitical tensions are also expected to drive further increases in national defense spending over the medium term,"" wrote IIF researchers.

The report partly focused on the effects of last year's rapid rise in rates in some bank balance sheets.

""Although recent bank failures appear more idiosyncratic than systemic,"" the report said, ""fear of contagion has prompted significant deposit withdrawals from US regional banks.""

The IIF voiced its concern that tighter lending practices among smaller banks would hurt some businesses and households harder.

""Given the central role of regional banks in credit intermediation in the US, worries about their liquidity positions could result in a sharp contraction in lending to some segments.""

The IIF also noted the growth of shadow banking, or credit intermediation from non-bank financials.

""Shadow banks now account for more than 14 per cent of financial markets, with the majority of growth stemming from a rapid expansion of US investment funds and private debt markets.""

Specifically, the report mentioned the ""large portion"" of corporate debt held by life insurance companies, ""raising concerns over their increased exposure to less liquid assets.""

The report showed 75 per cent of the IIF's emerging market (EM) universe saw an increase in debt levels in dollar terms in the first quarter, with the overall figure crossing over $100 trillion for the first time. China, Mexico, Brazil, India and Turkey posted the biggest increases, the data showed.

Some of the larger EMs have benefited from the relative weakness of the dollar, which has attracted investors to their local currency debt. But for others access to markets has been harder or non-existent on either tighter spreads as rates rose in developed markets or fast-rising borrowing costs.

""With the interest rate differential between EMs and mature markets diminishing, EM local currency debt is less appealing for foreign investors,"" the IIF said.",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/global-economy/news/global-debt-the-rise-3322941,2023-05-18 10:20:59,thedailystar
153,IMF official sees ‘sizeable’ upside inflation risks,"The International Monetary Fund's no. 2 official said on Wednesday she sees sizeable risks that inflation will remain high or accelerate in many emerging markets and urged central banks to keep monetary policies tight.

IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath told a conference hosted by the Central Bank of Brazil that markets were probably ""too optimistic"" about what it would take to bring down inflation in emerging markets.

""Despite encouraging signs, I am worried that price pressures seem entrenched in many economies and that upside inflation risks are sizeable,"" she said in remarks prepared for the event.

""Central banks must remain resolute in keeping policies tight and recognize that insufficient monetary tightening now may necessitate even more painful actions down the road,"" she said. That was a lesson learned from the high inflation period of the 1970s and it ""very much applies today,"" Gopinath said.

She said fiscal restraint could support the fight against inflation by central banks and financial tools could improve tradeoffs in the event of pronounced financial stress, if judiciously used.

Gopinath said emerging market economies have maintained growth in recent years, helped by strong monetary policy frameworks and reforms that had lowered credit and currency risks.

But these countries still faced ""considerable downside risks"" from monetary policy tightening in advanced economies, and conditions may get ""significantly worse,"" she said. Rate hikes in the United States, for instance, had come with still-benign conditions, but that could change in the period ahead, she said.

Gopinath said she was less optimistic than markets about lowering inflation in emerging markets, given that it had been unexpectedly high and persistent, and often rose faster than expected, she said.",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/global-economy/news/imf-official-sees-sizeable-upside-inflation-risks-3322936,2023-05-18 10:21:01,thedailystar

155,US default could trigger recession,"Treasury secretary says

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday warned that a default on government debt would likely leave millions of Americans without income payments, potentially triggering a recession that could destroy many American jobs and businesses.

Yellen told a gathering of community bankers that the unprecedented economic and financial crisis would be exacerbated by possible disruptions to the federal government's operations, including air traffic control, law enforcement, border security and national defense, and telecommunications systems.

The accompanying financial crisis could multiply the severity of the downturn, she said in remarks prepared for delivery, adding, ""It is very conceivable that we'd see a number of financial markets break - with worldwide panic triggering margin calls, runs and fire sales.""

Yellen on Monday told Congress the Treasury expects to be able to pay the US government's bills only through June 1 without a debt limit increase, heaping pressure on Republicans in Congress and the White House to reach a deal in coming days.

Failure to reach a deal would result in severe economic and financial consequences, she said.

""Our economy would suddenly find itself in an unprecedented economic and financial storm,"" she said, adding that 66 million Social Security beneficiaries and millions of veterans and military families would likely go unpaid. ""And the resulting income shock could lead to a recession that destroys many American jobs and businesses,"" she said.

Yellen said the standoff over the federal debt limit is already driving borrowing costs higher and adding to the country's debt burden, and urged Congress to avoid the ""eleventh-hour brinkmanship"" over the debt ceiling in 2011 that led to the first-ever downgrade of the US credit rating.

""Time is running out. Every single day that Congress does not act, we are experiencing increased economic costs that could slow down the US economy,"" Yellen said in remarks to the Independent Community Bankers of America.

""The US economy hangs in the balance. The livelihoods of millions of Americans do too. There is no time to waste.

Congress should address the debt limit as soon as possible.""",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/business/global-economy/news/us-default-could-trigger-recession-3322921,2023-05-18 10:21:03,thedailystar

Grameenphone Ltd's profit declined 3.8 per cent year-on-year to Tk 779.12 crore in the first quarter of 2023.

The largest mobile phone operator in Bangladesh made Tk 810.18 crore in profit in the January-March quarter of 2022.

Thus, the earnings per share were Tk 5.77 in January-March this year against Tk 6 in the same quarter last year, according to the unaudited financial statements.

The net operating cash flow per share rose to Tk 12.97 in the January-March quarter from Tk 12.52 reported in the same quarter in 2022.

The net asset value per share was Tk 40 on March 31 this year and Tk 42.94 on the same day last year. In a filing on the Dhaka Stock Exchange yesterday, GP said that the net change in cash and cash equivalent for the quarter that ended on 31 March is higher compared to a year earlier due to lower cash used in financing activities.

GP shares traded at Tk 286.60 yesterday, unchanged from a day earlier.

Meanwhile, the board of Grameenphone approved a 220 per cent cash dividend for 2022, according to a press release.

The announcement comes after the operator held its 26th annual general meeting yesterday. It was organised virtually in line with the instruction of the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission. GP announced a 125 per cent interim cash dividend pay-out earlier.

In the press release, Jorgen C Arentz Rostrup, chair of Grameenphone, said, ""2022 was a milestone year for Grameenphone, as we marked 25 years of providing mobile connectivity for millions of people and businesses across Bangladesh.""

Despite adverse regulatory and macroeconomic challenges, the company delivered top-line growth, enabled by network investments, strength in market execution, and greater efficiency from digital transformation and modernisation efforts across the organisation, he said.

In 2022, GP acquired the maximum allowable 60 MHz spectrum in the auction for the 2600 MHz band and also focused on expanding the network, said Yasir Azman, chief executive officer of Grameenphone.

175,When the municipality pollutes river,"Mymensingh city authorities yet to formulate any waste management mechanism in 22 years

Mymensingh's Akhalia river, which was once a great source of water for agriculture and local fishes in Phulbaria upazila of the district, is now in a dire state due to pollution.

Although the municipal authorities are supposed to save the river, municipal staffers dump daily garbage collected from the city into the river bank, alleged locals. The municipality, established in 2001, is yet to implement a proper waste management system.

Seeking anonymity, locals have alleged that the garbage is being dumped on the bank at different areas of the river for years and none are checking this menace. Furthermore, influential quarters are actively trying to grab the river land in many ways, they added.

Not just Akhalia, several rivers flow through this upazila, including Khiru, Banar and Bajua.

All of these rivers have been influenced by the egregious carelessness of responsible officials. In recent years, vested quarters have become increasingly organised in their attempts to seize land, said environmentalists.

The situation has become so severe that the deterioration of ecological balance, environment, and nature will surely affect the locality in the future if the river is not protected from pollution and grabbing right now, they added.

AB Siddique, a municipality commissioner, suggested the upper echelon of the local administration take the initiative to involve people belonging to all professions and political leaders to address this issue.

Md Ibrahim Khalil, conservation officer of the municipality, admitted that around 12 tonnes of garbage are produced in the municipality every day, and most are left beside the river in the absence of any permanent garbage stations.

He said they are trying to find a permanent address for the garbage soon and that the municipal authority has already selected a dumping ground at Kushmail outside the municipality.

Advocate Nazrul Islam Chunnu, convener of Jonoudhygh, a citizens' forum, said the dumping of garbage into the river by municipal authority is a gross violation of environmental laws. The public representatives are assigned to keep the environment alive but they are destroying it ignoring the possible consequences, which will lead to health hazards.

Md Nahidul Karim, upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) in Phulbaria, said the upazila administration has asked the municipal authority to stop garbage dumping into the river. They conduct regular drives to evict the grabbers but the menace is yet to be controlled fully, claimed the UNO, who is also the president of Nodi Rokhha Committee's upazila unit.",2023-04-28 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/environment/pollution/water-pollution/news/when-the-municipality-pollutes-river-3306796,2023-05-18 10:21:28,thedailystar

The United Nations yesterday called for urgent aid and support after Cyclone Mocha damaged Rohingya camps.

Cyclone Mocha wreaked havoc on over a million Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshi locals in three districts. Although the cyclone's effect might have been far worse, the refugee camps have been seriously damaged, leaving hundreds in dire need of assistance. The UN and humanitarian partners have issued an urgent plea for assistance to address the catastrophic situation, according to a press release.

Cyclone Mocha made landfall on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border on Sunday afternoon (14 May), bringing torrential rains, powerful gusts of up to 115 kilometers per hour, and severe damage to the frail infrastructure of Rohingya refugee camps and tarpaulin shelters. According to preliminary estimates, thousands of people have been impacted, and houses and critical infrastructure have been damaged, particularly in the Rohingya camps in the Teknaf region and neighboring Bangladeshi communities, it said.

The United Nations and its partners, as well as government agencies, are on the ground providing emergency support to impacted areas. Quick assessments are still being conducted. As a result of the destruction of houses and vital facilities, urgent priority include the provision of emergency shelter, clean drinking water, food supplies, and access to health and sanitation services.

In close collaboration with the UN and its partners, the government of Bangladesh developed a strong preparedness response and continues to work tirelessly to provide emergency relief to affected communities, including women, children, people with disabilities, and those more vulnerable to various risks, the release also said.

""The preparedness efforts of the humanitarian community, led by the Government of Bangladesh, have saved lives. UN agencies and humanitarian partners prepositioned core relief items in the last week, and mobile medical teams were on standby to assist Bangladeshi and refugee communities,"" said Gwyn Lewis, the UN Resident Coordinator in Bangladesh.

""The trail of destruction, with thousands of refugees seeing their shelters destroyed or damaged, requires our urgent response. The UN calls upon donors, NGOs, and individuals to rally in support of all those affected by Cyclone Mocha. Urgent financial contributions and donations of essential relief items are crucial to meet the immediate needs of those affected and to build back better,"" said the Resident Coordinator. ""We cannot stand idle in the face of this devastating humanitarian crisis.""

The humanitarian appeal for the Rohingya crisis is just 16% funded this year. Food aid has already been reduced by 17% due to funding constraints. The Rohingya refugees have faced unspeakable suffering, with hundreds losing everything in a massive fire just weeks earlier.

Cyclone Mocha has just added to their misery and made it more difficult to deliver life-saving assistance to refugees in Bangladesh, added the release.",2023-05-15 18:50:19,https://www.thedailystar.net/environment/cyclone-mocha/news/un-calls-urgent-aid-rohingya-camps-following-cyclone-mocha-3321176,2023-05-18 10:21:32,thedailystar

BTS towers are the key to staying connected for users, sending and receiving signals to and from our phones whenever our phones are within range of the area covered by a tower.

The 243 towers not working in Cox's Bazar district as of today are shared fairly equally between the four operators in the industry.

Market leader Grameenphone has 60 out of its 219 towers out of order; Robi Axiata Limited, which owns 461 towers in the district since its merger with Airtel in Bangladesh, has 87 not working as of this afternoon.

Banglalink, with 185 towers under ownership in Cox's Bazar, is working without 51 of them.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, state-owned TeleTalk Bangladesh sees the highest proportion of its towers out of service - 45 out of 109, nearly half.

The authorities are trying their best to make these operational again, said a BTRC press release issued today.

It also said most of the mobile internet system in Cox's Bazar district is ""active now"", while the mobile operators are trying their best to make their sites operational.

Yet their hands may be tied in this regard, as most of the sites remain inactive due to disrupted power supply where they are located. BTRC said the sites will resume normal functions soon after the resumption of power connection.

Initially over 500 of the towers were knocked out of service on Sunday, soon after Mocha hit. Some 271 towers have since had power restored, allowing them to be operational again.",2023-05-15 16:44:16,https://www.thedailystar.net/environment/cyclone-mocha/news/cyclone-mocha-25-telco-towers-coxs-bazar-still-not-working-3320991,2023-05-18 10:21:35,thedailystar

However, no casualties had been reported as the authorities concerned managed to move vulnerable people from cyclone-prone areas to shelters, he said while talking to reporters at the Secretariat.

When the very severe cyclonic storm Mocha crossed Bangladesh's coast, the wind speed was 148 km per hour in Saint Martin's island and 80 km in Cox's Bazar and Teknaf, said the state minister.

Mentioning the damages caused by Mocha, Enamur said many trees were uprooted while a number of people were injured. They are undergoing treatment in local hospitals, he said.

Besides, the local administration is taking care of those who returned to their respective homes, he said.

""We have asked to provide corrugated iron sheets and cash money for the rehabilitation of the people in vulnerable areas and a list will be made and necessary assistance will be provided as per the list,' he said.

Replying to a question, the state minister said the respective ministries will ascertain the damage caused by Mocha in crop, fisheries, power and road sectors.

183,Dhaka city alone experiencing over 600 MW of load shedding during daytime,"Dhaka has alone been experiencing more than 600 MW of load shedding during daytime when demand for electricity remains relatively low than nighttime.

According to official sources, like the previous few days, the country has been seeing over 2000 MW of power shortage.

As a result, consumers across the country are facing power outages for 6 to 7 hours in different spells during the day.

""After the evening, the situation will be deteriorating with the increase in demand,"" said a top official of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) preferring anonymity.

He attributed the gas shortage for the severe situation in power supply.

""Actually, we have been getting lower supply of gas that forced us to keep at least 25 generation units across the country shut,"" he said.

He, however, said that if the BPDB receives normal supply of gas, it can produce 6,500 MW of electricity from its gas-fired plants.

""But now we're producing 4667 MW and about 1,833 MW of electricity is not available for gas shortage,"" he noted.

Meanwhile, managing director Dhaka Electric Supply Company (Desco) Md. Kausar Ameer Ali said that the area under it was experiencing a load shedding of 308 MW in the daytime.

""The Desco is receiving about 800 MW against a demand of 1111 MW,"" he told UNB.

Desco is entrusted with the responsibility to distribute electricity in Dhaka city's north, north-west and eastern parts while Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC) is responsible for power supply in the south, southeast and central part of Dhaka city.

DPDC Managing director Bikash Dewan said that areas under DPDC has been experiencing a shortage of about 340 MW which might be up after the evening.

He said DPDC has a demand of more than 1600 MW and receiving 1250 MW.

However, consumers are complaining that they have to experience a huge load shedding.

In some areas, people are allegedly experiencing power outages just in every alternative hour.

""Power cuts are frequent and we have been experiencing load shedding in every alternative hour,"" said Abdus Selim, a resident in the city's Niketan area.

Tens of thousands of people in a major Myanmar port city were cut off from contact on Monday after a deadly cyclone tore through the west of the country and neighbouring Bangladesh.

Cyclone Mocha made landfall between Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh and Myanmar's Sittwe packing winds of up to 195 kilometres (120 miles) per hour, the biggest storm to hit the Bay of Bengal in over a decade.

By late Sunday, the storm had largely passed, sparing the refugee camps housing almost a million Rohingya in Bangladesh, where officials said there had been no deaths.

Three people were killed in Myanmar, the junta said on Monday, two in Rakhine state and one in southern Ayeyarwady region.

""Some residents were injured"" in the storm, the statement said, without giving details, adding that 864 houses and 14 hospitals or clinics had been damaged across the country.

Communications were still down on Monday with Rakhine's capital Sittwe, home to around 150,000 people and which bore the brunt of the storm according to cyclone trackers.

The road to Sittwe was littered with trees, pylons and power cables, AFP correspondents said, with vehicles full of rescuers and locals trying to reach the city and their relatives forming queues.

""We drove all the way through the cyclone yesterday and cut trees and pushed away pylons... but then the big trees blocked the road,"" an ambulance driver trying to reach Sittwe told AFP.

He and others were using a chainsaw to cut through branches of trees blocking the road.

""I want to go home as fast as I can because we don't know the situation in Sittwe,"" a man from the town told AFP, requesting anonymity.

""There is no phone line, there is no internet... I'm worried for my home and belongings.""

Mocha made landfall on Sunday, bringing a storm surge and high winds that toppled a communications tower in Sittwe, according to images published on social media.

""Everything has been damaged in Sittwe,"" one resident who was in the city told AFP.

""I was in a Buddhist monastery when the storm came. The prayer hall and monk dining hall have collapsed. We had to move from this building and that building. Now roads are blocked as trees and pylons are fallen.""

Junta-affiliated media reported that the storm had put hundreds of base stations, which connect mobile phones to networks, out of action in Rakhine state.

Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing had ""instructed officials to make preparations for Sittwe Airport transport relief,"" state media reported, without giving details on when relief was expected to arrive.

- 'Extensive damage' -

The United Nations said communications problems meant it had not yet been able to assess the damage in Rakhine state, which has been ravaged by ethnic conflict for years.

""Early reports suggest the damage is extensive,"" the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late on Sunday.

On Bangladesh's Shah Porir Dwip island, residents began repairing damaged homes, searching through debris and retrieving scattered possessions.

Bangladesh officials said they had evacuated 750,000 people.

Secretary of the disaster management ministry, Kamrul Hasan, told AFP on Monday that no one had died in the cyclone.

In the Rohingya camps, where about a million people live in 190,000 bamboo and tarpaulin shelters, the damage was also minimal, officials said.

""About 300 shelters were destroyed by the cyclone,"" deputy refugee commissioner Shamsud Douza told AFP.

The chances of landslides in the camps were also low ""due to lack of rain"".

""The sky has become clear.""

In recent years, better forecasting and more effective evacuation planning have dramatically reduced the death toll from such storms.

Scientists have warned that storms are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of climate change.

Cyclones -- the equivalent of hurricanes in the North Atlantic or typhoons in the Northwest Pacific -- are a regular and deadly menace on the coast of the northern Indian Ocean where tens of millions of people live.

Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar's Irrawaddy Delta in 2008, killing at least 138,000 people.

The then-junta faced international criticism for its response to the disaster. It was accused of blocking emergency aid and initially refusing to grant access to humanitarian workers and supplies.",2023-05-15 07:15:52,https://www.thedailystar.net/environment/cyclone-mocha/news/myanmar-port-city-cut-mocha-aftermath-3320591,2023-05-18 10:21:39,thedailystar

Director of the airport, Group Captain Taslim Ahmed, said regular flights will depart from Shah Amanat International Airport from today.

Earlier, due to inclement weather caused by Cyclone Mocha, the authority suspended flights at Shah Amanat International Airport from 6:00am on May 13 after Bangladesh Meteorological Department issued the No 8 disaster signal in Chattogram.

Meanwhile, all activities of Chattogram port were suspended since May 12 night due to fear of damage from Cyclone Mocha. Ships were being brought back to the jetty and outer anchor early today.

The Meteorological Department has asked Chattogram port to hoist local cautionary signal number 3 after the impact of Cyclone Mocha has passed. After the situation became normal, the Chittagong Port Authority decided to withdraw its alert-4 and normalise the port operations.

The port will be fully operational from this morning, said Chattogram Port Authority Secretary Md Omar Farouk.",2023-05-15 04:36:22,https://www.thedailystar.net/environment/cyclone-mocha/news/ctg-airport-port-fully-operate-today-3320501,2023-05-18 10:21:40,thedailystar

It's a sigh of relief for Bangladesh.

Cyclone Mocha veered towards Myanmar and eventually made landfall there a few hours earlier than forecast and it did not cause massive damage that many in Bangladesh feared.

Around 13,500 houses were affected by the cyclone in Cox's Bazar, including St Martin's Island, and the Rohingya refugee camps. And some 15 to 20 people had minor injuries, said officials concerned.

Mocha hit Myanmar with windspeeds of around 209kmph.

Around 1:00pm, St Martin's Island in Bangladesh saw windspeeds of around 100kmph, Nazmul Haque, a meteorologist at Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), told The Daily Star.

The storm crossed the Myanmar coastline by evening and weakened into a deep depression over Sittwe, Myanmar, a BMD bulletin said.

The Met office advised ""cautionary signal number-3"", which means ships at ports could be in harm's way and the windspeeds will be between 40kmph and 50kmph, for port authorities of Cox's Bazar.

THE DAMAGES

Around 1,000 houses and 100 cottages for tourists were damaged on St Martin's Island, said Mujibur Rahman, chairman of St Martin's union parishad.

The cyclone unleashed havoc on the island, he said. There is a severe crisis of drinking water.

A woman was injured after a tree fell on her, he said.

People started returning home in the evening. But the children and the elderly people were still at the cyclone shelters, he said.

However, Cox's Bazar's Additional District Magistrate Abu Sufian said some 700 houses were damaged on the island.

In the Rohingya refugee camps of Cox's Bazar, a total of 2,826 shanties were affected by Mocha, said Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC) Mizanur Rahman.

Among those, 278 shanties were destroyed while 2,548 were damaged, according to a report from the office of RRRC around 11:00pm.

Seven Rohingyas were injured, the report said.

Besides, 32 learning centres, one healthcare centre and 29 mosques were also affected, the report said.

There were landslides in 120 places inside the camps, the report said, adding that 5,386 Rohingyas had been relocated to safety.

According to the preliminary data of the district administration, at least 2,522 huts were destroyed and 10,469 houses were damaged in the eight upazilas of Cox's Bazar.

Over 3.34 lakh people in the upazilas were affected by Mocha and over 2.37 lakh took cover in cyclone shelters.

People started returning home from the cyclone shelters yesterday afternoon, said Bibhishan Kanti Das, additional deputy commissioner (ADC) of Cox's Bazar.

Some 15 to 20 people were injured in Cox's Bazar. They took first aid and went home, claimed Md Abu Sufian, additional district magistrate (ADM) of Cox's Bazar.

The people of Hatiya and Nijhum Dwip in Noakhali were fearing tidal surges last night.

""We have warned people about tidal surges and directed them to rush to the cyclone shelters if there were tidal surges,"" said Hatiya Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Kaisar Khasru.

There was no significant damage caused in Noakhali by the storm.

187,3 killed as Mocha lashes Myanmar,"Floods, destruction reported

Thousands of people hunkered down yesterday in monasteries, pagodas and schools, seeking shelter from a powerful storm that slammed into the coast of Myanmar, tearing the roofs off buildings and killing at least three people.

Myanmar appears to have borne the direct impact of Cyclone Mocha, as winds of up to 210 kph (130 mph) ripped through settlements and brought down a communications tower.

The center of the cyclone made landfall in the afternoon in Rakhine state near Sittwe township, Myanmar's Meteorological Department said.

Parts of Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine state, were flooded and the ground floors of several buildings were underwater, a video posted on social media by a witness in the city showed.

Myanmar's military information office said the storm had damaged houses, electrical transformers, cell phone towers, boats and lampposts in Sittwe, Kyaukpyu, and Gwa townships. It said the storm also tore roofs off of buildings on the Coco Islands, about 425 kilometers southwest of the country's largest city, Yangon.

More than 4,000 of Sittwe's 300,000 residents were evacuated to other cities and more than 20,000 people are sheltering in sturdy buildings such as monasteries, pagodas and schools located on the city's highlands, said Tin Nyein Oo, who is volunteering in shelters in Sittwe.

Yesterday morning, at least 3 deaths caused by wind and rain were reported in Myanmar.

A rescue team from the country's eastern Shan state announced on its Facebook social media page that they had recovered the bodies of a couple who were buried when a landslide caused by heavy rain hit their house in Tachileik township. Local media reported that a man was crushed to death when a banyan tree fell on him in Pyin Oo Lwin township in the central Mandalay Region.

In Sittwe, a cell phone tower collapsed under high wind and other buildings were damaged, local media reported.

Across Rakhine state and the northwest of the country, about 6 million people were already in need of humanitarian assistance, while 1.2 million have been displaced, according to the UN humanitarian office (OCHA).

Hundreds of thousands of the Muslim Rohingya minority remain in Myanmar's Rakhine state, where many are confined to camps separated from the rest of the population.

""The state government has moved many Rohingya from Sittwe camps to higher grounds area,"" Zaw Min Tun, a Rohingya resident in Sittwe said, adding that the evacuation took place without any warning.

""They also didn't provide any food to them, so people are starving.""

PEEK-A-BIRD… A lineated barbet peeks out of its home in a tree hollow at the Botanical Garden in the capital. This species of Asian barbets is non-migratory and found mostly across Southeast Asia, India, Bhutan and Bangladesh. They prefer sheltering in deciduous forests, or parks and gardens where they can not only camouflage themselves in the canopies of trees and nest in the cavities but can find plenty of food – fruits and small insects. Highly aggressive and territorial, lineated barbets stay only in pairs and are very protective of their homes. This is why you will hardly ever see them in groups. Although they are in the “Least Concern” category of the IUCN Red List, pet trading does pose a threat to this species.

She could be a ringleader, my mother.

She could lead an armada into barbaric waves

With her cigarette gently glowing

Nestled in the peace sign that forms between her fingers.

She's a contradiction, my mother.

She holds sharp blades to the soft skin of fruits,

Watches, expressionless,

As she skins them between her gentle hands, soaked through

With trickles that oozed off their flesh.

She impales the bodies of chickens she prepares for a feast—

My mother holds taut the fat clinging to the meat,

By the sleight of her hand, separates it,

And hurls it into the bin by the kitchen sink.

It hits polythene with a slap.

My mother, she tends to flames with one scarred hand—

Plays corrida de toros with the steak flanks she sears on the pan,

Showers the red hot flesh lying on the grills with boiling hot oil.

Stray droplets singe her skin,

But she goes around the kitchen,

Spinning wild and elegant, in her Paso Doble dance.

194,What to make of the diversity in the International Booker shortlist,"Several threads of commonality tie the books together just as their origins showcase their differences

With only a couple of weeks left until the International Booker Prize 2023 is awarded, this year's shortlist, described by judges as ""bold, subversive, nicely perverse"", is worth a review.

The International Booker Prize is an annual award presented for the ""finest single work of fiction"" in English translation, published in the UK and Ireland, as the official website states. The prize aims to not only highlight the works of both renowned and lesser known authors from around the globe, but also celebrate the vital contributions made by translators and translated fiction to the literary world. The winning author and translator will split GBP 50,000, with shortlisted authors and translators each receiving GBP 2,500.

The shortlist for 2023, announced on April 18, 2023, comprised the following books: Boulder by Eva Baltasar, translated from the Catalan by Julia Sanches; Whale by Cheon Myeong-kwan, translated from the Korean by Chi-Young Kim; The Gospel According to the New World by Maryse Condé, translated from the French by Richard Philcox; Standing Heavy by GauZ', translated from the Ivorian by Frank Wynne; Time Shelter by Georgi Gospodinov, translated from the Bulgarian by Angela Rodel; and Still Born by Guadalupe Nettel, translated from the Spanish by Rosalind Harvey.

The shortlist for 2023 features works from Bulgaria, Côte d'Ivoire, France, Mexico, South Korea and Spain, altogether covering books across four continents. Their translators, too, hail from a similarly diverse range of nationalities, including Brazilian, Irish, South Korean, British, and American. As such, the list reflects what one of its judges believes the International Booker Prize sets out to demonstrate, that ""what unites us can be stronger than what divides us"". In a world increasingly mired in strife and hostility over our differences, such an ideal guiding the curation of groundbreaking world literature speaks volumes.

Unsurprisingly, books belonging to such distinctly different parts of the world will bring different perspectives to the table. An interesting observation on this year's shortlist, however, is that several threads of commonality—be it in theme, form, or subject—tie the books together just as their origins showcase their differences. Colonial legacies are explored in both Standing Heavy and The Gospel According to the New World, with the former critiquing French colonialism and the latter commenting on how colonial consequences have persevered in the Caribbean. Other nominated books, such as Whale, Boulder, and Still Born look at the lives of women in their respective contexts, consequently tackling issues of love, desire, agency, motherhood, history, and more.

The chair of judges, author Leïla Slimani, has stated how the books featured in this year's list are ""not abstract or theoretical books, but very grounded books, about people, places and moments"", and thus books arising in many ways from the realities we find ourselves in 2023—not sealed away in decontextualized pockets and vacuums but, instead, rooted in explorations of our histories and futures in light of the present. And so, the International Booker Prize 2023, set to be announced on May 23, 2023, leaves an incredible selection for its followers and avid readers to look forward to.

Last year's International Booker Prize was awarded to author Geetanjali Shree and translator Daisy Rockwell for Tomb of Sand, the first Hindi language novel to win the prize.

196,Panihar Public Library: A heritage in ruins,"A library containing more than 7702 periodicals, encyclopedias and books on literature, religion, poetry, science and economics—all wasting away from neglect.

The 72-year-old Panihar Public Library was established in the mid-1940s, arriving as a beacon for the people of Panihar, a remote village of Rajshahi's Godagari upazila, which had been formerly immersed in the darkness of illiteracy. It served the community for seven decades.

Disregard and neglect has now dimmed its light. The library, which was run under the Ministry of Education and Culture during the Pakistan period, has stopped receiving endowment. More than 7,500 books have been destroyed due to lack of renovation and preservation.

Apart from this, not many readers are seen in these libraries due to the lack of a proper reading environment; instead, one can easily spot termites moving across the space. Valuable books which are more than 100 years old are turning into ruins.

According to library sources, a philanthropist named Enayetullah Master built the library in a tin shed house on two acres of land next to his house. Today it stands without any touch of modernity. However, many poets, writers and researchers rush to access a lot of its rare books.

Daingpara intersection is situated in the Godagari upazila headquarter, which is about 35 kilometers away from Rajshahi city. Aihai village is 12 km away from here. Back in the days, this area, which lies within the arid Barendra region, was inhabited by indigenous groups. The road used to access the area was a long and wide one. One could access Panihar village after crossing the winding narrow road through Aihai village. This region is still known as a remote area within Rajshahi city dwellers. But Panihar is known not only in the country but is also recognized internationally due to its library.

Going there and seeing the library in front of my very own eyes made me tear up. An old newspaper file on the table was being consumed by termites; the wooden cupboards were falling apart; valuable books inside were in an unprotected state. Librarian Moazzem Hossain said that they are struggling to protect the priceless books. The walls of the library are hung with portraits of famous events and sages.

How was this library established in such a remote area? Veteran reader Rafiqul Alam said that the founder Enayetullah's father was a farmer but had a thirst for learning. As a result, he sent his son to Nawab Bahadur High School in Murshidabad, where he passed the entrance exam in the Bangla year of 1318. It was during this time that he became a member of the Nawab Bahadur High School library, which he used to visit frequently. When he returned to the village, he dreamed of establishing his own library.

Building on this aspiration, he first established a school in the Aihai village. The school started in 1938 with a monthly salary of 15 taka for teachers. He went from house to house to convince parents to let their children attend his school. Textbooks were brought from Calcutta—but the library did not exist as of yet. As the number of books increased, the Panihar Library was established in 1945.

Enayetullah reached out to the villagers to contribute to the library. He constructed the building in front of his house, using mud. At the same time, Sagaram Majhi—a classmate of Enayetullah—was elected as the MLA from this area in the United Front elections. Majhi came forward to support Enayetullah's initiative. Soon, the library was bustling with readers.

Librarian Moazzem Hossain tells me that this library has more than 7,702 periodicals, encyclopedias and books on a plethora of topics, such as: literature, religions, poetry, science and economics. There are about 30 cupboards, 4 tables, and 30 chairs. Moazzem could not keep any daily newspapers due to lack of funding. Before the pandemic, 20 to 25 readers used to come regularly. The number has come down to around 10 or 12 people since the pandemic. Mobile phones have become popular during the pandemic, Moazzem observes, and therefore it has become difficult for readers to adopt the habit of reading books.

Panihar Library has books from a multitude of authors, from Bankim, Sarat, Rabindranath, Nazrul, and Abul Mansur Ahmad to the popular Humayun Ahmed. There are many periodicals from both sides of the border, such as Shonibarer Chithi, which was edited by Rajinikanth Das of Kolkata, Mashik Mohammadi, Mahe Nao, Jayati, Notun Din, Joy Bangla and Dainik Bangla. These books are arranged in the cupboards of the three rooms of the new building. Former Minister Prabhas Chandra Lahiri, Shaheed Dhirendranath Dutta, Pallikabi Jasimuddin, Kavi Bande Ali Mia, Charankabi Abdul Mannan of North Bengal and many other eminent persons have visited the Panihar Library, Moazzem tells me.

Panihar Public Library President Abdul Matin shares that the library was first approved in 1958. The name was changed to 'Panihar Public Library'. During that period, it was administered under the Ministry of Education and Culture and the annual grant received was 500 rupees. In 1980, the Ministry handed it over to the Deputy Commissioner, who in turn handed it over to the Upazila Nirbahi Officer in 2000. No more donations came to the library since then, barring irregularly received sums from the Ministry of Culture. No grants have come to the library since 2017 despite several applications.

Some politicians occasionally visit the library, but their promises of improvement, too, remain unimplemented, according to library officials.

However, Godagari Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Jane Alam tells The Daily Star, ""I have visited the library twice. It seemed very important to me. I asked them to contact me regarding the library and that I would fully cooperate once they make a request detailing what it will require. But they did not communicate. I would request them to communicate officially.""

""Old libraries often do not formally apply, and so they do not receive grants"", explains Minar Mansoor, Director of the National Library Center, ""But such libraries should get grants. I will look into it through the divisional librarian.""

It is worth noting the absence of a computer, internet connection or any IT equipment in Panihar library. Modernity hasn't even touched the place. A two-room structure was built next to the mud house with the help of the upazila council in the '90s. The abandoned mud house next to this two-room library, with some children reading in the afternoon on its balcony, is now used as a school and reading room for public education programs. This is where the work of Panihar Library initially began.

Gholam Mostafa, a student of Rajshahi University who has visited the library, told The Daily Star, ""There is a rare collection of books and periodicals of Bengali literature. Administrators should come forward to preserve them so that the library survives by capturing the history of the country.""

Writer and researcher Khan Md. Rabiul Alam echoes, ""I went to Panihar Library for a while and was surprised. They have a wonderful collection of books and magazines. 72 years ago, such a library was unthinkable in a remote village. It is very important to sustain it. I think that this library is an important monument of Bangladesh. These initiatives often do not come to our attention and, therefore, they should be kept alive collectively.""

197,Experiencing architecture around us,"A space is more than a vicinity that shelters us. It morphs our emotions, helps our thoughts take shape, carves out a pathway to meet like-minded people, and creates communities. We spend a large fraction of our lives indoors, which impacts us in ways we don't even realise. Such is the pedigree of a discipline that is forged by culture and society. The application of architecture isn't merely to keep track of our physical footprints, it is a practice that is also meant to address our needs. By building on existing values and having them interweave with the contemporary, architecture, in turn, also shapes culture and society.

Whether to represent royalty, protect from harsh climates, or spark awe, architecture has always been emblematic of its time, location, and climate. Igloos are built with ice due to their low thermal conductivity and accessibility in the region. Japanese and Chinese architectural identities overlap due to their connection to Buddhism. The Taj Mahal utilises concepts of symmetry as well as rational and strict geometry to perpetuate the notion that Mughal leadership is flawless. A closer look at Dhaka and the parallels between the city and the livelihood of its people float to the surface. An urban jungle, lined with grey cement blocks as far as the eye can see. No corner is spared. Does it all stand to represent that people are trying to just get by? As morbid as this outlook might be, I am certain I am not the only one who bears it.

Nuren Iftekhar, a Dhaka University graduate currently working as a teacher abroad, shares his views. ""Dhaka often feels like a canvas that different artists tried to paint on at the same time. A canvas that then got painted over by an amateur mason,"" he says. ""Functionality has far outpaced the sense of beauty or cohesion. A walk through my area only shows apartments whose sole purpose is to hold as many people as the zoning board approves. Wide stretched balconies have been replaced by tiny alcoves with the sole purpose of drying clothes.""

Rashed H. Chowdhury, the principal architect at Dehsarworks, highlights the significance of architecture on the zeitgeist. ""A built environment is the result of all our collective effort and thoughts. While architects are the ones designing the spaces, they are responding to the needs of society. The projects also affect our conscious minds. The cause and effect go hand-in-hand.""

""The primary identifier of any nation is its architectural landmarks, and I believe it is a visible envelope of our society,"" he said.

A building, even with its ornamental exterior and grand scale, is only as good as the amenities of the interior. If the space inside fails to fulfil its function, then by no means does it qualify as good design. By carefully curating the right forms, colours, shapes, light, and proportions, designers can influence how an occupant might feel.

""If anyone is stuck in a room that isn't exposed to natural light, has the same temperature throughout the day, and boasts no tangible change in the interior, it creates fatigue amongst its occupants,"" asserts Rashed.

Iftekhar recalls what stood out to him about the design of Curzon Hall, where he attended classes in university. ""Perhaps the most noticeable aspect of Curzon hall was the uniformity. From the old halls to the newly established buildings, it is present everywhere. Even the Zoology building, with its separate colour scheme, felt like an extension of the original architectural vision. Any deviation from it feels jarring which is evident in the newer buildings. Despite having better accommodation, they never evoked the same feeling that Curzon hall did,"" he said.

Subah Shaheen, Manager at Robi Axiata Limited, discusses the use of symbolism in her workplace, ""Our workplace has a great interior. There are words and icons dispersed throughout the walls on each floor, representing the core values, visions and objectives of the company. This not only reinforces what we hear in meetings and townhalls but is a constant reminder throughout the day about what we are trying to achieve and why.""

There is evidence that using certain elements in the interior will evoke a specific kind of ambience and mood. Furthermore, a building serves a wide variety of needs of many different people. Even then, the space must serve more than one purpose for each individual Therefore, it really isn't feasible to predict how one might respond to their environment.

Iftekhar comments on how the architecture of Dhaka University and Curzon Hall makes him feel. ""The first thing that Curzon hall evoked in my mind as I first stepped foot there as a freshman was grandeur. As cliched as it sounds, the wide hallway, the old arches and the red bricks gave it a sense of timelessness.""

""Having a common space in every floor creates an opportunity for social interaction within the office. The space enables employees to have important discussions, enjoy a game of foosball, and does wonders to help relax during the day. It also helps us save time as you don't have to get out of the office to unwind,"" said Subah about her workplace.

New spaces must be designed to meet various needs. However, what appears to have taken precedence are economic benefits. Allowing capitalistic interests to dictate urban planning causes efficiency to trump empathy for the people. In the process, citizens are left stuck with a lack of open spaces, poorly designed footpaths, and a monotonous cityscape. Urban planners and policymakers must instil changes that account for the welfare of the people.

In a write-up for The Grudging Urbanist titled ""There is just one way to save Dhaka"", Adnan Zillur Morshed, renowned architect, architectural historian, and urbanist, attributed the capital's rampant traffic crisis to a lack of land-use planning. ""We allowed the city to become an untenable urban juggernaut, an infernal urban agglomeration, paying little attention to how the city's land could be developed with a logical sequence of use and zoning,"" he says.

He urges that Dhaka undertake land-use planning – a system that opts for areas to facilitate schools, grocery shops, malls and other venues for recreation within walking distance of the residents. As a result, it will eliminate the need to travel long distances and reduce congestion within the city.

""I think what can really help the capital embrace openness is to first improve public transport. Discouraging the use of personal vehicles and harbouring collective commute is vital. It bunches people up and frees up space. The prospect of being a part of a community should be cherished and design should enable that. The fabric of the city should be people-centric,"" remarked Rashed.

Design: Aaqib Hasib

Nonetheless, what plagues much of Dhaka is the invasion of open spaces. Footpaths are occupied, fields are a parading ground for local politicians, seasonal melas, or construction sites, and due to the steep climb in the rate of urbanisation, water bodies are at risk because of housing accommodations.

While it will generate employment in the tertiary sector, create new forms of income, and help the economy, this approach is myopic. Natural resources are compromised and historical landmarks are destroyed all for the sake of ""development"". What gets overlooked, as a result, are other problems that will have to be tackled in the future. If the correct measures are not taken now, the benefits of the present will merely be consolation.

An architect can let all the principles of design guide them but a design that is not centred around people is a design that will inevitably fail. Spaces are social spheres, grounds for igniting important conversations and inspiring change. A city that breeds unhappiness is a place that is waiting to fall apart. To nourish it is to let its inhabitants thrive. It is time we let consciousness spearhead architecture and design.

Rashed Chowdhury is hopeful about the future of architecture. He believes what allows it to thrive and makes it a promising field is the vastness, scope of innovation, geopolitical nature of Bangladesh and the spirit of youth.

""Unlike anywhere else in the world, Bangladeshi architecture incorporates a lot of diversity. Due to the reform having grey area, we are allowed to venture out and explore,"" he concludes.

198,What students can expect from a major in Architecture,"""Drawing, colours, paint, and art fascinated me from a young age. I studied science during my O and A-levels hoping to pursue a medical degree. However, I have been intrigued by architecture since the sixth grade. Being the perfect amalgamation of art and science, this choice came very naturally to me,"" says Nuzhat Shama, a Research Assistant at the Center for Inclusive Architecture and Urbanism, BRAC University, and an Executive Architect at Interform Studio RANCON.

Like Nuzhat, many out there are captivated by the field of architecture and all that it has to offer in terms of academics and as a career. What most of these aspirants do not know, however, is that architecture is a lot more than just drawing buildings and designing interiors. Thus, it is a major that many want to enrol in, but only few are aware of what to truly expect from it.

One of the first things you will notice when enrolling in a Bachelor of Architecture program is that the number of credit hours needed for this degree is significantly higher than most other undergraduate programs. Where most undergrad degrees require somewhere between 130 to 160 credits, you have to complete around 200 credits for a B.Arch. degree, but there is good reason for that.

""Building and structure design is the art and science of architecture. The understanding of physics, engineering, and mathematics is needed to produce designs that are both aesthetically beautiful and structurally sound. For developing comprehensive plans for entire cities and regions, many architects also collaborate with landscape architects, interior designers, and urban planners. So, we also need to learn the basics of landscaping, interior designing and urban planning. Thus comes the need for so many courses and therefore, so many credit hours,"" says Pantha Shahriar, an Associate Architect at Triangle Consultants.

""Project management is also something we must learn about,"" adds Pantha. ""Architects are the ones overseeing entire projects these days including costs and materials. We also have to learn the basics of electrical connections and plumbing that run inside the structures we design, making the curriculum more extensive.""

The architecture curriculum often consists of courses covering topics like history, art, music, environment and ecosystem, etc. For someone with little to no idea about the curriculum, this may come as a surprise. They might even think that these courses are unnecessary and are only adding to the burden of completing the already huge curriculum. Of course, that's not the case. These courses are vital for anyone studying architecture as Nuzhat explains.

""When you are an architect, you are responsible for creating the environment which shapes human beings including their habits, mindsets, cultures, lives, leisure, memories, and so on,"" says Nuzhat.

""You are essentially directing their destinies. Architecture continues to contribute to city skylines and entire urban landscapes. Tunnel vision leads to projects which are bound to fail eventually. Objectivity and critical thinking are of utmost importance. An architect needs to be a well-rounded professional, which is why such courses are so important and contribute so much to the making of an architect.""

Then there are the classes themselves. Apart from the typical theory and lab courses, architecture students also have to attend studio courses.

""Studio courses are extremely unconventional by nature,"" Nuzhat explains. ""You apply learned-knowledge in the studio during the course of five years. You are encouraged to treat the studio as your own home. You can picture it as a workshop with flickering lights from desktop PCs, cutting mats, NT cutters, papers, and countless other materials strewn everywhere.""

Lectures and lessons aren't confined to just classrooms and studios. Architecture students often have to go on site-visits to explore various types of architecture. From historical monuments to modern residential buildings, these students take these trips to get a better understanding of how practicality comes into play when bringing an architectural design to life.

On top of that, architecture students these days also have to focus on sustainability and how to ensure it in their work, which they also get to understand through taking field trips and more importantly, through completing an abundance of projects during their undergrad life. Perhaps the biggest project and challenge they take on is their undergrad thesis.

Working on your undergrad thesis is a daunting experience irrespective of your field of study. In the case of architecture students, however, the experience is a lot more unpleasant.

""What makes our thesis defence so nerve wracking is definitely the sheer volume of work,"" says Nuzhat.

""Every single line you draw has to be done deliberately. Every millimetre of material has to be taken into consideration. It is normalised to create and lead teams of juniors and/or seniors to help you out with the workload. From my experience, I had my team working on the project over the course of three months at my place.""

""During the last month, we were pulling in 12-16 hours of work,"" adds Nuzhat. ""We had to finish drawing the building blueprints, buying materials, distributing workloads, post processing imagery, creating videos, composing sheets, and building the physical models during this time.""

The thesis project runs alongside multiple other projects and models that these students have to work on. What this does is increase the pressure on architecture students as well as drive up the costs they need to bear.

""Besides the tuition fees, there are some hidden costs in studying architecture that many are unaware of,"" says Pantha.

""Majority of the cost is generated from the materials for the models, but there are other significant investments an architecture student may need to make, like buying a high-end PC for visualisation, 3D modelling, rendering, and animation. Expensive and rare stationery items for hand drawing, drafting, and graphical rendering are also necessary. Moreover, there is a significant amount of cost generated from sheet printing for architectural jury and presentations.""

The difficulties don't end there. There is nothing conventional about the way Architecture is taught. Normally, for most undergrad courses, you study for a course, attend a few lab classes, and give exams – that's not the case here. Architecture is somewhat of a lifestyle. The abnormal workload is also something you have to deal with and eventually normalise if you want to continue studying in this field. Nuzhat's advice for those looking to study architecture sums up the whole experience perfectly.

""If you love yourself, don't study architecture,"" she says. ""Jokes apart, the only way to survive this subject is through sheer grit.""

A previously unknown self-portrait of Vincent Van Gogh has been discovered behind another of the artist's paintings, the National Galleries of Scotland said Thursday.

The self-portrait was found on the back of Van Gogh's ""Head of a Peasant Woman"" when experts at the Edinburgh gallery took an X-ray of the canvas ahead of an upcoming exhibition. The work is believed to have been hidden for over a century, covered by layers of glue and cardboard when it was framed in the early 20th century.

Van Gogh was known for turning canvases around and painting on the other side to save money.

The portrait shows a bearded sitter in a brimmed hat. Experts said the subject was instantly recognizable as the artist himself, and is thought to be from his early work. The left ear is clearly visible and Van Gogh famously cut his off in 1888.

Frances Fowle, a senior curator at the National Galleries of Scotland, said the discovery was ""thrilling.""

""Moments like this are incredibly rare,"" she said. ""We have discovered an unknown work by Vincent Van Gogh, one of the most important and popular artists in the world.""

The gallery said experts are evaluating how to remove the glue and cardboard without harming ""Head of a Peasant Woman.""

Visitors to an upcoming Impressionist exhibit at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh can see an X-ray image of the self-portrait through a lightbox.

201,15 years of iPhone: Evolution in photography,"This week marks 15 years since the iPhone first went on sale and ushered in a new era: the age of the smartphone.

It's hard to imagine today how different mobile access was before that evening of June 29, 2007. The internet in your pocket didn't look like, well, the internet. Social media — and the ability for everyone to respond globally to everything — was in its infancy. And while older phones certainly had cameras, the quality – and the potential for instant editing and filtering and sharing that exists today — wasn't there yet.

The modern smartphone has changed photography. To capture a snapshot of that change, we asked more than a dozen Associated Press photographers across the world who use iPhones — some of the most talented journalists in the business — to capture an image on their phone and submit it.

Here is what they came up with. But first: Some words from Enric Martí, the AP deputy director of photography who oversaw the project — and who had his doubts about it at the outset.

ENRIC MARTÍ, NEW YORK:

I didn't like this idea. At first.

You might call me a traditionalist. I've been a photographer for three decades and a photo editor for half that. I like negatives and the details they contain. I like physical things. I like full-on cameras. I liked the thought that went behind taking a 36-exposure roll of film and making tough choices about how to use each frame.

Sometimes I feel photography has almost lost the magic it had before the means to take a photo and share it with the world was in our pocket. Now, you can go for an assignment and easily take 3,000 frames.

And phones — everywhere, every day, millions of images. There is so much photography, and so much fake photography. You can buy a 99-cent app that removes people from photos. That's not photography to me; to me, photography is documenting what's really in the world.

But I'm changing my mind about phone photography — sort of. I've been trying for a while now to see and feel the positive side of this technological evolution, so I am not perceived as a ""dinosaur."" This project has helped me in that regard.

The photographers whose work is shown here are pros. Colleagues. People I admire. People whose images — from our ""work"" cameras — I see and edit all the time. But they are also people with phones, and with cameras in their phones, and that vision — the one they use so well in covering the news — comes out in very interesting ways. I asked them to observe things, and they did — each in a unique way.

In the end, I decided to add a photo of my own to this as well. Why not? I take them anyway, every day, on the street. I stopped carrying my ""real"" camera a long time ago, but I always have my phone. Which is kind of the point.

You go through life having to change. The world is moving quickly. You have to adapt. What else are you going to do?

NATACHA PISARENKO, BUENOS AIRES:

I use an iPhone instead of a camera on diverse occasions.

""Duna, the cat adopted months ago, loves all the noise and movement of these morning hours in his new home, so stands by the window and enjoys with curiosity this show for two hours until the calm arrives. My cameras were some place in the house, and I took the picture with my iPhone,"" wrote Pisarenko.

Sometimes it's as a reflex, when I see something I want to keep at that moment during my daily life. Sometimes it's just that I don't have a camera at hand, even though I'd want to. Sometimes I use the phone camera when I want to send an image immediately by message or WhatsApp — a way to communicate something to someone through an image and no words. Sometimes it's just something I want to keep.

The irony: My phone is so full that at the end, I scroll down the pictures erasing everything that does not mean that much to me. That way, I can keep using it as a camera or video recorder — and then erase it again.

DAR YASIN, NEW DELHI:

The photos now shot on the latest phones feel like digital art more than photographs. What you see with the naked eye is not what you get on your screen. And that for me is very unsettling. For example, the colors are oversaturated and look ""touched up"" when I have done nothing but pressed the shutter. The portrait mode produces blur but it's not the same effect my regular camera gives me. These pictures definitely don't evoke a similar thrill of a taking a good picture.

I'll admit that there are instances when I love the pictures taken on my iPhone. There is no denying the phone captures those moments very well indeed. But it's important to realize: The ""pro"" label on a phone doesn't necessarily make every owner a pro photographer.

On the contrary. The photographs on a smartphone are a product of machine learning, with the machine thinking and manipulating for you. It is also true that the iPhone is kind of setting a new 'standard' of what a photograph should look like — and I'm not sure that's a good thing.

RODRIGO ABD, BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA:

The phone allows me to practice street photography, a branch of photography that I like because it allows me to always be attentive to the everyday without a precise news event to cover, and with only the intention of documenting THE most banal moments of life. But at the end of the road will be a record of a vital moment in the life of society.

KHALIL HAMRA, ISTANBUL:

I used my iPhone to take this picture, which is what I do when I see a beautiful view and I am not carrying professional cameras. But I mostly use the iPhone camera to capture family memories. In all cases, the use of the phone does not eliminate the need for professional cameras, neither in the beauty of the picture nor in the pleasure of capturing it.

Truth be told, every time I take a nice picture with my phone, I feel that something is missing and could have been better if I took it with my professional camera.

EMILIO MORENATTI, BARCELONA, SPAIN:

For me, the use of the phone camera is just an alternative to my conventional camera, so I only use it on rare occasions and basically to photograph or capture on video family scenes or scenes with friends, with the simple idea of documenting banal moments.

Shooting with a camera is much more serious, and the result differs dramatically from shooting with a phone. Composing and capturing a scene through a viewfinder while pressing a shutter release is part of the essence of photography, and you can't do that with a phone yet. The flat image that a phone gives you can't compete with the photography you get from an SLR camera and a good lens, no matter how much phone photography lovers say otherwise.",2022-06-28 16:00:41,https://www.thedailystar.net/culture/art-design/photography/news/15-years-iphone-evolution-photography-3058821,2023-05-18 10:21:57,thedailystar
202,Man disguised as old woman throws cake at Mona Lisa,"A man seemingly disguised as an old woman in a wheelchair threw a piece of cake at the glass protecting the Mona Lisa at the Louvre Museum and shouted at people to think of planet Earth.

The Paris prosecutor's office said Monday that the 36-year-old man was detained following Sunday's incident and sent to a police psychiatric unit. An investigation has been opened into the damage of cultural artifacts.

Videos posted on social media showed a young man in a wig and lipstick who had arrived in a wheelchair. The man, whose identity was unknown, was also seen throwing roses in the museum gallery to slack-jawed guests.

The cake attack left a conspicuous white creamy smear on the glass but the famous work by Leonardo da Vinci wasn't damaged.

Security guards were filmed escorting the wig-wearing man away as he called out to the surprised visitors in the gallery: ""Think of the Earth! There are people who are destroying the Earth! Think about it. Artists tell you: think of the Earth. That's why I did this.""

Guards were then filmed cleaning the cake from the glass. A Louvre statement confirmed the attack on the artwork involving a ""patisserie.""

The 16th-century Renaissance masterpiece has seen a lot in its over-500 years in existence.

The painting was stolen in 1911 by a museum employee, an event which increased the painting's international fame. It was also damaged in an acid attack perpetrated by a vandal in the 1950s, and has since been kept behind glass.

In 2009, a Russian woman who was angry at not being able to get French citizenship threw a ceramic cup at it, smashing the cup but not harming the glass or the painting.",2022-05-30 15:04:27,https://www.thedailystar.net/culture/art-design/painting-illustration/news/man-disguised-old-woman-throws-cake-mona-lisa-3035466,2023-05-18 10:21:59,thedailystar

208,Renowned author Samaresh Majumdar no more,"Samaresh was best known for the series of novels Kalbela, Uttaradhikar, and Kalpurush

Eminent Bangla litterateur Samaresh Majumdar, whose popularity transcended the borders of Bangladesh and West Bengal, passed away yesterday at a private hospital in Kolkata in the evening, losing a protracted battle to a severe infection in the lungs and respiratory system.

The 79-year-old author, who had a long history of lung problems and breathing difficulties, died at around 6:00pm at the Apollo Hospital on EM Bypass Road in the eastern part of the city. He was admitted to the hospital on April 25 with complaints of brain haemorrhaging and thereafter developed breathing trouble.

The Apollo Hospital spokesperson said, Samaresh Majumdar had long been suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was recently admitted to the hospital with breathing problems.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called the death of Samaresh Majumdar ""An irreparable loss to Bengali literature.""

A prolific writer, Samaresh was best known for the series of novels featuring Animesh and Madhabilata as the lead characters in novels ""Kalbela"", ""Uttaradhikar"", and ""Kalpurush"" in the backdrop of the Naxalite movement in 1960s and 70s. Kalbela was brought on the big screen by acclaimed director Gautam Ghosh in 2009 with Parambrata Chattopadhyay and Paoli Dam in the lead roles.

Author of novels, short stories, and travelogues, Samaresh received the Indian government's coveted Sahitya Akademi award for the second book of the Animesh series, ""Kalbela"".

He is also credited with creating the character of detective Arjun. The Bangla film ""Buno Haansh"" is based on the novel written by Samaresh Majumdar of the same name.

Samaresh took the Bangla literary world by storm with his first novel ""Dour"" which was serialised in ""Desh"" magazine of Kolkata. It immediately earned him huge popularity. It was also made into a film in 1979.

Born on March 10, 1944, in Jalpaiguri in the northern part of West Bengal, Samaresh spent the first six years of his life in the terraced lush green tea gardens of the region. North Bengal forms a distinct and large part of his works.

After having primary education in Jalpaiguri high school, Samaresh shifted to Kolkata in the 1960s and obtained his BA honours degree from Scottish Church College and completed his post-graduation from Calcutta University.

Among the other novels by Samaresh are ""Saatkahon"", ""Swapner Bazar"", ""Ujaan"", ""Ganga"", ""Victoriar Bagan"", ""Aat Kuthuri Noy Dorja"", ""Anurag"", ""Tero Parban"", and ""Garbhadharini"". ""Saatkahon"" was adapted into a Bangla TV show.

In 1982, Samaresh was conferred Ananda Puraskar and declared an outstanding Bangali by ABP Ananda for his contribution to literature.

Samaresh's death plunged the Bangla literary world into the gloom.

Veteran writer Sirshendu Mukhopadhyay recalled his memories with Samaresh saying he had known Samaresh before he became an author. ""I used to stay at a boarding house in Kolkata and Samaresh used to come there. He was such a lively youth with diversified interests.""

Sirshendu said he had a special affinity with Samaresh because both were from north Bengal -- the former from Siliguri and the latter from Jalpaiguri.",2023-05-08 13:14:19,https://www.thedailystar.net/literature/news/renowned-author-samaresh-majumdar-no-more-3314411,2023-05-18 10:22:07,thedailystar

210,Gabriel García Márquez’s unseen novel will be published next year,"The author’s children were initially reluctant to publish a posthumous novel that was left unfinished, but they announced on Friday, May 5, that the work is “too precious to be hidden away”

Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez had left an unpublished manuscript that resided alongside his 10 published novels, 40 photo albums, 20 scrapbooks, two computers and typewriters. Journalist Patricia Lara Salive discovered parts of the unpublished story in these belongings—comprising over 40 cartons—after the University of Texas purchased some of Marquez's belongings in 2014.

Penguin Random House has announced that the novel, En Agosto Nos Vemos, (We'll See Each Other in August) will be published by Penguin Random House Spain in all Spanish speaking countries except Mexico in 2024.

The author's children were initially reluctant to publish a posthumous novel that was left unfinished, but they announced on Friday, May 5, that the work is ""too precious to be hidden away"".

The novel, which will span around 150 pages, tells the story of a woman named Ana Magdalena Bach, who visits a tropical island to lay flowers on her mother's grave, and ends up having an affair.

211,Tagore’s 'Shesher Kobita': A timeless exploration of love and freedom,"There are times I envy Labanya, sometimes I wish I could be as rebellious and as free-spirited as her; other times I feel empathy for her, it makes me believe and accept myself more as an individual

I first read Raktakarabi (Red Oleanders), a play by Rabindranath Tagore, at the end of my 'Playwriting' course. It turned out to be just the push button I needed. I stumbled upon Tagore's Shesher Kobita (Farewell Song, also referred to as The Last Poem) while preparing a 'Tagore Special TBR' for myself.

Shesher Kobita tells the story of a young man named Amit Raye, who falls in love with Labanya on a trip to a hill station. However, Labanya is engaged to another man, and their love remains unfulfilled. The novel explores themes such as love, desire, marriage, and the conflicts between tradition and modernity. Tagore's writing style is lyrical, ornamented by his use of metaphors and symbolism. The novel is full of poetic descriptions and vivid imagery, painting a dreamlike atmosphere. You can feel love floating around and caressing your soul while reading the text.

The novel, to this day, resonates with readers because it deals with complex philosophical ideas. The characters in the novel are torn between their desires and the expectations of society. Amit, in particular, struggles to reconcile his desire for love and freedom with his sense of duty and responsibility. The plot explores the tension between individual desire and social norms and the consequences of choosing one over the other. Even though it is a love story, the narrative paints a rather rational picture instead of the typical ""happily-ever-after"" conclusion many love stories tend to show.

Another notable aspect of the novella being a thought-provoking one is the manner in which Labanya, its female protagonist, is depicted. Unlike many other works of literature from the time, Tagore presents his woman characters as complex and multifaceted. Labanya is intelligent, independent, and passionate, she possesses a personality beyond the confines of traditional gender roles. She refuses to be defined solely by her role as a wife or daughter and seeks to live life on her own terms. As a woman reader, I experienced an array of emotions simultaneously playing at each other the multiple times I read this text. There are times I envy Labanya, sometimes I wish I could be as rebellious and as free-spirited as her; other times I feel empathy for her, it makes me believe and accept myself more as an individual, leading my own story with grace.

Shesher Kobita is a sorrowful and moving story that speaks to the human experience of loss, separation, and longing.

When I asked my brother-in-law what had tempted him to read it 13 times, he had a very simple response: the way in which the characters were developed, their romance, and the narrative itself had encouraged him to read more of Robi Thakur. It brought him to the Ekushey Boi Mela and collected his other, well known titles as well as the lesser known ones.

Tagore's ability to grasp fundamental human feelings and articulate them in a way that connects with readers across countries and centuries is what makes his work so ageless. His writing is distinguished by its simplicity, grace, and depth, and he possessed a rare ability to use language to generate powerful, evocative images that stay with readers long after they have finished reading. His notable contributions to literature have one thing in common: universality. The themes of love, nature, loss, longing, and care in the works are as pertinent today as they were when they were first written, and their emotional intensity is just as real and refreshing and will remain as such till the end of time. Tagore's writing demonstrates the potential of great literature to transcend time and place, touching the hearts and minds of readers of all ages. His works are true masterpieces of world literature, inspiring and moving readers all over the world.

In celebrating the Nobel laureate's 162nd birthday, I keep asking myself if Tagore was ahead of his time or if his vision of a future where women were well read and educated enough to challenge stereotypical societal norms has materialised over the decades. He wrote extensively about women's experiences, struggles, and desires, challenging the traditional patriarchal norms of his society. His depiction of women was not limited to a particular archetype, but rather portrayed as multi-dimensional characters with diverse personalities and life experiences. When you read Tagore's works–be it a poem, play, short story, song or a novel–you not only fall in love with the characters and narrative, you start respecting them too, to the point that you feel a profound respect for Rabindranath each time you read his work of art.

212,"So, ChatGPT can write? Ahem!","ChatGPT begins the dark dawn of writing with serious ethical and intellectual consequences in the days ahead

The correlation between writing and technology is as old as writing, for writing IS technology. Technological advances such as papyrus, the printing press, the mechanical pencil, the fountain pen, and the typewriter have complemented writing. Writing and technology are not exclusive. Despite being a technology, writing remains manual and human. Writing is labour, in which the body and the brain participate. Likewise, composition professional Donald Murray claims that writing is an intellectual activity carried out in an emotional environment. Writing, then, presupposes both cognition and affect that humans embody. Technologies that underpin writing embrace these dimensions of writing. ChatGPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformers) does not. Therefore, a conflict between writing and technology has ensued worldwide, when OpenAI released ChatGPT this past November.

While writing and technology are not exclusive, ChatGPT is. It's a predatory technology that threatens to subvert writing. It doesn't ease writing as all technologies do; it, instead, writes itself. And it promises to write everything. Writers, by contrast, are limited by their interests and expertise. A writer doesn't–and can't–write everything. Writers are genre sticklers. Ernest Hemingway, for example, had nothing to do with science fiction and philosophy. Steven Pinker has nothing to do with novels and poetry. No writer is ambidextrous. ChatGPT is. As such, it re-defines writing built on the foundational flaw that humans can write anything, anytime. And because ChatGPT is a model (i.e., Large Language Model, LLM) based on algorithms, it's science. Disregarding it on the surface seems to be doltish. Nevertheless, Noam Chomsky, Ian Roberts, and Jeffrey Watumull regard ChatGPT as ""faux science"" in their pitch, ""The False Promise of ChatGPT,"" in The New York Times.

Writers are genre sticklers. Ernest Hemingway, for example, had nothing to do with science fiction and philosophy. Steven Pinker has nothing to do with novels and poetry. No writer is ambidextrous. ChatGPT is. As such, it re-defines writing built on the foundational flaw that humans can write anything, anytime.

It is indeed so given that the science of writing has a neurobiological dimension that ChatGPT disregards. Writing is an adult engagement. Research in neuroscience establishes that the human brain is not adult enough until the second decade of our life, when it completes neural wiring. Even when the brain is developed, different activities are undertaken by either of the brain's two hemispheres–maths for the left hemisphere, for example. Gabrielle Rico claims in Writing the Natural Way (1983) that writing is a unique activity that must engage both the hemispheres of the human brain. Writing that endures combines both the critical intelligence of the left hemisphere and the creative excellence of the right hemisphere. Influential composition professional Peter Elbow also claims that excellent writing utilises a synergy between first-order thinking (i.e., intuitive, creative) and second-order thinking (conscious, directed, controlled). Because these attributes of writing are neurobiologically determined and specific to adults, everyone is not meant to produce compact and compelling prose. With ChatGPT, anyone who writes a prompt, writes. This is zany!

That's because writing presupposes pre-writing. It is one of the most critical phases of writing (the other two are: writing and rewriting), which consumes about 85 percent of our time and energy in a writing task, as composition professional Donald Murray claims. Pre-writing involves researching, brainstorming, consulting sources, and sequencing the various stages of writing. The physical act of writing flows from a frame of mind, which swings between procrastination and creative tensions during pre-writing. Skipping pre-writing warrants re-defining writing, because pre-writing situates writing in the cognitive and emotional meshwork that humans are endowed with. Pre-writing is the soul of writing. The version of writing that ChatGPT spits out emerges independent of it. It writes instantly, uninterrupted. It is unfamiliar with the ""wise passiveness"" that William Wordsworth urges in his poem, ""Expostulation and Reply"". Over his desk, likewise, Franz Kafka had one word, ""Wait."" That's what all writers do. ChatGPT doesn't! So, it doesn't write. It, instead, manufactures writing.

As a consequence, ChatGPT is a scourge to have around. It denigrates the discipline of composition studies, for it's a clear case of disciplinary trespassing. Composition studies is an independent discipline with intellectual and pedagogical agendas. Its knowledge base is expansive, as it heavily draws from the rhetorical traditions of ancient Greece. Composition professionals are specialised scholars. They know the patois of their guild. They know that the best-kept secret for the discipline doesn't lie in cracking some engineering codes. Writing, rather, is problem-solving through a sense of judgement mediated by language. Statisticising writing as an informed guesswork–as ChatGPT does–is insular and romantic. The architects of ChatGPT are criminally innocent about the options and restrictions of writing. ChatGPT as such is a wrong thing coming from the wrong people exploited by the wrong people. It's an example of technological turpitude, which we all are victims of these days. ChatGPT threatens to re-define writing, which is the work of ""a noiseless, patient spider,"" as Walt Whitman implicitly claims in his titular poem. ChatGPT begins the dark dawn of writing with serious ethical and intellectual consequences in the days ahead.

Matthew Kirschenbaum, in his pitch, ""Prepare for the Textpocalypse"" in The Atlantic, apprehends that we might quickly find ourselves facing a textpocalypse, where machine-written language becomes the norm and human-written prose the exception. Because machines surpass humans in speed and productivity, we may soon be swept away by a tsunami of stilted and trite text. Consequently, language degenerates. Thinking diminishes. Civic discourse coarsens. Aesthetics cowers to conveniences. Human agency and intent recede. What emerges under such a circumstance is not writing whatsoever. It's, instead, a synthetic patchwork that ChatGPT does. Writers are pack rats, who know, understand, and contemplate ""the best that has been thought and said,"" as Matthew Arnold suggests in Culture and Anarchy (1869). And authentic writers write with soul, as Rachel Toor claims in her essay ""Writing with Soul,"" in the Chronicle of Higher Education. ChatGPT can't write with soul, for it doesn't have sentience. When, then, ChatGPT goes mainstream, and machine-generated prose metastasizes further, we will hardly believe anything we would read on or off line. That portends an ethical and a human crisis.

Despite these essential shortcomings, how does ChatGPT gain ground in writing? Writing is not glib scripting. Writing is breathing life into words generating taut prose that informs, inspires, and enlightens. While the basic tool of a writer's trade is words, a writer is not a mere wordsmith. Writers are deep thinkers, extensive readers, and compulsive editors of their writing. These attributes that underpin writing are not natural. These are habitual. Most people do not know about the habits writers cultivate. Neither do they want to form the habits themselves, because it requires an unwavering commitment to investing time and energy to master the craft of writing. As such, our academic or intellectual development is often not commensurate with the development of writing skill. Our vulnerability with writing continues to compound. The architects of ChatGPT used this fault line to come up with the kitschy attempt to take the sting out of writing. They can't do so, because writing is ""back-breaking, mind-breaking work,"" as Mark Edmundson claims in Why Write? (Bloomsbury USA, 2016). ChatGPT is vulnerability and ignorance commodified. If we would collectively resist a vaccine invented by a group of historians to deal with a fatal virus causing a pandemic, why won't we resist a cure-all writing app from a group of technology boffins from Silicon Valley? There's no correlation between expertise and invention here. The connection, therefore, between ChatGPT and writing is apocryphal.

So, it's a sobering time for writers and writing professionals. Written words continue to mean less and less these days, for we're becoming a culture of images. Because we can show and see almost everything, we no longer have to use words to know about the world. An author is no longer an authority, because she is not rare and exceptional. On the internet, everyone is a scribe. Consequently, the gap between writing and typing is already significantly reduced. With ChatGPT around, the gap between writing and typing diminishes further. As it turns out, everyone is a writer, and everything is writing. That's lunatic, toxic thinking. ChatGPT as such unleashes unqualified violence against writing and writers. Writers and writing professionals are artists, who are pushed, or who push themselves, to a time of apprehension and uncertainty. Toni Morrison avers in her essay, ""No Place for Self-Pity, No Room for Fear,"" in The Nation, that artists must not choose to remain silent in times of dread. She further claims, ""There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak, we write, we do language. That is how civilizations heal."" Are we speaking and writing enough contra ChatGPT to heal our civilisation that it threatens to disrupt?

I wish we did! Technology is so widespread these days that we always see what technology has done to our civilisation. Hardly do we think about what technology has undone already. Physicist Robert Oppenheimer used to lament that he had blood on his hands because of his involvement with the Manhattan Project, leading to the development of the atom bomb. The world has never been the same ever since. What the atom bomb is to the world is ChatGPT to writing. Our relationship with writing will never again be the same. Trust me. I'm a composition professional. I know what I am talking about.

213,An odd memory in Dhaka city,"Dhaka street food has taught me better than to go by the look of things

The only thing I like about this city is the thought of leaving it. And I was leaving it finally, after one and a half months, my longest stretch of stay in the last three years. Juggling my luggage with one hand and my phone with the other to get Google Maps directions while I balance myself on the rickshaw racing through bumpy Dhaka roads–it is a metaphor that sums up my life in this city.

It was 11:15 PM at night, and the roads were empty.

I was surprised, pleasantly, to see my favourite tea stall open at this hour. Without stopping the rickshaw, I halted right in front of Shohagh bus counter after a fierce ride through the wrong side of the road. I suppose that's what Dhaka is—a city of rule breakers.

I got a print of my e-ticket and headed into the waiting room only to experience the dearth of decency in this city's men. One of the passengers, oblivious to the possibility that someone might be trying to reach the empty seats to his right, stretched his legs and blocked my way as if the way forward were his kingdom. I heard an ""Excuse me"" from behind and realised that while recounting the infinitude of Dhaka's inconveniences, I too was adding to it by blocking someone else's way. It was time to retire to one of the seats.

I got up and headed out after a while, and my memory dug out the story of how my dad's bag had gotten stolen in a bus counter once.

It was yet to dawn when my dad, a young doctor at the time, reached Dhaka for a professional exam. He was alone, and the attention-sucking smartphone hadn't yet been invented. When another man, possibly a fellow passenger, struck up a conversation, Baba was happily engaged until the sun rose and it was time for him to leave the counter. Surely, he could ask the amiable stranger to look after his luggage for a few minutes–a bag full of his clothes, books, and important documents like his admit card.

When he returned, the man and the bag both were gone.

I didn't ask anyone to look after my bag when leaving the bus. I didn't want the inconvenience of walking around with luggage either. It was 11:39 PM and my bus was scheduled to leave in six minutes. Factoring in the usual delay, I had around 10 minutes in my mind. Dragging a bag along would have slowed me down. I left it there and hastened my steps.

I crossed the road, walked ahead, then turned left. The yellow lights smiled welcomingly against the night backdrop. A sign became clearer: ""Ekhane khati gorur dudher cha pawa jay"". Not everything about this city is bad, I thought. And I wanted a sip of goodness before I left.

The first time I stumbled upon this shop, I was in a confused state; left befuddled by Google Maps' directions. It had dragged me into a constricted back alley in Kalabagan and then kept asking me to step into someone's private property, while my intended destination was a commercial building by the main road. I was forced to do away with Maps and reverse my way out of the alley. That's when, to my right, I saw milk being stirred in a half-moon korai. My heart had already started swimming in it. Dhaka street food has taught me better than to go by the look of things. But I ordered a cup nonetheless. It was winter, and the smoke wafting from the clay cups into the post-Maghrib fog wouldn't let me down even if the taste of the tea did.

One sip was enough to wash down all my scepticism. Ever since then, I have been coming here whenever I have the luxury of time on my fortnightly visits back home to Chattogram.

The shopkeeper smiles with recognition and apology when I walk in this time. The thick black iron pot that slowly sediments malai is in its usual place. But the pot is empty and the low flame extinguished. They don't make tea this late at night. I start walking back to the bus.

I keep returning to this city out of obligation. But this tea might make me voluntarily come to Dhaka someday. My thoughts don't keep up with my footsteps.

I'm back at the counter and no one has stolen my bag.

A droid like programmed manacle

Needing job, bounty hunting.

A comet revolving across the galaxies;

The armored mercenary, as he pierces through

The Homeric world of Iliad,

An Achilles, the uncompromised warlord,

How doleful he razed against Agamemnon for bounty!

The heart, wandering across the Sub-Sahara,

Over the mountain top, floating through

Thick and thin, rests at razor's edge.

Home? It is where the heart is!

What a bliss, that a cactus

Is drenched by the drippings from heaven,

An unparalleled sentiment in deserts!

The Mando, having more pressing matters

To protect the kid, no bounty, no task ordained

To him. He loves its cooing, its soft forehead,

Appealing spell cast by the marveled eyes.

Who dares to let them apart, as he quested

The burden to carry?

A father-the sphinx, embryonic off the ashes-!

The beat accompanying the heart,

In its systolic and diastolic pressure,

The Echo following Narcissus

Repeating! Repeating! Repeating with the last words!

215,"In conversation with South Asia’s preeminent literary agent, Kanishka Gupta","If you're writing fiction, ask yourself, why should someone invest money in it, edit it, publish it? Will this story have a wider resonance?

As an editor—emerging or experienced—one of the truths you swallow on the job everyday is that editing is a backstage job, integral and constantly mutating, unnoticed, with the hour's need. You tease out an idea almost at the tip of the author's tongue (fingers?), probe them to reckon with the perspectives they're bringing to a work, look into the research, the formatting, the promoting—all the less romantic parts of getting a piece of writing out into the world. The labour of these tasks hangs hidden, in the spaces between the sentences we read in print, on our phones and computer screens.

If the job of the editor contains dozens of these tasks, the literary agent performs perhaps tenfold of that. It is the agent who, in mature publishing ecosystems around the world, guides the author through the stages of finding the right editor, preparing the manuscript for the right publisher, and then marketing the book to the right readers, all while protecting the author's legal, financial and creative interests.

Kanishka Gupta is a literary agent who founded Writers Side, Asia's largest literary agency based in India, and some of the authors he represents have been at the forefront of literary conversations in recent years, his and their work having taken South Asian literature to a global stage. Shehan Karunatilaka, Sri Lankan author of the Booker Prize winning The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida, is represented by Kanishka in South Asia for The Birth Lottery and Other Stories as well as his forthcoming novel. Daisy Rockwell, translator of the International Booker Prize winning Tomb of Sand, is represented by Kanishka for all her work globally, as is Geetanjali Shree, the author of Tomb of Sand, for the English translation of some of her backlist titles within the subcontinent. The list also includes Avni Doshi, the Booker Prize shortlisted author of Girl in White Cotton, Numair Atif Chowdhury, Bangladeshi author of the majestic, posthumously published Babu Bangladesh, and Iffat Nawaz, the Pondicherry-based Bangladeshi author of Shurjo's Clan, among others.

In person, Kanishka is as humble as his authors are prominent. It is his passion for storytelling that comes through in conversation, alongside an instinctive, entirely self-taught (and, in his words, utterly bizarre) understanding of the publishing system. Something interesting happens when I begin our virtual interview—unlike the authors, journalists, publishers and artists I normally have to ease into talking about their work, Kanishka rattles off answers to most of my questions about the South Asian publishing scene before I even have a chance to ask them.

What does the agent do for the author?

It marries a lot of professions—you're a reader, lawyer, counsellor, editor, friend.

An agent should have a very good understanding of the market and the requirements of all the editors and publishing houses. I would not want to work with an agent who has access to just one publisher in different houses in India—there are 8-10 commissioning editors at HarperCollins and Penguin, and each one of them is looking for a certain genre. Some of them are looking for a certain kind of book within a genre. So the agent should have a very good knowledge of publishing trends, of what kinds of books are selling.

At the same time, an agent should not be mercenary, they should not say no to good manuscripts just because they feel like it will face a lot of resistance from publishers. You have to be passionate about the book and sometimes you have to be okay with knowing that a book will not do well. But sometimes an auction that starts at 1 lakh can end with 10 lakh.

Authors also expect us to be very proactive about pitching their books to OTT platforms. And then you obviously have to make sure the contract protects the interests of the author in terms of the copyright, the royalty percentage, that there are no clauses which sound shady, etc.

What do you look for in a manuscript, and how does that differ between genres?

Fiction is a very instinctive thing. Short stories are as hard to sell as poetry. But with fiction we make sure that the most fundamental things are correct—the quality of writing, storytelling; even if it is experimental, it should not be so for the sake of experimentation, and it has to be original. I'm happy to take works of fiction or creative nonfiction that work with hackneyed storylines as long as it's done in a new way. For instance, there are so many mother-daughter feminist narratives floating around, but some of them are done in such a fresh way.

If it's political nonfiction or biography, the research is more important than the writing. If it is a book on a historical figure or event, I like to ask the author what new thing he/she is bringing to the table.

So you've said yes to a manuscript. What happens next?

Sometimes we say a provisional yes—they work on it and get back to us. If we feel that it's next to impossible to pitch the book in its current state and we don't have the editorial and financial wherewithal to edit in house, we recommend freelance editors. If we're convinced after the authors come back, we do a standard author-agent agreement.

There are authors who want me to represent them in India only; some of them want me to represent them globally. There are authors who have 2-3 representatives in South Asia or globally.

So after the contract we do the pitch note—it's somewhere between a synopsis and the book jacket blurb. We work on the author bio, making sure that it focuses on the author's writing credentials and not just their achievements. Sometimes if we feel that a book is a hard sell, we get authors to prepare marketing plans. Then you kind of nudge other publishers and tell them that we've got other offers and give them a deadline for a response.

The publishing side usually takes 10-14 months.

I always tell the authors to make subjective, qualitative decisions. So many of my authors say no to higher offers from publishing houses if they don't feel comfortable with the publisher or editor. Some of them want to work with editors who are more hungry because they are new themselves.

What are some of the things an emerging or aspiring author should know about the publishing process?

Read a lot of books. If you're writing fiction, ask yourself, why should someone invest money in it, edit it, publish it? Will this story have a wider resonance? Or is it just a form of catharsis for you?

The story needs to have a universality, finesse in the plotting. Your research sources have to be more than Google search. You should have travelled to the places where some of your characters or stories are set.

Be open to feedback, don't be in a hurry to publish.

And—maybe this is a controversial statement—don't hero worship 2-3 writers and emulate their styles, and don't get so swayed by market forces that you are not experimenting enough. Just write.

Tell me about your work with Numair Atif Chowdhury and Babu Bangladesh.

Numair was introduced to me by Nadeem Zaman. He was not dismissive of me, nor was he reluctant. But for the longest time he was very wary of sharing the draft of Babu Bangladesh with anyone from publishing.

When I visited Dhaka after Numair's death to chair a session on Babu Bangladesh, I found his thesis for the novel at Lubna's house. You'll be surprised that there were not too many changes in that draft from 2007 or 08—we're talking about 8-10 years before the manuscript.

We had several conversations and it took me a long time to get the manuscript out of him, which would mean that he would have to let me read it. So the draft came to me. In a day—and it was a working day—I spent half of it reading the text, while I was supposed to be responding to mail and calls. A lot of people say that parts of the book feel like nonfiction. That's the compulsive, hypnotic quality of the book.

Numair eventually said yes but he was not willing to do any paperwork. He was also teaching in a university and I remember he was deeply disturbed about the political unrest, the attacks on students that happened in 2018. I think somewhere down the line he started worrying about his safety because of the nature of the book—because it is explosive.

He passed away, and then I was very nervous that the book would go to someone else. I was also anxious to reach out to the family at a time like that. And this is where relationships come in—I repitched to the family.

Numair comes from a family of intellectuals and avid readers, they are very particular about quality, and they were very closely involved in the process [of it getting published]. The book was pitched and immediately I got an offer. None of them told us to make any changes. But I'm pretty sure that Numair would've wanted to work on it a little more.

Who else are you working with from Bangladesh?

I've just signed a collection of 14-15 stories by Kazi Nazrul Islam, who is also very big in India. His grandson is translating a selection of his stories culled from the short story collection. Not much is known about his short fiction. A lot of it is set during World War time and it's also about the experiences in the regiment. These are formative years so it's a glimpse into the factors that turned him into this poet.

Noor Jahan Bose's Daughter of the Agunmukha is out in July or August, published by Hurst Publishers and translated by Rebecca Whittington. Hurst is very excited about this book—it's basically her life written in a very novelistic way.

I represent Rifat Munim now, who is translating a novel by Shaheen Akhtar. There is also Phantom of the August, a novel by Mashrur Arefin translated by Arunava Sinha which will be published by Vintage India.

Shah Tazrian Ashrafi [a writer for Daily Star Books] is just 20 years old and he is writing short stories! His book was picked up by Hachette India and it'll probably get a global deal.

Among the writers I've worked with, I seriously feel that Babu Bangladesh was on another level. I liked Shurjo's Clan—it's the kind of book that can appeal to a large readership and Iffat has worked quite hard on it.

I do admire the works of Saad Hussain—he's wacky and has a lot of flair even though it's difficult to make it as a speculative writer. I have great admiration for Leesa Gazi, Shabnam Nadiya.

What's your take on plagiarism in South Asia? It's become especially common in Bangladesh.

I think it's very bad in Bangladesh. I know Indian publishers refuse to let go of Bangladeshi rights because they feel that their books will be pirated. Publishing houses in Bangladesh have approached Indian publishers asking if they can print a novel in Bangla so that there is better distribution in Bangladesh. Every single time, there is only one reason cited for why the Indian publisher did not agree: piracy.

Piracy is quite rampant in some of the Indian language publishing scenes too. Forget pirated editions, PDFs are being distributed on WhatsApp.

The change has to happen at a government level. This is an industry which is not even recognised as an industry in India. There is increased GST on ink, on royalty—authors don't even want to publish in hardback anymore. I tell some authors to go for a paperback because for a new writer, the book will not sell at Rs 799. So the authors also need to be sensitised to this.

How has all this experience of working with books changed your sensibilities as a writer and reader?

It's killed the writer in me! All the time you're talking to writers who are, sometimes justifiably, convinced that their book is the greatest book ever. This is the kind of conviction that you hear day in and day out. So I don't have any writerly ego left. It has not been conducive to me as a writer.

But I do feel that in the long run, when I take a break—and I will—the richness of the books I've read, the people I've met and the encounters I've had by virtue of being a publishing professional will make me a much finer writer.

I don't find much time for pleasure reading but I've become very discerning. I do want to take a break and read the kind of books that I like to read—literary and experimental fiction. I don't like reading science fiction.

I think we don't read with that sense of lightness and wonder anymore, I don't find the time for this.

But one of the books that really stayed with me is called The Piano Teacher by Elfriede Jelinek. From South Asia one of my favourites is Temporary People by Deepak Unnikrishnan—experimental, crazy stories about the immigrant experience.

217,Adherence to a “Mediterranean lifestyle” prevents metabolic syndrome,"A study published in the Journal of Internal Medicine found that following a Mediterranean lifestyle, which includes adopting a Mediterranean diet along with healthy lifestyle practices like sufficient rest, regular physical activity, and social interaction, is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease in individuals without a history of cardiovascular problems.

In a recent report, researchers analysed data from 851 patients in the CORDIOPREV study (Coronary Diet Intervention with Olive Oil and Cardiovascular Prevention) and divided them into groups based on their adherence to the Mediterranean lifestyle over 5 years. The patients were assessed for metabolic syndrome, which includes several metabolic features such as abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol and blood sugar levels.

After 5 years, the study found that those who had the highest adherence to the Mediterranean lifestyle were less likely to develop new cases of metabolic syndrome and more likely to reverse pre-existing metabolic syndrome compared to those with the lowest adherence. Following the Mediterranean diet alone was associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome. However, the non-dietary components of the Mediterranean lifestyle did not show the same association.

The results suggest that a Mediterranean diet, along with managing risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome, can contribute to the prevention of adverse cardiovascular events. These risk factors can be easily monitored in clinical practice.",2023-05-13 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/news/adherence-mediterranean-lifestyle-prevents-metabolic-syndrome-3319771,2023-05-18 10:22:19,thedailystar
218,Understanding deep vein thrombosis,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition characterised by the formation of a blood clot deep within a vein, typically in the leg. It affects a significant number of people globally, and it can be life-threatening. The concern with DVT is that fragments of the blood clot can break off and travel through the bloodstream. If one of these fragments becomes lodged in the lungs, it can obstruct blood flow, potentially leading to organ damage or even death.

Symptoms: One common symptom of DVT is the swelling of the leg below the knee. Additionally, the affected area may exhibit redness, tenderness, or pain. However, it's important to note that these symptoms may not always be present. Approximately half of individuals with DVT do not experience any warning signs.

Causes: DVT can be caused by various factors that lead to damage to the inner lining of a vein. These factors include surgery, injury, or immune system responses. Conditions that cause thick or slow-flowing blood increase the likelihood of clot formation, particularly in veins that have already been damaged. Additionally, individuals with specific genetic disorders or higher levels of oestrogen are at an increased risk of developing blood clots.

Certain individuals are more likely to develop DVT. These include:

• Individuals with a history of cancer

• Those who have undergone surgery

• People on prolonged bed rest

• Older individuals

• Smokers

• Individuals who are overweight or obese

• Those who engage in prolonged periods of sitting, such as during long airplane flights

Pregnancy: During pregnancy and the 4 to 6 weeks following childbirth, women are at an increased risk of developing DVT. This is attributed to higher levels of oestrogen during this period, which can potentially increase the likelihood of blood clot formation. The pressure exerted by the expanding uterus can also contribute to reduced blood flow in the veins. Moreover, certain blood disorders further elevate the risk of DVT in pregnant women.

Hormone therapy: Hormone therapy, including the use of birth control pills and certain treatments for postmenopausal symptoms, can elevate the levels of oestrogen in a woman's bloodstream. This increase in oestrogen can potentially raise the risk of developing DVT.

Trapped in your seat: While traveling to new and distant destinations can be an exciting experience, sitting in a confined seat for an extended period during long-distance travel, such as a trip lasting over 4 hours, can be uncomfortable. Research indicates that prolonged travel doubles the risk of developing DVT, regardless of whether it is by air, bus, train, or car. When you remain seated in a cramped position without much movement, it can lead to slowed blood flow.

Diagnosis: To diagnose DVT, doctors will conduct a thorough examination, including assessing for signs and symptoms. They will also inquire about your medical history, medications you are currently taking, any relevant medical conditions in your close relatives, as well as factors that could increase your risk of developing DVT. The most common method used to confirm the presence of DVT is an ultrasound, which utilizes sound waves to visualise blood flow and identify blood clots. In some cases, additional tests such as a d-dimer blood test may be necessary.

Compression stockings are specialised socks that apply gentle pressure on your legs, promoting blood circulation. They help prevent the formation of blood clots, reduce swelling, and alleviate pain in areas where a clot has formed. While you can purchase compression stockings over the counter, stockings with higher pressure require a prescription from your doctor. It is recommended to wear them consistently, even when at home.

In addition, elevating your legs by keeping your feet raised off the floor whenever possible can be beneficial. This position facilitates the upward flow of blood from your veins towards your heart, reducing swelling and discomfort in the leg affected by DVT.",2023-05-13 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/news/understanding-deep-vein-thrombosis-3319441,2023-05-18 10:22:20,thedailystar
219,A kind road to happiness (2),"The sharing and ventilating of personal feelings play a major role in the relief of stress and depression. It has been seen that people who have one or more close friendships appear to be happier.

Kindness and friendliness are both a skill and a value. One of the greatest paradoxes in modern life is that while, on average, existence has become more consumer-oriented over time, sacrificing attitude with happiness has fallen. But at the end of the day, most world scholars found that people should focus on others first and themselves second.

Acts of kindness can only make the world a happier place for everyone as the standard pillars of kindness sound and mean universally. They can boost feelings of confidence, being in control, happiness, and optimism. Being kind boosts serotonin and dopamine, which are neurotransmitters in the brain that give us feelings of satisfaction with happiness and well-being and cause the pleasure or reward centers in our brain to light up. Endorphins - our body's natural painkillers, also can be released. There was a research study done in Japan that showed that happy people were kinder than people who were not happy.

There is a strong connection between our own happiness and being kinder to others; Kindness is one of the most important qualities a person can have. It could be the only road towards personal to global peace and happiness.

The thing that counts most in the pursuit of happiness is choosing the right factor named kindness. That is why it is said that 'kindness is the essential ingredient for the recipe for happiness'.

220,Repeat MRI scans for pituitary microadenomas may be unnecessary: study suggests,"Autopsy and imaging studies have shown that around 10% of adults may have pituitary microadenomas, which are small growths in the pituitary gland. These growths are often found incidentally during an MRI scan and are usually less than 10mm in size. Researchers at the Mass General Brigham healthcare system studied 177 patients who had pituitary microadenomas and at least one follow-up MRI scan. Patients with high levels of prolactin hormone were excluded from the study.

At the start of the study, the average size of the microadenomas was 4mm. During a follow-up period of about 5 years, the size of the microadenomas stayed the same in 44% of patients, increased in 28%, decreased in 19%, and increased but later decreased in 9%. Larger microadenomas tended to decrease in size with time, while smaller ones tended to increase in size.

However, the average increase in size for the smaller microadenomas was very small, only 0.1 mm per year. Only three microadenomas grew to be larger than 10mm during the study period. Based on the findings, it appears that frequent follow-up MRIs for patients with incidentally discovered pituitary microadenomas may not be necessary.

The researchers suggest a somewhat arbitrary schedule of repeating MRIs at 1, 4, and 9 years, assuming the initial lesion has not increased in size. However, it is important to note that if patients develop symptoms such as changes in peripheral vision, it is advisable to seek prompt evaluation regardless of the scheduled follow-up.",2023-05-13 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/disease/research/news/repeat-mri-scans-pituitary-microadenomas-may-be-unnecessary-study-suggests-3319046,2023-05-18 10:22:22,thedailystar
221,Neglected 80-year-old antibiotic is effective against multi-drug resistant bacteria,"A recent study published in the journal PLOS Biology suggests that an old antibiotic could be a valuable weapon against drug-resistant bacterial infections. The research, conducted by James Kirby and his team from Harvard Medical School, explores the potential of an antibiotic called nourseothricin, which was discovered in the 1940s but was abandoned due to kidney toxicity.

Nourseothricin is derived from a soil fungus and contains multiple forms of a complex molecule known as streptothricin. Gram-negative bacteria, which have a tough outer protective layer, are particularly difficult to treat with common antibiotics. Previous studies on nourseothricin were limited due to incomplete purification of the streptothricins. However, recent research has revealed that one of its forms, streptothricin-F, is significantly less toxic to kidneys while still showing high activity against drug-resistant bacteria.

In their study, the researchers investigated the antibacterial action, renal toxicity, and mechanism of action of highly purified forms of two streptothricins, D and F. They found that the D form was more potent against drug-resistant bacteria, but also caused renal toxicity at a lower dose. Both forms displayed a strong preference for Gram-negative bacteria.

Using cryo-electron microscopy, the researchers discovered that streptothricin-F, one of the forms of nourseothricin, binds extensively to a specific part of the bacterial ribosome. This binding mechanism leads to translation errors in the bacteria, which is known to be caused by these types of antibiotics. What is interesting is that the binding interaction of streptothricin-F is different from other known translation inhibitors, suggesting it could be useful when those other agents are not effective.

Based on the unique and promising activity of streptothricin-F, lead researcher James Kirby stated that the streptothricin scaffold should be further investigated in pre-clinical studies as a potential treatment for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. He also mentioned that streptothricin, isolated in 1942, was the first antibiotic to demonstrate potent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The research team found that not only is streptothricin highly potent, but it also effectively targets contemporary multidrug-resistant pathogens and operates through a unique mechanism of inhibiting protein synthesis.",2023-05-13 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/healthcare/research/news/neglected-80-year-old-antibiotic-effective-against-multi-drug-resistant-bacteria-3319031,2023-05-18 10:22:24,thedailystar

224,Smokers urged to swap cigarettes for vapes in world first scheme,"As part of the world-first national scheme, almost 1 in 5 of all smokers in England will be provided with a vape starter kit alongside behavioural support to help them quit the habit as part of a series of new measures to help the government meet its ambition of being smokefree by 2030 - reducing smoking rates to 5% or less. Local authorities will be invited to take part in the scheme later this year and each will design a scheme which suits its needs, including deciding which populations to prioritise.

In a speech, Health Minister Neil O'Brien also announced that following the success of local schemes, pregnant women will be offered financial incentives to help them stop smoking. This involves offering vouchers, alongside behavioural support, to all pregnant women who smoke by the end of next year.

The government also consulted on introducing mandatory cigarette pack inserts with positive messages and information to help people to quit smoking.

Additionally, there will be a crackdown on illicit vape sales as part of measures to stop children and non-smokers take up the habit - which is growing in popularity among young people.

Supporting more women to have a smoke free pregnancy will reduce the number of babies born underweight or underdeveloped with health problems requiring neonatal and ongoing care. It will also reduce the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth.

227,1 pregnant woman or newborn dies every 7 seconds: WHO,"Due to declining spending on maternal and newborn health, global progress in lowering the early mortality of pregnant women, mothers, and babies has stagnated for eight years, said a new UN World Health Organization (WHO) report.

The report, titled ""Improving maternal and newborn health and survival and reducing stillbirth,"" analyzes the most recent statistics, which share similar risk factors and causes, and tracks the provision of critical health services.

The new publication was launched at a major global conference in Cape Town, South Africa.

Overall, the analysis demonstrates that improvements in survival have stalled since 2015, as evidenced by the annual average of 290,000 maternal fatalities, 1.9 million stillbirths (babies who die after 28 weeks of pregnancy), and a startling 2.3 million infant deaths during the first month of life.

The report shows that over 4.5 million women and babies die every year during pregnancy, childbirth or the first weeks after birth, equivalent to one death happening every seven seconds. Most of the deaths were from preventable or treatable causes if proper care was available.

The COVID-19 pandemic, rising poverty, and worsening humanitarian crises have intensified pressures on stretched health systems. Just one in 10 countries (of more than 100 surveyed) report having sufficient funds to implement their current plans.

According to the latest WHO survey on the pandemic's impacts on essential health services, around 25 per cent of countries still report ongoing disruptions to vital pregnancy and postnatal care and services for sick children.

""Pregnant women and newborns continue to die at unacceptably high rates worldwide, and the COVID-19 pandemic has created further setbacks to providing them with the healthcare they need,"" said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing at the World Health Organization (WHO).

""If we wish to see different results, we must do things differently. More and smarter investments in primary healthcare are needed now so that every woman and baby -- no matter where they live -- has the best chance of health and survival.""

In the worst-affected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Central and Southern Asia, the regions with the greatest burden of newborn and maternal deaths, fewer than 60 per cent of women receive even four, of WHO's recommended eight, antenatal checks.

""The death of any woman or young girl during pregnancy or childbirth is a serious violation of their human rights,"" said Dr Julitta Onabanjo, Director of the Technical Division at the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).

""It also reflects the urgent need to scale-up access to quality sexual and reproductive health services as part of universal health coverage and primary health care, especially in communities where maternal mortality rates have stagnated or even risen during recent years. We must take a human rights and gender transformative approach to address maternal and newborn mortality, and it is vital that we stamp out the underlying factors which give rise to poor maternal health outcomes like socio-economic inequalities, discrimination, poverty, and injustice"".

Based on current trends, more than 60 countries are not set to meet the maternal, newborn, and stillborn mortality reduction targets in the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.",2023-05-09 13:49:38,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/disease/news/1-pregnant-woman-or-newborn-dies-every-7-seconds-who-3315381,2023-05-18 10:22:31,thedailystar

A team from the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control, and Research (IEDCR) has started visiting different parts of Chattogram to investigate into the cause of a diarrhoea outbreak.

There has been an outbreak of diarrheoa in several upazilas of Chattogram for a week. Four upazilas -- Patiya, Boalkhali, Anwara and Chandanaish -- are the worst affected, reports our local correspondent citing sources in Chattogram Civil Surgeon's office.

Although the diarrhoea outbreak has not yet spread widely, the Chattogram Civil Surgeon's office has taken several steps in advance.

Apart from issuing a set of instructions to all upazila health officers, a three-member committee was also formed by the Civil Surgeon office to look into the matter.

The Civil Surgeon of Chattogram Dr Ilias Chowdhury also wrote to the director of IEDCR on May 5 requesting him to take initiative to inquire into the cause.

On May 5, a total of 263 diarrhoea patients were admitted in 14 upazila health complexes in Chattogram district, said sources in Chattogram Civil Surgeon Office.

Of those, 49 patients were admitted to Patiya upazila health complex, 29 to Anwara upazila health complex, 34 to Chandanaish upazila health complex and 39 patients were admitted to Boalkhali upazila health complex.

A 12-member IEDCR team has reached Chattogram last evening to investigate into the case of diarrhoea outbreak.

Contacted, Civil Surgeon Dr Ilias Chowdhury said the team from IEDCR has started its work since this morning.

The team would visit the affected upazilas and would go to the home of patients to collect the samples of water they use for drinking, he said.

They will also collect information about their lifestyle.

During the field visit, the team will also talk to the doctors, nurses and healthcare givers in upazila health complexes and would also observe the treatment procedure, he said.

229,Covid Pandemic: WHO declares end to global emergency,"Covid-19 no longer represents a global health emergency, the World Health Organization said yesterday, a major step towards the end of the pandemic that has killed more than 6.9 million people, disrupted the global economy and ravaged communities.

The WHO's Emergency Committee met on Thursday and recommended the UN-agency declare an end to the public health emergency of international concern, which has been in place for over three years.

""It is therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, adding the end of the emergency did not mean Covid was over as a global health threat.

The WHO's emergency committee first declared that Covid represented its highest level of alert more than three years ago, on January 30 2020. The status helps focus international attention on a health threat, as well as bolstering collaboration on vaccines and treatments.

Lifting it is a sign of the progress the world has made in these areas, but Covid-19 is here to stay, the WHO has said, even if it no longer represents an emergency.

""Covid has changed the world, and it has changed us. And that's the way it should be. If we go back to how things were before Covid-19, we will have failed to learn our lessons, and failed our future generations,"" said Ghebreyesus.",2023-05-05 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/disease/who/news/covid-pandemic-who-declares-end-global-emergency-3312091,2023-05-18 10:22:34,thedailystar
230,16 more hospitalised with dengue,"At least 16 patients were hospitalised with dengue in the last 24 hours till yesterday morning.

With the new ones, the total number of dengue cases rose to 1,053 this year, according to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).

Some 74 dengue patients are still undergoing treatment in hospitals.

The total number of deaths in dengue was 281 last year while the total number of cases was 62,382, of which 23,162 were outside Dhaka, according to the DGHS.",2023-05-03 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/disease/news/16-more-hospitalised-dengue-3310706,2023-05-18 10:22:35,thedailystar
231,Bangladesh may witness worse dengue outbreak this year: experts,"Health experts have warned that the country may witness an even worse outbreak of Aedes mosquito-borne dengue this year as the presence of this virus-carrying insect has increased in the early days of summer.

The Directorate General of Health Services has issued a warning that those who previously had dengue and recovered will not be affected by the same type of dengue. However, there is a risk of death if affected by a different type of dengue.

Entomologist and Professor Dr Kabirul Bashar said dengue cases will increase from the current month in and outside Dhaka.

Moreover, due to the effects of climate change, Aedes larvae are now found in drain water, and Aedes mosquitoes are born all year round due to the accumulation of water in the car parking areas in the buildings in addition to the rain, he said.

Experts have advised all organisations, including city corporations, municipalities, and union parishads, to play a strong role in controlling Aedes mosquitoes from now.

According to the information provided by the DGHS, Aedes larvae were found in 39.37 percent of high-rise buildings in Dhaka, in 32.28 percent of under-construction buildings, in 14.1 percent of flower tubs and trays, in 18.1 percent of plastic containers, and on 12.1 percent of waterlogged floors.

Local Government and Rural Development Minister Tajul Islam has said he instructed the mayors of the two city corporations of Dhaka, Chittagong City Corporation to take all measures in advance to prevent mosquito-borne disease, prevent waterlogging, and make people aware.

""Mosquito extermination should be done throughout the year, and people must take necessary measures to prevent mosquito-borne diseases and eliminate waterlogging,"" he said.

The minister added that activities to prevent dengue will be conducted until December, and the mayors of Dhaka south and north city corporations have already collected the required amount of insecticides needed for the year.

The severity of dengue in Dhaka increased in 2000, with 5,500 people infected and 93 deaths. In 2019, dengue hit Bangladesh the hardest, with about 1.13 lakh people affected, and dengue spread in 64 districts of the country. In 2022, 62,321 people were infected with dengue, and 281 people died.

A World Bank (WB) study report released last year found a wider link between the shifting climatic conditions and the increase in dengue and some other diseases in Bangladesh.

It says with falling humidity levels, rising temperatures, and increasing rainfall caused by climate change, the risk of dengue spread can be higher in the country, mainly in Dhaka and Chattogram cities, in the future.

The report says Bangladesh experienced a 0.5°C increase in average temperature between 1976 and 2019 and is slowly losing the variations between seasons.

It also said summers are becoming hotter and longer while winters are warmer, and the monsoon seasons are being extended from February to October.

The report also predicted that average temperatures across Bangladesh will rise by 1.4°C by 2050 while annual rainfall is likely to increase by 74 millimetres by 2040-2059.",2023-05-03 14:55:15,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/disease/news/bangladesh-may-witness-worse-dengue-outbreak-year-experts-3310296,2023-05-18 10:22:36,thedailystar
232,Digitalisation can reduce heart diseases in country,"Says speakers as two-day Cardiovascular Conference ends

The digitalisation of the healthcare sector will help reduce the burden of heart diseases in the country, speakers said at the two-day international cardiovascular conference in Dhaka, which ended today.

With the slogan -- ""One Step Ahead into the World of Digital Science"", around 1,000 doctors from all over Bangladesh attended different scientific seminars at the event titled ""BANGLADESH LIVE 2023"".

The conference was organised by Interactive Professional Development Initiatives Foundation (IPDI).

Speaking as chief guest at the inaugural session on Monday, Speaker of the Parliament Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury thanked the IPDI Foundation for playing a significant role to train doctors in using state-of-the-art digital technology.

""Despite various constraints, Bangladesh has been able to make great progress in the healthcare sector. Private organisations are also joining this effort. Digitalisation in the healthcare sector will largely reduce the incidence of heart disease in the country,"" she said, according to a press release.

At the event, National Prof Brig (Rtd) Abdul Malik and Indian Prof Ashok Seth were awarded lifetime honours for their outstanding contributions to the field of cardiology.

In his welcome speech, Dr Mohsin Ahmed, secretary general of IPDI Foundation, highlighted their efforts to train doctors by conducting scientific research and organising seminars and conferences.

""In continuation of our efforts, we are holding this event with the slogan 'One Step Ahead into the World of Digital Science',"" he said.

Prof Abdul Wadud Chowdhury, president of IPDI said IPDI will continue their activities in future as well.

233,Know the physical symptoms of depression for better management,"Depression can affect not only your mental state but also your physical health.

Sleep problems: Individuals who are depressed may experience difficulty sleeping, either struggling to fall asleep or waking up frequently. On the other hand, some people may sleep excessively.

Chest pain: Chest pain should be evaluated by a doctor to rule out potential medical issues. However, it can also be a symptom of depression and may increase the risk of heart disease, particularly in those who have had heart attacks.

Fatigue and exhaustion: Fatigue and exhaustion are common symptoms of depression, making it difficult to perform everyday activities, even after resting or sleeping for long periods. Experiencing chronic pain increases the risk of depression, and conversely, depression can cause pain as the two conditions share chemical messengers in the brain.

Aching muscles and joints: Living with chronic pain can increase the likelihood of developing depression. This is because the experience of constant pain can be exhausting and limit one's ability to carry out daily activities.

Additionally, depression and pain share chemical messengers in the brain, which can exacerbate both conditions. People who are depressed are three times more likely to experience regular pain, further highlighting the link between the two conditions. It is essential to seek professional help to manage both pain and depression to improve overall well-being.

Digestive problems: The brain and digestive system are closely linked, which means that stress and anxiety can lead to physical symptoms such as stomach-aches or nausea. Similarly, depression can also impact the gut, causing symptoms such as indigestion, diarrhoea, constipation, or nausea.

Headaches: Research indicates that there is a strong link between major depression and migraines. In fact, one study found that individuals with major depression are three times more likely to experience migraines, while those with migraines are five times more likely to develop depression. The exact nature of this relationship is not yet fully understood, but it is thought that the two conditions may share similar underlying biological mechanisms.

Changes in appetite or weight: Depression can have a significant impact on appetite and eating behaviours. Some individuals may experience a loss of appetite and have little interest in food, while others may find themselves overeating and struggling to control their intake. These fluctuations in eating habits can result in weight gain or weight loss, which can further contribute to feelings of low energy and self-esteem.

Depression has also been linked to the development of eating disorders, such as bulimia, anorexia, or binge eating disorder. These conditions involve problematic relationships with food and can have serious physical and mental health consequences. It is essential to seek professional help to manage both depression and eating disorders to improve overall health and well-being.

Back pain: Chronic pain can lead to depression, while depression can increase the likelihood of intense, disabling neck or back pain by four times.

Agitated and restless: Sleep issues and other depression symptoms can lead to irritability. Depression-related irritability is more common in men than in women.

Sexual problems: Depression can decrease your sex drive, and certain antidepressant medications can also affect sexual desire and performance. It is important to discuss medication options with your doctor if you experience these side effects.

Regular physical activity can release brain chemicals that improve mood and reduce pain sensitivity. While not a cure, it can help ease depression over time, alleviate fatigue, and improve sleep. Despite feeling low on energy, trying to incorporate exercise into your routine can be beneficial.",2023-05-06 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-health/news/know-the-physical-symptoms-depression-better-management-3313101,2023-05-18 10:22:38,thedailystar
234,A kind road to happiness,"If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap. If you want happiness for a day, go fishing. If you want happiness for a month, get married. If you want happiness for a year, inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime, help somebody else.

Good deeds with kindness can build a compassionate society and, thus, a happy world. Today, 'kindness' is considered a fundamental part of human existence. In addition to technological advancement and economic enrichment, the value of kindness for happiness has not changed since Epicurus's time. Interestingly unlike kindness, happiness has a different meaning to each of us, filtered and defined through the course of each of our lives.

By definition, happiness is 'an inner state or harmony, feeling or attitude'. But, this can mean different things in different cultures. Danes often describe inner harmony in terms of 'HYGGE', which is something like coziness and comfortable pleasantness. They are often said to be the happiest country after Finland and Iceland.

So far, Nordic countries along with a couple of European and North American countries ranked in the top ten (World Happiness Report), well ahead of any Asian, African, or Australasian countries. But, measuring happiness precisely is as difficult as catching a selective butterfly. In large countries like India or the USA, even comparing people within the same borders can be difficult.

The United States is home to significant regional differences in personality characteristics. Southern Europeans tend to display more 'attachment anxiety', while the western regions breed more' attachment avoidance'. Bhutanese people believe in 'karma' and that if they live a good life, and do good things, they would be better reincarnated in other lives. This faith prompts them to be kind-hearted people who do good deeds for each other. Bhutan is the first country in the world that has introduced a 'Gross National Happiness.' It measures people's quality of life, and makes sure that ""material and spiritual development happen together"". It has one of the fastest-growing GDPs in the world at the same time as maintaining its environment and its cultural identity.

235,Childhood adversity is linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes as young adults,"According to a recently published article in Diabetologia, the official journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), there is a higher likelihood for individuals who have undergone childhood adversity to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) at a young age.

Adversity experienced during childhood, which can encompass events like maltreatment, illness in the family, and living in poverty, has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) in early adulthood. Such experiences can trigger physiological stress responses that affect the nervous system, hormones, and immune system.

Additionally, they can impact mental well-being and lead to unhealthy behaviours, including poor sleep, smoking, reduced physical activity, sedentary behaviour, increased alcohol consumption, and unhealthy eating habits. These behaviours can result in obesity and a higher risk of developing T2D. This was found by researchers at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.

The study included children born in Denmark since 1980 and followed them from age 16 onwards. Out of 1.2 million participants, 2,560 women and 2,300 men developed type 2 diabetes during the study's follow-up period, which lasted an average of 10.8 years.

The authors found that the relative risks of developing type 2 diabetes following childhood adversity were lower among women than men across all groups. The study reveals that early interventions targeting the fundamental causes of childhood adversity, such as poverty and illness, could prevent some cases of type 2 diabetes in young adulthood.

The researchers also note that there is a close relationship between parental education levels and children's experience of adversity, which explains some of the observed association. The study is strengthened by its large size and freedom from selection or recall bias.

The researchers concluded that identifying and addressing the risk factors for type 2 diabetes in early adulthood is crucial to public health, especially given the aggressive pathology of early-onset type 2 diabetes and the increased risk of complications.

The researchers suggest that early interventions targeting the root causes of childhood adversity could prevent or reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in young adulthood. By addressing the negative impact of adversity on children's lives, a portion of the T2D cases that arise in early adulthood may be preventable.",2023-05-06 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-health/news/childhood-adversity-linked-increased-risk-developing-type-2-diabetes-young-adults-3313091,2023-05-18 10:22:41,thedailystar
236,Adverse pregnancy outcomes are associated with increased prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis,"A recent study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) has found that women with a history of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular events.

The study, which analysed a population-based cohort of 10,528 women aged 50 to 65 in Sweden, found that 18.9% of women had a history of APO, with preterm delivery being the most common (9.5%) and gestational diabetes being the least common (1.4%).

The study revealed that women with a history of APO had a significantly higher prevalence of any coronary atherosclerosis than those without APO (32% vs. 28%). Preeclampsia and gestational hypertension were found to have the highest prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) among women with APO.

The association between APOs and CAD was found to hold true even among women with low 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease based on conventional risk factors. The authors of the study emphasised the importance of early and intensive risk-factor management in patients with a history of APO, as these data highlight the increased risk of CAD in these women.

According to the accompanying editorial, the independent risk of CAD following a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is likely directly related to the effects of the disorder. However, individuals with a history of other APOs, such as gestational diabetes, are likely at increased risk due to conventional risk factors.",2023-05-06 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-health/news/adverse-pregnancy-outcomes-are-associated-increased-prevalence-coronary-atherosclerosis-3313086,2023-05-18 10:22:42,thedailystar
237,TCB hikes sugar price,"It’ll sell for Tk 70 a kg from today

State-owned Trading Corporation of Bangladesh will start selling sugar from today to the family card holders for Tk 70 a kg, a rise by 16 percent or Tk 10 from the previous price.

The price hike comes less than a week after the government gave the private refiners the nod to hike prices of the sweetener by 15 percent or Tk 16 per kg at the retail level.

The TCB in a press release yesterday said it will sell three commodities -- sugar, lentil and bottled soybean oil -- to one crore family card holders for the month of May. The state agency, however, has kept the prices of the two other essentials unchanged.

Each card holder would be able to buy a maximum one kg of sugar at Tk 70, two kgs of lentil at Tk 70 per kg and two litres of soybean oil at Tk 110 per litre.

Holders of family cards can buy the essentials either from a dealer's shop or from a spot, said the agency that sells the commodities among low-income families at subsidised prices.",2023-05-13 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/food/price-essentials/news/tcb-hikes-sugar-price-3319081,2023-05-18 10:22:43,thedailystar

Sugar prices recently reached a record high, going for as much as Tk 142 per kg at retail. Considering the needs of low-income people, the government is set to import 12,500 tonnes of the sweetener for sale at subsidised rates. The photo was taken from a shop in Khulna city last night.

The government on Monday approved the refiners' proposal for rising the retail price of sugar by Tk 16 a kg in accordance with the price hike in the international market.

From now on, loose sugar will be Tk 120 a kg, according to a circular of the commerce ministry.

The price of packaged sugar has been hiked to Tk 125 a kg from Tk 109 a kg.

After the refiners made the proposal, Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission analysed sugar prices in the international market and the import cost.

For months, sugar price in the local market has been higher than the price fixed by the government on Monday.

The sweetener was selling for Tk 130-Tk 140 a kg at retail yesterday, according to price data compiled by the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.

The commerce ministry is going to ask the National Board of Revenue to keep the reduced duty on raw sugar imports, Senior Commerce Secretary Tapan Kanti Ghosh said yesterday.

The reduced duty facility is to expire on May 31, he told journalists at his secretariat office after a meeting with refiners and stakeholders.

However, the secretary did not mention when the ministry would ask the NBR.

Ghulam Rahman, president of Consumers Association of Bangladesh, said if sugar price increases in the international market, then the price will go up in the local market. It is normal.

He said the government should not be setting the price. If there is competition in the market, the price of goods will be reasonable. If there is no competition, it is not possible to control the price by fixing it, he said.

The CAB boss said there is no competition in the sugar market. Some refiners control the market.

Some 258 million people needed emergency food aid last year because of conflict, economic shocks and climate disasters, a UN report said Wednesday, a sharp rise from 193 million the previous year.

""More than a quarter of a billion people are now facing acute levels of hunger, and some are on the brink of starvation. That's unconscionable,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.

It was ""a stinging indictment of humanity's failure to make progress... to end hunger, and achieve food security and improved nutrition for all,"" he said.

More than 40 percent of those in serious need of food lived in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Yemen, the UN report said.

""Conflicts and mass displacement continue to drive global hunger,"" Guterres said.

""Rising poverty, deepening inequalities, rampant underdevelopment, the climate crisis and natural disasters also contribute to food insecurity.""

In 2022, 258 million people faced high levels of acute food insecurity in 58 countries or territories, up from 193 million in 53 countries the previous year, the report said.

A kg of sugar was being sold for Tk 140-142 yesterday.

Traders claimed that importers and dealers increased the price, reduced the supply and gave the ""excuse of high prices in the international market"".

They said most of the sugar now in the local market was bought one and a half months ago when the price was less.

According to the International Sugar Organisation (ISO), raw sugar price in the international market has increased 6 percent in a month.

Eight dengue patients died, while 765 were admitted to hospitals across the country yesterday.

These are the highest single-day numbers recorded this year.

Total dengue cases crossed the 23,000 mark, the third-highest number witnessed since the first outbreak in Bangladesh in 2000.

A total of 1,01,354 dengue cases, the highest, were recorded in 2019, and 28,429 in 2021. The death tolls were 179 and 105, respectively.

According to the Directorate General of Health Services, 23,282 dengue patients, 5,205 from outside Dhaka, have been hospitalised across the country this year so far.

This year's death toll has now risen to 83. Of the deceased, 28 died in the first 13 days of October alone.

Experts urged authorities to immediately conduct extensive drives to identify clusters of Aedes mosquitoes.

Yesterday at a press briefing in the capital's Mohakhali, Prof Ahmedul Kabir, additional director general (administration) of DGHS, said the highest number of dengue cases have been witnessed in Cox's Bazar, during the current season.

The number of deaths is high outside Dhaka. Most of them died three days after hospitalisation, he said.

DGHS has instructed authorities to prepare more hospitals for dengue treatment.

Entomologist Prof Kabirul Bashar of Jahangirnagar University said every year in October, dengue cases start going down. But this time, the numbers will keep rising.

It is not possible to control dengue without managing mosquito hotspots. This year, authorities took inadequate measures to find and manage these sites, said Kabirul.

""Hotspot management means identifying risky houses and areas by collecting addresses of dengue patients,"" he explained. Authorities will have to kill adult Aedes mosquitoes and their larvae at these sites, and build awareness among residents.

Entomologist GM Saifur Rahman of Bangladesh National University said as short-term activities, authorities will have to conduct surveys in risky areas to find dengue patients who show mild symptoms and bring them under care.

They will also have to conduct intensive control operations in those areas to kill mosquitoes and build public awareness. The public should also take personal measures to protect themselves by using mosquito repellent and wearing clothes that cover arms, he said.

Last month, Dhaka North City Corporation Chief Health Officer Brig Gen Md Zobaidur Rahman said apart from regular and special drives, they have purchased 30 boats to clean waterbodies and use insecticides properly.

Md Abu Nasher, public relations officer of Dhaka South City Corporation, said besides routine drives, they are taking different measures to control Aedes mosquitoes, including drives around houses of dengue patients.",2022-10-13 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/health-alert/news/dengue-claims-8-lives-day-3142191,2023-05-18 10:22:55,thedailystar
247,‘Pink eye’ prevalence in the port city,"Mostly children, their parents getting infected

There has been a sudden increase in conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva of the eye) patients in Chattogram city for over two weeks.

Children are seen to be infected mostly in the disease, popularly known as pink eye, making the guardians concerned.

Many are afraid of sending their children to school lest they should get infected by their classmates.

The infected are mostly receiving treatment at home, said sources.

According to Chattogram Medical College Hospital (CMCH), around 100 patients with conjunctivitis are coming to the outpatient department of the hospital each day for the last couple of weeks. The number of patients was around two to three just a month ago.

According to ophthalmologists, conjunctivitis or pink eye is a medical condition when an inflammation or infection takes place in transparent membrane (conjunctiva) of the eye.

Doctors said the sudden increase is due to a viral infection. However, the good news is that most patients are being recovered within a week, they added.

Md Islmail, a resident of Sholashahar, said his daughter got infected with pink eye last week, and after two days, he himself had conjunctivitis.

Ismail said both of them got recovered in five days, after receiving primary treatment at home.

Palash Majumder, another guardian, echoed the same.

Debugging an age old myth surrounding pink-eye, Prof Dr SM Tareq, former head of ophthalmology at CMCH, said, ""Although the disease is highly contagious, just looking at someone's eyes does not contaminate the disease.""

""Only direct contact with the infected eye can spread the disease,"" he said.

Dr Tareq said sometimes antibiotic drops are required for the treatment of patients to prevent them from secondary infection. Most patients get cured by primary treatment in house, he said.

Echoing the same, Dr Delwar Hossain, a consultant of ophthalmology at Chevron Eye Hospital Chattogram, said, ""Every year this viral infectious disease is seen during summer but this time its has increased in autumn.""",2022-09-22 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/health-alert/news/pink-eye-prevalence-the-port-city-3125881,2023-05-18 10:22:56,thedailystar
248,The dangerous rise of dengue,"Twenty-four dengue patients have died so far in the country, of whom, 21 died in the last eight months.

The number of dengue cases was 6,257 till September 22, which is half the total number of infections this year, according to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).

Among the deaths, 18 occurred in Cox's Bazar, four in Barishal, three in Chattogram and 21 in Dhaka.

Experts urged the authorities concerned to take immediate measures against the spread of the disease and identify and neutralise clusters of Aedes mosquitoes.

A monsoon survey of the DGHS, conducted between August 11 and 23, found the presence of Aedes mosquitoes in 13.4 percent of houses under Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and 11.75 percent of homes under Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC).

Safwan was admitted to Mugda General Hospital with dengue around five days ago, with a very low platelet count. Yesterday, the five-year-old was seen enjoying some screentime, taking a break from playing with toys after his situation saw improvement. More and more dengue patients are requiring hospitalisation as the number of cases continues to rise across the country. At least 431 patients were admitted to different hospitals yesterday. Photo: Palash Khan

For the survey, a total of 1,319 households of 40 DNCC wards and 1,830 households of 58 DSCC wards were surveyed. It also found 13 wards under DNCC and 14 wards in DSCC to be highly risk-prone as the density of Aedes mosquitoes was found to be higher in those wards.

Entomologist Manzur A Chowdhury said dengue has already turned into an epidemic.

""It is claimed that Bangladesh is still in better condition compared to other countries when it comes to the dengue situation. But the reality is that many of our dengue cases remain unrecorded. In other countries, every single case is counted in the data,"" he added.

Stressing the need for identifying the clusters, Manzur said the authorities will have to collect the addresses of dengue patients for identification purposes.

""They will also have to take effective measures within a 500-yard radius of the homes. This measure, called hotspot management, will be crucial in raising awareness,"" added Manzur.

Dr Md Ekramul Haque, deputy programme manager of malaria and ATD control programme at DGHS, said they have already sent dengue diagnosing kits to upazilas and asked all the hospital authorities to arrange separate wards for dengue patients if necessary.

He said the number of dengue cases this year is high in September due to the late rain.

""Many hospitals have already arranged for separate dengue wards. We have also directed the hospital authorities at district levels and in Dhaka to arrange for separate wards where the number of dengue patients is high,"" said Ekramul.

He also informed that they are going to conduct immediate advocacy programmes in this regard in 10 areas of the two city corporations.

Last month, DNCC Chief Health Officer Brig Gen Md Zobaidur Rahman said apart from their regular and special drives, they have purchased 30 boats to clean waterbodies and use insecticides properly.

The authorities have also introduced a ""bell system"", where mosquito-control workers use bells while spraying larvicide to improve monitoring and inform residents about the activities, he explained.

Md Abu Nasher, DSCC public relations officer, said apart from their routine anti-mosquito drives, they are taking different measures to control Aedes mosquitoes, including drives around houses of dengue patients.",2022-09-21 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/health-alert/news/the-dangerous-rise-dengue-3125116,2023-05-18 10:22:57,thedailystar
249,"Dengue cases double between July, Aug","August witnessed 3,551 dengue cases, more than double the number recorded in July. This indicates that the dengue situation is further deteriorating.

The number of deaths also rose to 21 till date. Ten people died in August alone. In July, 1,571 dengue cases were recorded.

Experts urged city corporations to take immediate steps to tackle the issue. Otherwise, people, especially Dhaka residents, will be at further risk of contracting dengue in the coming days.

According to data of Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), at least one dengue patient died, while 251 were admitted to different hospitals across the country in the last 24 hours till 8:00am yesterday.

The monsoon survey of DGHS shows a grim picture. Dhaka residents may witness a bigger wave of dengue in the coming days, as the population of Aedes mosquitoes in monsoon is over double that of the previous season.

""Authorities will have to find clusters of Aedes mosquito-prone areas by collecting addresses of dengue patients. Then, they will have to take effective measures within a 500-yard radius of the homes.

This measure, called hotspot management, will also raise awareness in the areas,"" said entomologist Monzur A Chowdhury.

250,Still no robust policy to control Aedes mosquitoes,"This year’s dengue cases cross 5,000 mark

Three years have passed since the country witnessed over one lakh dengue patients in a year.

However, even after that crisis, the initiative taken to prepare a policy to control vectors like Aedes mosquitoes is still in the drafting process.

Such initiatives have now become a dire necessity, as dengue cases crossed the 5,000 mark yesterday.

Aedes mosquitoes are vectors of dengue and Chikungunya viruses. Experts said as dengue has become endemic in the country and has already spread at the district level, a comprehensive policy or separate vector-control cell is crucial.

According to Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), 5,117 patients were admitted to different hospitals till yesterday. This year's death toll is 19 so far.

Local Government and Rural Development Minister Md Tazul Islam said the situation in Bangladesh is still better than in other tropical countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam.

He said they are still working on forming a comprehensive policy. A team from Australia experienced in vector management has shown interest to help in this regard.

Local Government Division Additional Secretary Mustakim Billah Faruqui said they are working to finalise the initiative taken in 2020.

Authorities are now seeking opinions from DGHS, experts and different city corporations to form a cell, he said.

Entomologist of Jahangirnagar University Prof Kabirul Bashar said he first proposed a vector-control cell to the government in 2019 and gave an outline.

A committee was formed in this regard at that time, but the cell is yet to be formed, he said.

Bashar said such a cell is essential, as dengue has already spread across different cities and even districts.

""This year, Cox's Bazar became a hotspot for dengue. Ten dengue patients have already died there. But there is no institution or agency to control Aedes mosquitoes,"" he said.

Researching mosquito-borne diseases on the national level are crucial, he said. A separate institution is needed for this, he added.

This institution will also provide different city corporations guidelines on proper insecticide use, he said. It will also purchase suitable insecticides.

""City corporations and municipalities will be the implementing agencies, but the institution will be the central organisation,"" he added.

Echoing Bashar, entomologist GM Saifur Rahman of Bangladesh National University said the district authorities do not know how to control mosquito-borne diseases.

So, if there were a comprehensive policy, the officials would have a guideline to take proper steps, said Saifur.

""Research, surveillance and training at the district level are very important. Finding out which serotype of Aedes virus is prevalent is also essential,"" he said.

By identifying the serotype, it is possible to say whether the country will face a dengue epidemic. Authorities will then be able to take necessary steps, he added.",2022-08-25 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/health-alert/news/still-no-robust-policy-control-aedes-mosquitoes-3103431,2023-05-18 10:23:00,thedailystar

253,Fashion designer Chandana Dewan: The patchwork angel,"The story of how Chandana Dewan got into the world of fashion and how patchworks became her signature.

Chandana Dewan's fashion-forward ideas have been garnering much attention for quite some time. The designer is known to work with bold and vibrant colours as well as block motifs, but it is her love affair with patchwork that really sets her work apart from everyone else.

""I took a course on jewellery design in California and started dabbling with different mediums like paper and beads. My love for accessorising slowly started to spread across mediums and I started designing saris with patches decorated with embroidery"", explained Chandana.

She slowly started to expand her horizons and range of products, designing shalwar suits, kurtis, tops, shawls, bags and jewellery, men's kurta, and even children's outfits. Her creations gained a lot of traction and quickly became a go-to amongst fashionistas.

Photo: Sazzad Ibne Sayed

Chandana mostly works with bright colours and her work draws inspiration from nature and the changing seasons.

""My pieces are an embodiment of the season they correspond to. I also draw a lot of inspiration from deshi flowers like krishnachura, jaba, nayantara, rajanigandha, and even seasonal fruits for the motifs that go into my collection,"" she elaborated. However, her intricate patchworks have become her trademark over the years. The idea of patchwork actually came when she realised that a lot of fabric would be left over after making any outfit.

""A lot of good leftover fabric goes to waste because there is not enough to be utilised in making another outfit. However, I realised that these fabrics, when used as patches, can make any outfit even more eye-catching. I started experimenting with patchwork and soon, it became my signature style,"" she added.

Another defining element of Chandana's creations is the use of sustainable fabric. ""Light, comfortable, and easy to wear while being extremely stylish. Sustainable fabrics give the wearer a look that is timeless and distinct, and definitely a class apart. The climate of Bangladesh is very hot and humid. Keeping this in mind, we always try to use natural breathable fabrics with the emphasis being comfort,"" she further stated.

Chandana is currently working on new designs that will continue to implement her signature and trademark patches. She has also added embroidery, block print, and screen print to bring variations and break away from her usual style and keep things fresh. She will continue to experiment with the fabric of the patchwork and embellish her patches with beadwork, block print, and screen print and will continue to use bold vibrant palettes.

Photo: Sazzad Ibne Sayed

Chandana also had heaps of praise for the current fashion scene where women, regardless of age, ethnicity, or social position are trying to embrace fashion in their own way.

""Fashion now has become more affordable for the masses. Women wear colours based on seasonal variations and adopt the theme of the different festivities. They are very into the fusion Indo-Western look which is very popular now. This is a great time to be a fashion designer as we have the freedom to experiment with colours and trends and find designs that sit well among our clientele,"" she added in her concluding notes.

254,"""Tale of Blue River”: A love letter to Bangladesh’s rivers","Featuring saris, jumpsuits, jackets, dresses, and more, ""Tale of Blue River"" collection showcases the use of sustainable and eco-friendly materials and techniques, including the nakshi kantha stitch and natural indigo dye.

Afsana Ferdousi, the Bangladeshi fashion designer renowned for incorporating sustainability while fusing modernity and tradition in her designs, has come forward with her new collection. Titled ""Tale of Blue River,"" it is an ode to the riverine majesty of Bangladesh and a wake-up call for our society to work towards preserving and protecting these vital natural resources. Star Lifestyle recently spoke with her to discuss her creativity, and the thought process behind her designs and her latest collection.

Tale of Blue River

The collection features an array of saris, jumpsuits, jackets, midi dresses for women and shirts, shorts, and trousers for men. All the garments were created using silk, endi silk, handloom cotton, and linen.

One of the standout features of the collection is the use of sustainable, eco-friendly, and natural indigo dye to impart the various shades of blue. These shades reflect the hues of the river as it meets the sky at the horizon.

The pieces have been adorned with motifs of fishes, birds, boats, water lilies, flowing water, and the riverbed. These motifs are brought to life with the pride of our local heritage, and a signature of Afsana's design aesthetic, the Nakshi Kantha stitch. Almost 90 per cent of the embroidery of these motifs comprises Nakshi Kantha stitch done by hand, while the remaining 10 per cent of the stitches consist of satin stitch, chain stitch, and running stitch.

Inspiration behind the collection

Afsana wanted to pay homage to the rivers she grew up next to. To bring her inspiration to life, she researched the history and cultural significance of rivers. As part of her design process, after researching the concept, she then went on to sketch looks and create mood boards for the collection. She ensured that her team brought in their perspectives and expertise in the process. Together, they chose materials and experimented with various techniques to ensure that the resulting collection is wearable, comfortable, and sustainable, and maintains a unique aesthetic and message throughout.

""I worked with my team to translate my ideas into designs that capture the movement, texture, and colours of the river. I drew upon the imagery of flowing water, riverbeds, and aquatic life, and translated these into intricate Nakshi Katha stitches,"" said Afsana.

Message of the collection

Afsana has once again shown that fashion is an art and a form of storytelling. This collection is her homage to the 700 rivers of our motherland, our heritage, history, and culture. Each piece of the collection is a story in motion, a story of aquatic life and its connection to humanity and our Bengali identity.

She wanted to instil and inspire a deep respect and appreciation for the artistry and skills of our local craftsmen and artisans. The indigo dye and the Nakshi Kantha embroidery serve as a testament to the rich diversity and beauty of the heritage of Bangladeshi textiles. Each of the Nakshi Kantha stitches is a tribute to the beauty and vitality of our rivers. Moreover, the natural indigo dye also serves to remind us of the importance of environmentally conscious and eco-friendly practices in an industry known for its pollution and heavy waste.

""We hope that by wearing these pieces, people will be reminded of the importance of preserving Bangladesh's rivers and natural resources,"" stated Afsana.

The ""Tale of Blue River"" collection strives to forge a connection between local consumers and their surrounding natural environment, with pride, respect, and admiration.

To see the best of what the Maldives has to offer, you should begin in Malé, the capital. Malé is a must-see destination due to its rich history, vibrant architecture, azure seas, and swaying palm trees. It is bordered by historic structures on one side and varying colours of blue and green on the other. There are a lot of fascinating things to do in Malé, such as taking a walk through the streets that are bursting with colourful markets or learning about the history of the Maldives at the National Museum.

The beaches of the Maldives are some of the most stunning in the world, and Vaadhoo Island is home to a particularly breath-taking natural occurrence — sparkling blue water. The dazzling ""Sea of Stars"" is a natural phenomenon that contributes to this celestial scenery. Phytoplankton in the ocean produces bioluminescence, which causes this effect. The brilliant blue-neon hue that emanates from the breaking waves is most striking at night and such an event occurs very rarely. You can expect its recurrence from late summer until the end of the year, although it is not fixed. As with every natural occurrence, a little bit of luck is necessary to fully appreciate this magnificent shining event!

Ithaa Undersea Restaurant

In the native language of Dhivehi, ""Ithaa"" means ""mother of pearl,"" which is an apt description of the stunning scenery here. The Hilton Maldives Resort & Spa's restaurant is a small, intimate spot with seating for just 14, situated five meters below the ocean's surface. The ceiling is slanted like a tunnel, giving visitors a panoramic view of the coral reef that surrounds them. To get there, you will need to book a flight on a seaplane departing from Malé International Airport. They provide a unique blend of Western and Asian flavours in their modern fusion cuisine. Although the restaurant's prices are above average, the serving sizes are fair, and hotel guests may enjoy lunch starting at $120.

Whale Submarine

Taking a 45-minute submarine tour is one of the most enjoyable activities in the Maldives that your whole family can enjoy. Whale Submarine, a popular tourist destination in the Maldives, is an unforgettable adventure. It is a thrilling introduction to the diverse aquatic inhabitants of this island country and is sure to leave a lasting impression. You may see marine life such as yellow boxfish, blue snapper, lionfish, turtles, and shark rays during your journey. If you do not want to dive, this is among the greatest things to do in the Maldives!

Grand Friday Mosque

One of the world's largest mosques, the Grand Friday Mosque, can accommodate up to 5,000 people. The mosque attracts many visitors and pilgrims each year due to its exquisite marble exterior and enormous gold dome, both of which are much more breath-taking in person. As a component of Malé 's Islamic centre, this mosque is conveniently positioned close to the city's main pier, making it visible from the water. You are welcome to visit any time between 9AM and 5PM. However, you should try to avoid going during prayer times so as not to disrupt the congregation of worshippers.

Banana Reef

Banana reef, so-called because of its form when seen from above, is located to the north along the Malé island. This is, without a doubt, the most well-known diving spot in the whole Maldives, perhaps even worldwide. Beautiful reefs and corals of all different colours thrive there, along with a rich marine ecosystem and several cliffs and caves. If you are looking for a thrilling underwater journey, this is the finest place for you. Banana Reef is also a great place to dive because it is frequented by reef sharks and barracuda!

Fulhadhoo Island

Fulhadhoo Island is a popular tourist destination in the Maldives due to its crystal-clear lagoons, white-sand beaches, overhanging palm trees, and tranquil atmosphere. The riches on this unspoiled island are likely to remain undiscovered for as long as it remains one of the world's most remote and uninhabited islands. Snorkelling, scuba diving, and keeping an eye out for dolphins and turtles are all great ways to make the most of your stay here!",2023-05-10 11:46:13,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/travel/news/7-must-visit-places-your-maldives-vacation-3316236,2023-05-18 10:23:12,thedailystar
261,Travelling with the mother and the family,"Once upon a time, there was a young girl who loved to travel. That girl was me. My mother used to work for British Airways, a little detail I was very proud of because it meant we got free tickets.

I remember the first time I encountered London. It was after a long flight from Dhaka which was overbooked. Somehow, my mother's gift of the gab got us on the flight — seated in aeroplane crew seats (shocking what they let you get away with in the '90s!). While my four-or-five-year-old self was delighted, I am sure my own mother was tired and stressed out from travelling with a child.

Back in London, that trip was the first time I remember seeing snow. My mother's friend met us at the airport and took us back to her tiny flat in London. Being used to the independent houses in Dhaka in the late '80s and early '90s, I was stunned that someone could live in a place that small. I named it the Dollhouse. The whole time my mum, of course, had to manage all the logistical work of travelling and managing me.

What I have not mentioned yet, is that my mother was a single mum. We used to travel every year, sometimes, several times a year until my mother married my stepfather, and after that the three of us would travel together.

But, I am also sure it was not as easy as I thought it was for my mum to travel with me. I remember throwing up on the plane, not once, but several times. I also remember one time that I was very sick and had a terrible cough. My mother and I were flying into JFK and she was very worried that they might deport us. So, she gave me a higher dose of my cough medicine, which I am sure she regretted later. After we landed at the airport, I was so groggy and disoriented, I could not recognise my mother and threw a tantrum.

Despite some of these hiccups, the travels with my mother as well as the following family holidays later on were some of the most formative memories of my life.

The young girl who used to love travelling with her parents has now grown up and now she has children of her own. Travelling with them and as a family is truly something I cherish. I must add, though, travelling with the children is not really a ""holiday"" by any means.

The first time my husband and I travelled together with my stepdaughter, she got sick and had to be taken to the hospital in Thailand. The kind nurses were trying to help her unclog her stuffy nose by doing a sinus wash and in her indignance, my stepdaughter threw up on all of them. Cleaning up all kinds of messes comes with the territory of travelling with kids. It's basically karma for all the times we puked on our parents on holiday.

On that trip, I learnt how to manage a stroller for the first time. My husband always reminds me of how I almost dropped the stroller (and my stepdaughter in it!) while manoeuvring it on the escalator. That same trip, I also learnt how delightful children are as travel mates, with their curiosity and sense of fun. That trip allowed my stepdaughter and I to bond in a new way, and cement our relationship with each other.

Photo: Collected

By the time my son was born and the first time we travelled with both children, just before the COVID-19 lockdown, I was already pretty experienced at travelling with a child but not with a baby. As a true millennial mum, I dutifully googled and made checklists and made sure I had everything but the kitchen sink. I was anxious about being that parent that gets dirty looks from all the passengers because their baby is crying.

My son was breastfeeding at the time and since babies usually cry because of ear pressure, to help them, you just need to give them something to suck on or drink. Bundled up in my BabyBjorn and makeshift nursing shawl, I breastfed and he truly 'slept like a baby.' I was also prepared with pacifiers which came in very handy.

Thankfully, even now, my son is an excellent traveller and usually sleeps on the plane or watches movies and is pretty flexible and easy-going. But, he is also extremely curious like most toddlers and manages to get himself into a lot of sticky situations.

Looking back, I cannot even imagine how I would manage him on my own at an airport. Whenever the four of us travel together, we divide up tasks — which includes making sure the little tot does not run away and we have a Home Alone situation on our hands.

For any new parents who are planning to travel with your baby, fret not. Google and checklists really are your best friends. Trust yourself, prepare and plan as much as you can but be willing to go with the flow. Expect messes to clean up, naps in the stroller and some of the best memories of you and your children's lives.",2023-05-08 08:30:58,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/travel/news/travelling-the-mother-and-the-family-3314226,2023-05-18 10:23:14,thedailystar

265,Mother’s Day cake recipe,"Being a new mom has been such an experience for me. The deeper I get into it, the more I sympathise and appreciate my own mother and our time together growing up. What I'm most in awe of is the vast amount of knowledge every mother needs to keep under her hat, from which is the best home remedy for reliving colds in babies, to which stores stock the right diapers, to how to make perfect plain cake to dip in your morning cha while the baby sleeps!

My mother loves cake. Regardless of how beautifully a cake has been made and the million frostings, techniques, and designs done she just prefers the cake part itself. She's simple and down-to-earth like that; just the opposite of extra. I love that about her.

But I also love a beautifully made cake. So here is my version of Ammu's plain cake with condensed milk buttercream, also known as Russian buttercream. The pairing is light and flavourful – a meeting point between Ammu and I.

PLAIN CAKE WITH CONDENSED MILK BUTTERCREAM

Ingredients

For the cake —

3 cups flour

1 teaspoon baking powder

¼ teaspoon salt

2¾ cups sugar, grind a bit before using

1¼ cups butter, softened

1 teaspoon vanilla essence

5 eggs

1 cup evaporated milk

For the buttercream —

250 g unsalted butter – softened at room temperature

200 g sweetened condensed milk

1 teaspoon vanilla essence

Method

For the cake —

Heat oven to 350°F. Grease and flour an 8"" cake pan. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and set aside.

In a large bowl, beat sugar, butter, vanilla essence, and eggs with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping the bowl constantly. Beat on high speed for 5 minutes, scraping the bowl occasionally. Beat in flour mixture alternately with milk on low speed. Pour into the pan – do not fill more than 2/3 of the pan.

Bake for 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean. Cool for 20 minutes. Remove from pan to wire rack. Cool completely, about 1 hour.

For the buttercream —

In a large bowl, using a stand mixer/hand mixer, beat the butter for 3-4 minutes until it's light and fluffy.

Add the vanilla extract and beat for a minute. Add the condensed milk to the butter and whip them together for about a minute. Do not beat too much else you will incorporate a lot of air in the final frosting.

Ensure your cakes/cupcakes are cool before you start piping.

To assemble —

Once cooled, place the cake on a table and slice 3 separate layers to get 3 round cake layers.

Place a cake layer on a cake board, soak it well with milk and a brush, and add a dollop of buttercream to fill. Place the second layer on top and fill again. After the third cake layer and frost all sides of the cake. This is called the crumb coat.

Refrigerate the cake for half an hour before adding more cream and smoothening out the sides. Use fresh or plastic flowers for décor. Use a stamp to imprint message on a piece of rolled-out fondant.

266,Eid Recipes: A classic twist on lachha shemai,"An Eid spread is incomplete without delectable desserts and shemai is sure to be on the table.

Raisins and nuts for garnish

For the sugar syrup —

1 cup water

½ cup sugar

A few strands of saffron

1 tsp lime juice

Method

Add softened butter or ghee to a pack of lachha shemai and combine well using your fingertips. Once all the butter is incorporated, drop in orange food colour and combine again, and set it aside. In a bowl, crumble mawa or ricotta cheese (whichever is available to you) and add in sterilised cream along with sugar and mix everything together to get a smooth paste.

To assemble, in a greased springform pan, place half of the vermicelli mixture. Pat the top hard using your fingertips to pack the mixture. Then, pour the cheese and cream mixture on top and spread evenly. Next, top with shredded mozzarella cheese. Finally, add the remaining vermicelli mixture on top and pat, ensuring it is tightly packed.

Let this bake in a preheated oven at 170°C for 25-30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the sugar syrup. In a pan, add water and sugar and stir, wait for it to come to a simmer. Once it is simmering, drop in a few strands of saffron and let it boil. Once it is thick and attained a strong consistency, turn off the heat and drop in a few drops of lime juice.

Cut the whole large nori sheets into four. Brush hands with oil, then in the nori sheets, place in 1 tablespoon of the cooked rice in the middle of the sheet. Then using your hands, place the rice properly spreading it through the corners, but leave gaps in the corners.

Take your muffin mould, brush oil in it. Then, press the nori with rice in them into the mould — they will look like flowers. After that, place in one tbsp of the prawn cheese mix into the rice cups. Bake in pre-heated oven for 18-20 mins at 175° C. Serve topping with spicy mayo/kewpie mayo, and soy sauce dip mixed with wasabi.

STREET STYLE THAI BASIL CHICKEN

Ingredients

½ chicken breast (around 200g)

5 cloves of garlic, if you like it garlicy

Red chilli, as per preference

3 tsp soy sauce, light

1½ tsp oyster sauce

1½ tsp sugar (better if adjusted as per taste)

1 tsp soy sauce (dark)

Oil

Thai basil, as per taste (Fresh mint leaves can also be used, but it will not be basil chicken by name. However, it will not differ much in terms of flavour or taste. Just make sure the mint is fresh)

Method

Cut your chicken into bite-sized pieces. Roughly crush together garlic and red chillies.

In a hot pan, add oil. Now, add the crushed garlic and chilli. This is my favourite part of the cooking, for the aroma it sets around. Stir fry that for just about a few seconds until flavours come out, and add in your chicken.

Fry the chicken for about a minute or so, and then pour in your light soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and finally, the dark soy sauce. The reason for using both soy sauces is because of the depth of flavours they add individually and also to hit intricacy right!

Stir it all, and cook for about a few minutes. Right during the end, add in your basil, and give it just one stir and get off heat, because we do not want to overcook the leaves.

I highly recommend the dish with steamed rice, and oozing yolky fried egg; the yolk gives a silky texture to rice.

CRISPY FISH TACO WITH PICKLED CARROTS

Ingredients

1 fillet dory fish

1 tsp soy sauce

2 tsp oyster sauce

½ tsp pepper

1 tsp lemon juice

A pinch oregano

Tempura (A classic regular tempura batter made with ice-cold water for crispiness)

Flour, for regular tortilla

2 tbsp mayo

5-7 mint leaves, crushed

½ tsp lemon juice

½ carrot

½ cup vinegar

Method

First, slice the carrots using a peeler for a finer finish. Leave them to be pickled by taking in small glass bowl, and drenching in vinegar, a pinch of ground black pepper. Rest for at least 25 minutes.

Prep the fish by cleaning and cutting. Marinate using soy sauce, oyster sauce, pepper, lemon juice, and leave for 15 minutes. Make the tempura batter with ice cold water. Now, on the side make the tortilla with flour, water, and salt (regular taco tortilla). Once done toasting the tortillas, make the lime-mint aioli by mixing in mayo, lemon juice, and the mint with little bit of ground pepper.

Finally, fry the fish dipping in tempura batter in deep fry. Then assemble the tacos by placing first the fish, then the pickled carrots, and finally the aioli on top.

Enjoy hot and crispy.

MANSAF

From the pastoralists of Jordan and the greater Levant, Mansaf has evolved over the years. Consumed in a far simpler version of just meat, bread, and ghee it has now added layers of flavour and texture by adding rice, nuts, and yoghurt to its repertoire. Consumed in Syria, Palestine, and the Levant, Mansaf became Jordan's national dish since the Hashemite Kingdom came into power.

This dish celebrates all major events and Eid is definitely one of those.

Ingredients

2 kg mutton chunks (large pieces, preferably with bone)

1 tbsp each of cardamom pods and cloves

1 tsp cinnamon powder or 1 stick of cinnamon

3-4 bay leaves

2 large onions, roughly chopped

2 cloves garlic, whole

1 kg plain yoghurt

2 kg rice

A pinch of saffron or turmeric

1 cup almonds and pine nuts

1 large chapati or hand-rolled bread.

5 tbsp pure ghee

Method

Boil the mutton for a few minutes and spoon off the scum that forms on it. Once a clear liquid is achieved, add bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, onions and garlic (the original dish does not include this but I feel it is required for our mutton), salt, and cook it on pressure till it is tender.

Take the yoghurt and whisk it with ½ cup of the meat broth. Add a pinch of corn-starch to make it a little thick. Add the yoghurt to a pan and without covering it, let it simmer. Make sure it does not curdle.

Once the meat is simmering, add the meat pieces only and let it boil for 10 minutes. Again, ensure that it is not curdling. Adjust for salt and a pinch of pepper.

Now onto the rice, take about half of the ghee and add a pinch of saffron or turmeric, and add the rice to it. Fry this for up to 1 minute until the rice is properly coated in the colours of the spice. Add the rest of the meat broth and any additional water you might require to cook the rice. Once the rice is cooking, start frying the almonds and pine nuts in the rest of the ghee. You can slice the almonds or use them whole.

Compiling Mansaf is another art form. Take a large serving dish and make a bed of chapati or pita bread. You can brush some of the remaining ghee onto the bread to add flavour. Ladle the yoghurt soup into this layer of bread then lay out the rice, making a well in the middle. Place the meat pieces in the middle and ladle the rest of the yoghurt soup on the rice and meat. Sprinkle the nuts and add parsley for a bit of colour.

Serve this hot and eat it the Bedouin way, all from the same dish.

MANTI

From the land of the Uyghurs and the Mongols, I bring to you Manti. These dumplings have travelled far and wide to be moulded and prepared in different ways, consumed in the settings of the many cultures it finds itself. It is mostly topped with yoghurt, garlic, or onion sauce and butter!

Today, we try the Turkish version, a toned-down easier to make and digest.

Ingredients

300g all-purpose flour

3 pinches of salt

125ml or half a cup of water

1 egg

For the filling —

250g minced beef

1 tsp salt and pepper

½ tsp cayenne pepper

1 large onion, diced

For the topping —

About half-cup yoghurt

Cayenne pepper or chilli flakes

Sumac and dried parsley or mint

¼ cup ghee or butter

Method

Knead the flour with all ingredients until it comes off the bowl nicely. Make it into 2 smooth round balls. This can take 5-8 minutes. Cut into two balls with a dough cutter and set aside, covering with a damp cloth.

Mix the meat with all the ingredients. Remember to make sure you add the juice from the grated onions as well. After about half-hour, take the dough balls out and roll them out as thinly as possible. Remember these need to resemble thin phyllo sheets. Then, take a cuter and cut across the sheets. First vertical, then horizontal. You need to achieve little squares of about 1.5 inches. Take a bit of filling and gently place it in the middle of the dough square.

Wet your index finger and thumb. Now take opposite sides of each dough and bring them together, using the moisture in your fingers to bind them. Two knots and you have a dumpling that looks like a raised pillow. Now add these to boiling water and cook for about 5 minutes at the most. You may taste them to check if they are cooked.

Before taking them off, add some cold water, to close the pores of the dumplings. Now take some of the dumpling soup water and add it to the yoghurt to give it a liquid-like texture. Add crushed garlic, salt, and pepper, and pour the yoghurt over the bowl of hot dumplings.

Heat some butter or ghee and once it is hot, add some cayenne pepper then pour it sizzling over the manta.

Add sprinkling of sumac, dried mint, or parsley.

MA'MOUL

The ancient Egyptians loved their cookies and the region of the Middle East continued with this tradition when the Fatimid Caliphate rule introduced serving cookies on Eid day. Al Fitra was given out in thousands and wooden cookie moulds were used with messages like kol o oshkor which means 'eat and be thankful'.

Ma'moul is consumed across the Levant and today it sits as one of the most popular cookies of all time.

Ingredients

Flour

350g semolina or suji

130g melted butter

¼ cup oil

¼ cup corn-starch

2/3 cup powdered sugar

¼ tsp salt

1 tsp baking powder

¼ cup milk

1 tsp rose water

For the filling —

200g Medjool dates

1 tsp cinnamon powder

¼ cup sugar

200g pistachios

2 tbsp softened butter

1 tsp rose water

Method

Mix the semolina with the butter and the oil properly. Refrigerate it overnight if possible or leave it for up to 4 hours. For the filling, take 200g Medjool dates and them blend with the cinnamon and make small balls, and set aside.

Blend the pistachios and sugar until it is semi-powdery then add 2 tbsp softened butter and rose water and blend some more so you can make them into small balls too.

Now take the dough and mix with a fork then add the baking powder, powdered sugar, corn starch, and salt, and mix well. Now add the milk and rose water, and mix again making it slightly moister. Refrigerate this for an hour. Spoon out a small portion then hand roll it into a ball. Now make a dent or a shallow space in the ball and place the date filling or the pistachio ones, and cover it with the dough.

You can use a pitha mould or cookie shaper to give one side of the ma'moul a certain design. Once your ma'mouls have been stuffed, refrigerate for another half hour. Bake the ma'moul at 180° C for 20 minutes. Sprinkle a dusting of powdered sugar on top and serve with mint tea.

270,Exploring the causes and symptoms of dementia,"Uncover the complexities of Dementia as we explore its underlying causes and symptoms.

Dementia is a cruel debilitating disease that affects the lives of millions of people across the globe. It is a terrifying condition that slowly erases people's memories, their ability to think and reason, and their ability to do daily menial tasks eventually losing their independence. Although it is easy to dismiss the early signs of dementia as ""getting old"", it is crucial to identify these symptoms and provide necessary care and support and get early treatment if necessary.

Dementia can be caused by a single or a combination of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. Alzheimer's is overall the most common disease that causes it, about 70 per cent according to scientists. In a nutshell, dementia is caused by the death of brain cells and the failure of rational function. This makes it harder to spot which disease specifically causes dementia-like symptoms and this can be attributed to several factors.

Age is the leading cause, as naturally when the body ages, the birth and repair of new cells slow down further increasing the odds of dementia. It is also entirely possible to inherit Alzheimer's or Huntington's from either parent which can cause dementia to appear earlier and more severe than expected.

There are several other risk elements including high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, diabetes, and obesity. Poor diet and smoking also put people at high risk of dementia. Smoking in particular escalates the chance of dementia by 50 per cent in some cases.

Memory loss, difficulty speaking or communicating, a sudden behaviour change, and difficulties with daily tasks can all be warning symptoms of the disease. The symptoms typically begin mildly and gradually worsen over time. It is crucial to remember that none of these symptoms alone can prove that someone has dementia, but if they continue for a while, it is worthwhile to see your doctor for a check-up.

Unfortunately, dementia is one of the diseases which have no cure in the present world. However, some treatments and interventions can manage the mental and physical symptoms. Medications combined with speech therapy and other relevant therapy sessions go a long way to prolonging degeneration.",2023-05-10 10:38:03,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/exploring-the-causes-and-symptoms-dementia-3316176,2023-05-18 10:23:26,thedailystar
271,5 health benefits of green tea,"Green tea has been widely praised for its health benefits. If you are looking to make healthier lifestyle choices, you can give Ispahani Blender's Choice Premium Green Tea a try.

Back in the times of ancient medicine, green tea was used to heal cuts, help digestion, improve the health of the heart and mind, and keep the body at the right temperature.

And its reputation as a healthy drink carries on in modern times as well. These are the five potential health benefits of green tea.

Aids in weight loss

With zero calories, a refreshing taste, and proven to aid fat-burning, green tea is the drink to choose for weight loss. In fact, green tea is so effective at reducing body fat that it is likely to be included in every fat-burning product you find. This is because green tea has been shown to improve fat oxidation and metabolic rate.

Caffeine and other plant components like catechins may be responsible for this effect due to their metabolic characteristics. It was also suggested in several types of research that the weight reduction benefits of tea polyphenols were not the consequence of caffeine alone but rather of a synergistic interaction of catechins and caffeine.

Enhances brain function

Green tea's caffeine content is lower than coffee's, yet it may still aid with attention and concentration. In addition, the amino acid L-theanine, which helps relieve anxiety and lessen insomnia, found in green tea, has a calming impact by elevating feel-good brain chemicals including Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, and serotonin. Green tea's beneficial polyphenols may also help mitigate the mental decline associated with advancing age.

Assists in lower blood sugar level

Type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance, which prevents cells, muscles, and the liver from absorbing glucose to power the body. Poorly controlled diabetes may cause heart disease, neuropathy, and vision difficulties. Green tea, however, when included in a diet that is appropriate for someone with type 2 diabetes may help lower insulin resistance.

Green tea is an excellent addition to a diabetic diet since it is low in calories, has no sugar, and has many health benefits from its natural state when consumed straight from the bag. There is also some evidence that drinking green tea or taking green tea extract may help reduce glucose levels in the blood.

Supports skin health

Not only is drinking green tea beneficial for your physical health, but it also has the potential to help you maintain your looks. Products containing green tea are often recommended by beauty professionals because of the anti-inflammatory benefits of this beverage. For instance, some suggest that using green tea supplements and cream with a 10 per cent concentration might increase skin suppleness and delay the onset of wrinkles.

Relieves cavities

Green tea's antibacterial capabilities are second to none, and regular use of the beverage also reduces the sugar content of saliva and the amount of dental plaque that builds up on teeth. Consuming unsweetened green tea daily has been found in several studies and pieces of research to be beneficial in warding off cavities and halting the progression of tooth decay.

There are many things we strive to do in order to live a healthy lifestyle. A relatively simple one would be to get yourself Ispahani Blender's Choice Premium Green Tea!",2023-04-20 17:09:15,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/5-health-benefits-green-tea-3301991,2023-05-18 10:23:27,thedailystar
272,"Understanding self-harm: A cry for help, not attention","Self-harm is a complex and often misunderstood behaviour that refers to the act of deliberately hurting oneself, typically by cutting, burning, or hitting one's own body. Although it is often associated with adolescents and young adults, self-harm can also be observed in older people. Unfortunately, despite the prevalence of self-harm in almost every part of our society, it remains shrouded in stigma.

A topic as sensitive as this stirs up a million questions in all of us; questions that almost never get asked — Why do people engage in self-harm? Are they mentally unstable or dangerous? Are they suicidal?

An open discussion is not only the best, but also our only option if we want to find these answers.

In an interview with Star Lifestyle, Dr Helal Uddin Ahmed, Associate Professor, Child, Adolescent and Family Psychiatry at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), lays out the reasons as well as common misconceptions about surrounding self-harm in our country.

""Self-harm is a way for individuals to manage intense emotional distress when they do not have the skills or resources to cope with it effectively,"" explains Dr Ahmed. ""Anxiety, inner conflict, and trauma from some past events are some of the common reasons found in people engaging in self-harm.""

It truly seems bizarre at first: coping with pain by causing more pain. At the very heart of the issue is a severe lack of healthy outlet for emotions. At some point in our lives, we are bound to find ourselves in extremely difficult situations that weigh heavy on our mental state. In the absence of proper ventilation of these emotions, they may build into something much worse making us feel like we are drowning and suffocating within ourselves.

According to Dr Ahmed, the physical pain creates endorphins; hormone that causes a momentary sense of relief from one's anxiety and/or PTSD. When done repeatedly, these self-harming acts become the only source of relief thereby making it difficult for one to stop.

The symptoms are subtle but with the right information, we can identify self-harming tendencies among a friend, family, or even ourselves.

While it is natural to be disappointed when we fail to accomplish something, the problem arises when we start seeing ourselves as failures in every sphere of life. This is in fact one of the earliest signs of self-harm. The constant urge to put yourself down and think negative can even lead you to withdraw yourself from friends and family. Once isolated, your anxiety can increase multi-fold.

As difficult as it may be, it is important to remember a close family member or friend can be your confidant in this situation. Sometimes, being able to share what's really bothering you can immediately put your mind at ease.

Many people engaging in self-harm may feel ashamed or embarrassed, leading them to hide their behaviour from loved ones and mental health professionals. However, seeking help is crucial in order to address the underlying psychological causes and prevent further harm.

Unexplained cuts, bruises, or burns are something we must not overlook in anyone we know. If you suspect that a loved one is engaging in self-harm, it is important to talk to them in a compassionate and non-judgmental way. Let them know that they are not alone and you will help them find better ways to cope with their emotions.

""It's very important to understand that self-harm is not a suicide attempt,"" says Dr Ahmed. ""On the contrary, people engaging in self-harm are often desperately trying to escape from something much bigger. They choose to this as a source of survival. They want to live.""

Dr Ahmed further explains how self-harm may be a manifestation of underlying personality traits or disorders. Individuals with borderline personality disorder may engage in self-harm as a way to regulate their emotions, while those with obsessive-compulsive disorder may do so as a way to reduce their anxiety.

Each form of self-harming pattern has a thread-like difference from another and only experienced therapists and counsellors can help effectively bring someone out of this state.

It is unfortunate that even at this age and time, where mental health awareness is more prevalent than ever before, something as critical as self-harm is still met with silence and shame. Change does not come in a day, but we must start somewhere if we wish for no one to suffer in silence anymore.

Our small steps to create a safe and supportive environment can go a long way. We can encourage them to seek help without any hesitation, engage in activities they enjoy, spend time with loved ones, and prioritise self-care activities such as exercise, sleep, and healthy eating. Ultimately, self-harm is a complex and deeply personal behaviour that requires understanding and support.

With patience, empathy, and professional help, individuals who engage in self-harm can find a path towards healing and recovery.",2023-04-20 08:52:17,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/understanding-self-harm-cry-help-not-attention-3301716,2023-05-18 10:23:29,thedailystar
273,How to know your cholesterol is high,"Between oily iftar items and the other delicious delicacies throughout the month of Ramadan, it will be very easy for some of us to delve into our favourite items and just let go. However, we must keep our cholesterol in check. High cholesterol is a fairly common problem and although most people face it in their 40s, the prevalence of high cholesterol level among individuals in their 20s and 30s is on the rise. And why wouldn't it be? Our generation is easily among the most stressful ones in history. Stress, along with several other factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, excessive weight, smoking and drinking all contribute to increased levels of cholesterol.

It can also be genetic but regardless of its cause, it is not to be taken lightly, as high cholesterol level is notorious for causing heart attacks (and other heart conditions), strokes, diabetes and even chronic kidney disease. Our bodies often try to communicate rising levels of cholesterol to us and here is how to tell if your cholesterol level is high without going to a doctor. Keep an eye out for these signs.

Frequent chest pain

Given our hectic routines and somewhat unhealthy living habits, we can be forgiven for taking chest pains as heartburns due to stress or acidity. However, frequent chest pain is also a sign that there is something wrong with our cholesterol levels. So, if medicines and all those DIY heartburn remedies do not work, chances are you have more cholesterol in your system than your body can handle. It is always a good idea to look after what we eat but when the chest pains start coming in thick and fast, that's when you truly have to re-evaluate your diet and incorporate exercising into your routine.

Sudden increase in belly fat

Sure, dad bods are in and bhuri is love but an overnight increase in belly fat is cause for concern. So, if you notice that your six pack aspirations have taken a hit while the rest of you is doing fine, you should be a bit alarmed because this means that there is excessive visceral fat in your belly and your cholesterol is slowly approaching dangerous levels.

High Blood Pressure

The most common indicator that you might be having issues with your cholesterol levels is your blood pressure. A rise in one often indicates the rise in the other. It is generally a good practice to measure your blood pressure twice per day. Occasional spikes are nothing to be worried about but if it is consistently high, a visit to the doctor is a must as this could be an indication of serious underlying conditions.

Achy breaky limbs

If your lower limbs feel like they are about to give up even after the smallest of walks, it is a sign of high cholesterol. Increased level of cholesterol blocks the arteries in your leg thereby stopping blood from being circulated back and forth properly. This is the wakeup call you need to bring about changes in your life to lower those cholesterol levels and avoid a trip to the hospital.

The only way to confirm your actual cholesterol level is through a blood test known as lipid profile. However, if you do experience any of the above, it's best to take it as a sign to get your life in order and avoid more damage. Cholesterol levels can easily be controlled through exercising, changing your dietary habits as well as limiting smoking and drinking.",2023-04-01 13:53:56,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/how-know-your-cholesterol-high-3286051,2023-05-18 10:23:30,thedailystar
274,How to quit smoking this Ramadan,"During the daytime hours of Ramadan, cigarettes or smoking while fasting of any kind is prohibited. If self-restraint is already ingrained in your mentality, the following ideas might offer the extra push you need to give up smoking for good.

A person who is trying to give up smoking may find that participating in activities throughout the month of Ramadan, such as visiting relatives, helping with the preparation of iftar or seheri meals, and praying helps keep them busy and provides assistance in doing so. Moreover, people may lessen their desire to smoke by taking measures like engaging in physical activities such as walking after iftar, consuming a large quantity of water after iftar, and avoiding the company of other individuals who smoke.

Quitting smoking during Ramadan is a great idea. Fasting has several health benefits and these advantages are most noticeable in former smokers who maintain a smoke-free lifestyle. Besides, the money saved by not buying cigarettes might be used toward other goals, such as rewarding oneself or supporting a worthy cause through donation.

By turning someone else's adversity into positivity and becoming an inspiration to them, individuals will feel empowered to stick to their Ramadan resolution to give up smoking.

Several people have found success in kicking their smoking habit throughout the month of Ramadan by adhering to what is referred to in the scientific community as the ""cold turkey"" strategy, which is based on quitting smoking rapidly. Yet, some people who smoke may need the assistance of a trained expert in addition to nicotine replacement treatment to omit this habit. In that case, one must not be shy to seek help.

It is not a simple task to give up smoking. To be tobacco-free for good, one must have a solid plan, a strong drive to do so, enough awareness, and a compelling reason to do so. Fasting is just one part of the equation. Abstinence from food causes a reduction in the amount of nicotine in the blood, which makes it much simpler for smokers to forgo the habit. But, the most significant matter is the fact that almost all individuals can refrain from smoking for more than 12 to 14 hours. This shows a shred of evidence that they possess the ability to attempt and succeed in their quest to give up the smoking habit for good.",2023-03-22 16:32:45,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/how-quit-smoking-ramadan-3278121,2023-05-18 10:23:31,thedailystar
275,Top 5 health benefits of fasting in Ramadan,"Fasting during Ramadan has numerous health benefits in addition to observing one's religious and spiritual obligations. Fasting in Ramadan highlights how giving your body a break from eating can lead you to being healthy. By approaching fasting with mindfulness and intention, both physical and spiritual benefits can be attained in this holy month. So, let's take a look at the top 5 health benefits of fasting during Ramadan.

Increase in immunity

Our immunity system gets a massive boost from fasting. The decrease in inflammation and oxidative stress reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases the production of antioxidants, which helps fight off illness and disease. According to nutritionists, fasting strengthens the lining of the intestines and enables cleansing. Moreover, it can promote autophagy, a mechanism through which cells purge themselves of harmful and damaged components.

Helping with insulin sensitivity

Insulin resistance, which is a precursor to type 2 diabetes, can occur when the body's cells stop responding to insulin. Fasting during Ramadan can help improve your insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

By relying on stored glucose for energy during fasting, your body's glucose levels decrease, leading to better glucose control and insulin sensitivity.

According to one scientific study, fasting during Ramadan has positive consequences, increasing insulin sensitivity and lowering insulin resistance, as shown by the impact of fasting on metabolic markers in humans.

Promotes weight loss

Fasting is a great way to achieve weight loss. By controlling portion sizes and reducing calorie intake, individuals can lose weight and reduce body fat during Ramadan. However, it is essential to resist the temptation to overindulge during non-fasting hours to prevent the reversal of the benefits achieved.

It is important to maintain healthy eating habits and exercise during the non-fasting hours to achieve long-lasting weight loss results. Fasting during Ramadan provides an opportunity for individuals to reset their eating habits and develop healthier relationships with food.

Good for cardiac health

Fasting during Ramadan can have a significant impact on heart health. It reduces blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which helps to lower inflammation and improve blood flow. This reduction in risk factors can lead to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. However, individuals with pre-existing heart conditions should consult with their healthcare provider before beginning to fast, so that they can observe fasting as their health will permit.

Improves brain function

One of the most remarkable benefits is the improvement in cognitive performance and brain function. During Ramadan, the production of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) increases significantly. BDNF is a protein that supports the growth and survival of brain cells, and its increased production enhances memory, learning, and mental clarity. Scientists have also been investigating the link between diet, gut health, and mental well-being, and BDNF plays a crucial role in this connection. Thus, fasting during Ramadan has a positive impact not only on spiritual health but also on mental health.",2023-03-22 15:43:40,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/top-5-health-benefits-fasting-ramadan-3278071,2023-05-18 10:23:33,thedailystar
276,Changing your food habits and lifestyle for a healthy body,"The food you put in your system will have an impact on your organs, bones, brain, and cells. Scientific research states that on average an adult loses over 300 billion cells every day and the only way to replace those cells is through the food we eat, which acts as fuel for us to replenish those lost cells.

When we eat toxic, less nutritional food our bodies stop manufacturing new healthy cells. Also, regular indulgence in processed food fills our system with chemicals and toxins that affect our organ's resilience. When we eat healthy it replenishes our body internally and we see the results of having more energy, and more spontaneity in our daily life.

A healthy body is built with good lifestyle choices and motivation to eat healthily.

Lifestyle choices

Every human is unique and so are their structure, genetic makeup, and metabolic rates. There is no 'one size fits all' in any diet. One diet plan suited to a few might not be well suited to you.

Healthy lifestyle changes on the other hand can be done by everyone that can promote healthy eating as well. Adopting a healthy lifestyle will adversely improve your mood, relax your anxieties, make you feel lighter plus it will help you fight chronic diseases.

The three most essential healthy habits you can adopt in your daily life prompt —

Fix your sleep schedule

Getting enough sleep can reduce stress and give you the energy for the next day. Sleeping late and waking up late is a vicious cycle for your healthy lifestyle. 7 to 9 hours of sleep is recommended to reap health benefits and even aid your weight management.

Make time for exercise

Come up with realistic goals for your workouts. You can find 20-30 minutes every day to work out if you commit to it. Walk-at-home exercise videos from YouTube or simply walking around your office premises can help you alter your lifestyle.

Drink more water

Hydration is important for overall health, weight loss, skin elasticity, and mood balance! Drinking 2-3 litres of water is recommended for a healthy body if that person does not have any other health issues.

Eating habits

First and foremost, making up your mind and committing to healthy eating is the key to building a healthy you. Buying healthier ingredients will make it easier​​ to change your diet. Sticking to a healthy eating plan and timetable can help. Healthy eating does not have to be expensive or complicated by keeping count of micro/macro calories.

Here are some of the tips which can help you.

Be realistic

Eating healthy does not have to be those extravagant images we have in our minds from Instagram. It does not have to be expensive items and can simply be Bengali fish curry, daal, and vegetables with some whole grains cooked at home.

Plan your meals

Plan your meals ahead of time. Making time to list down the weekly grocery with essential items means sticking to the plan with focus. Do groceries on a Saturday and use that day as your meal prep day.

Homecooked meals are better than take-aways

Cooking at home is cheaper than eating out. Plus, the ingredients we use at home are healthier and more hygienic than in restaurants. Prepping meals ahead and even making them ahead for a week can help you save time and money.

Replace bad fat with good fat

We can use oils such as sunflower, canola, or olive oil. Having fatty fish or unsaturated butter in our diet can help with omega fatty acids.

Snacking on nuts such as almonds, walnuts, and sunflower seeds instead of biscuits, cakes, or deep-fried foods is better. Changing your cooking method and shifting to shallow fry, baking, grilling, or steaming can help you consume less oil which is economical too.

Eat local vegetable

A healthy diet is not about kale and broccoli. You can eat plenty of spinach varieties found locally also. Buy local vegetables which are readily available and use them in your diet plans.

Eating in moderation

There is a Chinese saying, ""Eat only till you are 70 per cent full"". We should opt for eating a meal in moderation and on time. No food in excess is healthy, everything should be in moderation and a balance must be maintained.

Together with exercise and eating healthy, you will see great results as your body will start taking in the nutrients and detoxing the system. You shall soon start feeling great from inside and that will reflect in your daily activities and uplift your mood.",2023-03-19 13:28:25,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/changing-your-food-habits-and-lifestyle-healthy-body-3275331,2023-05-18 10:23:34,thedailystar

279,Shankha Dasgupta: Meet the genius behind Guti,"Shankha Dasgupta is the genius behind Guti, and anyone who has followed his work over the years knows precisely how exceptional he is. The much-anticipated show, Guti, came out on Chorki in January, leaving the viewers binging. There was a photoshoot where the lead characters paid homage to the award-winning show, Breaking Bad, which went viral. The seven-part series gives us insight into Dhaka's drug peddling/smuggling scene of Dhaka and tells the gritting tale of drug smuggler Sultana, played by the versatile actress Azmeri Haque Badhan.

Guti also features Shahriar Nazim Joy, Sharif Siraj, Moushumi Hamid, Nasir Uddin Khan, Arya Aritra, Tuntuni Sobhan, Arfan Mridha Shiblu, and Mahmudul among others.

While the cast certainly played a sizable role in all the praises the show is receiving from its audience, the director's immaculate storytelling abilities really make it stand out. Guti, which was meant to be a film, was deconstructed into several parts to form a web series, and the rest is history. Through his story, Shankha explores the nuances and grey that make up the world of drug smuggling and peddling.

Sultana, the protagonist, finds herself in the heart of a local drug smuggling network which requires one to be ruthless and chaotic. Still, Shankha highlights her warmer and softer side as Sultana is also portrayed as an affectionate mother who wants a better life for her daughter. The series was shot in Dhaka, Cumilla, and Chattogram and is currently streaming in Chorki.

Shankha Dasgupta, the talented director started his journey as a young prodigy in 2007, directing various television dramas and commercials for local and international clients. His talent was apparent right from the get-go, but Dasgupta really took off in 2012.

He directed the film Hello Amit and also directed a commercial for Robi Nobanno, which saw him bag the best director award from Srijon Shonman in Kolkata. He also started his own production house named Filmy Features, which also doubled down as a learning centre for aspiring film professionals around this time. Shankha then went on to direct the telefilm Taxi in 2014 and a commercial for Doze internet under this banner. He is also the co-founder of One Minute Film.

Guti, which was initially supposed to be a short film which, eventually could not materialise due to the pandemic. He later submitted the story to the minds of Chorki, who unsurprisingly loved it.

281,Wasfia Nazreen: Don’t let ageism break your spirit,"Wasfia Nazreen speaks candidly with The Daily Star at Renata Park.

Our culture has conditioned us to discussions like 'You are too old to be wearing this dress, to be dancing at clubs, climbing mountains, or even enjoying burnt marshmallows dipped in hot chocolate.' These seem like regular conversations with people who are looking out for us, but to be frank, when does the official age of 'too old' even start?

""I am surprised when people tell me that outdoor sports are only meant for younger people. With my feats, I have proved time and again that outdoor sports, including mountaineering, are meant for everyone, and at any age, as long as the person is mentally and physically fit for it,"" says Wasfia Nazreen, Bangladeshi mountaineer, activist, environmentalist, social worker, and writer.

Photo: Shahrear Kabir Heemel

The mere fact that Wasfia Nazreen, even with her extraordinary achievements and so many accolades to her name, has to face these needless validations should not come as a surprise to the world, because the reality is that 'below average mentality' strikes everywhere, is highly deep-rooted, and pays zero respect to any type of accomplishment.

This brings us to our next discussion; how trends in fashion, food, and even music these days seem to be mostly tilted towards the younger generation – perhaps people who are in their early twenties and maybe not surprising at all, even younger! And yet, the people who can actually afford indulgences regularly are those who have worked hard at least a decade after university and saved enough to be able to pamper themselves with non-essential delights.

""The fashion world is the most brutal of all. You cannot be 'walking the ramp' in your thirties. The ramp is only meant for young blood. And that's why most of us prefer to go backstage, once in our thirties, if we still want to remain connected to this hip-and-happening world,"" explains Sonia Yeasmin Isha, model, and choreographer.

In the 21st century, when we are fighting and almost winning against thousands of baseless and hurtful stereotypes, we need to include ageism in the conversation as well. Seeking validation from any generation to do something we like is unwarranted, especially when we claim to be free in this modern age and world.

Having said all that, to round it all up, we need to get back to one of the most clichéd lines in the world: Our age is just a number. For the wiser, it can mean much more. Age can be a thing of pride – where you can do whatever you wanted to do earlier and yet with more fulfilment and confidence.

283,How to pamper your mother on Mother’s Day,"Mother's Day is here and most of us are in full-on panic mode trying to figure out how to make the day special for our mothers. Well, let us put your mind at ease and share with you a few ways to pamper your mother this Mother's Day and give her the best possible day.

Make her breakfast

Start the day off by doing the thing for your mother that she has been doing for you for years: prepare breakfast. Sure, cooking may not be everyone's cup of tea but social media has practically mitigated the barrier to entry and there is an array of easy-to-prepare recipes you can look into. Besides, just the thought itself will make your mother's heart full and fill it with joy, but an edible meal would be nice too though.

Don't let her do any housework

The easiest way to pamper your mum would be to just let her relax for the day and take all of her responsibilities upon your shoulder. Get your siblings and father involved too if you can. Our mothers never really get a break from housework. On-top of that, some of them also have to juggle between work and home so a good day of rest is the least they deserve.

Give her a Spa Day

Speaking of relaxation, a nice spa day is something you can also look into to pamper your mother. Think of all the stress she has to take on every day. What better way to show her how much you appreciate everything she does on a daily basis than to help relieve some of the stress? There are options you can look into to spoil your mum the way she deserves to be spoiled.

Surprise her with a staycation

Staycations are truly an amazing way to genuinely get some time off from your daily routine and your mother deserves one too! Sure, a trip would be more wonderful but also a bit more hectic and the goal here is to not stress your mother out. So, a staycation fits that bill perfectly. Dhaka has an exquisite selection of world-class hotels to choose from so you should have no problem finding an amazing deal.

Get her something meaningful

It is true that our mothers know us best but the same applies to them too. We know them too and Mother's Day is the best opportunity to put that intel to use by getting her something very meaningful. It can be something that she has been wanting to get for a while like a baking oven or perhaps there is something she always wanted to try like painting so you can get her art supplies. It can be her all-time favourite book or a framed photo from her childhood, the possibilities are endless.

Take her to her favourite restaurant for dinner

To end a good day on a high note, take your mother out for dinner at her favourite restaurant. Given how amazing mothers are, more often than not they tend to sacrifice their preferences for the preferences of others so their choices can get overlooked. It would be nice to go to a place of her choice and let her order for a change.",2023-05-13 09:06:34,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/how-pamper-your-mother-mothers-day-3318661,2023-05-18 10:23:43,thedailystar
284,Beyond biological bonds: Celebrating all mothers,"A mother is a priceless gift. The love of a mother cannot be replaced with any amount of wealth in the world. But are biological mothers the only ones who can experience motherhood? Going beyond conventional notions and embracing the love and care that transcends biological ties, it is time to recognise and celebrate the various ways that individuals embody the role of a mother. Their stories remind us that the essence of motherhood lies in the unwavering love and selfless devotion they share with their children.

The boundless love that transcends genetic bonds is exemplified by adoptive mothers. These remarkable women open their hearts and homes to children in need, embarking on an exhausting journey to establish families through adoption. Despite everything, adoptive mothers exhibit strength and perseverance driven by an unwavering desire to provide their children with love, stability, and nurturing care. Even though their love is not biologically related, it forms an unbreakable bond that gets stronger with each passing day.

Children who are unable to live with their biological families receive temporary or long-term care from foster parents, who embrace motherhood. To provide stability and love to children in need, these selfless individuals open their homes and hearts, frequently in the face of difficult circumstances.

Foster mothers put a lot of effort into creating safe and nurturing environments, assisting children in overcoming traumas from the past and pointing them in the right direction for a better future. Their solidarity and strength engage kids to defeat difficulty, helping us to remember the ground-breaking force of adoration and the crucial job temporary mums play in their lives.

In blended families, stepmothers gracefully navigate the intricate role of motherhood. These remarkable women build unique bonds with their stepchildren and accept their role with patience and compassion. Stepmothers frequently have to balance love, direction, and respect with honouring the child's connection to their biological mother. It takes courage, understanding, and open hearts to develop associations and lay out agreeable relational intricacies. We are reminded by stepchildren and stepmothers alike that motherhood can go beyond blood ties, enabling love to transcend boundaries and nurture lasting bonds.

Additionally, motherhood can take unexpected turns. A few people decide to become mums through surrogacy, or by bringing up a kid as a single parent. To fulfil their desire to become mothers, these brave individuals defy societal norms and navigate their own individual paths. Their faithful assurance and mental fortitude act as motivation, opposing the thought that parenthood should follow an endorsed way. Their devotion to their children is a demonstration of the strength of choice and the depth of maternal instinct, and their love is unwavering.",2023-05-13 08:49:57,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/beyond-biological-bonds-celebrating-all-mothers-3318656,2023-05-18 10:23:45,thedailystar
285,Taking up nursing as a profession: Here’s All You Need to Know,"Nurses are professionals who act as a constant support system in treating the ill, elderly, and injured with an unbelievable amount of kindness, compassion, and respect. Often referred to as the heart of the healthcare system, nursing is among the very few professions in the world that work round the clock and all around the year.

Despite its challenging nature, the field of nursing holds immense potential. Today, nurses represent a community of researchers, health advocates, and educators who have evolved and expanded well beyond the simpleton definition we are familiar with. Bangladesh is no exception to this change and it is indeed high time to bring this line of work to the forefront.

Bangladesh currently offers two types of nursing courses — B.Sc in Nursing is conducted under the University of Dhaka and affiliated with the Bangladesh Nursing & Midwifery Council. Students from the Science discipline with a combined GPA of 7.0 from Secondary and Higher Secondary examinations can easily apply to this Bachelor's programme. Like any other undergraduate programme offered in the country, B.Sc in Nursing is a 4-year course but with a monthly cost of only Tk 2,500 to Tk 3,000. Depending on the institution you choose, this cost can be a one-time payment or divided over a period of four years.

The Diploma in Nursing and Midwifery is conducted directly under the Bangladesh Nursing & Midwifery Council. Students of any discipline with a combined GPA of 6.0 from their Secondary and Higher Secondary examinations are eligible to study this course with a monthly payment of only Tk 2,000 to Tk 2,500.

The significant difference in the expenses of these courses to other mainstream lines of study can make one question their quality, right?

In search of this answer, we spoke to Dr Ashik Ur Rahman, Program Director of Japan Bangladesh Friendship Nursing College (JBFNC) who had some interesting facts to share. In addition to his career as a physician, Dr. Ashik Ur Rahman has dedicated thirteen years of his life to promoting and advocating the importance of the nursing profession among all ranks of society.

""The diploma course has an employment ratio of over 90 percent upon completion while for graduates of B.Sc in Nursing, this percentage rises to an unbelievable 95 percent,"" says Dr. Rahman. Although he admits that the social stigma surrounding nurses has reduced significantly in recent years, Dr. Rahman says that we as a country still have a long way to go in recognising their true potential.

""We faced an unprecedented shortage of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic where we had only 17 thousand certified nurses,"" he says, ""This was indeed a wakeup call for everyone, and with collaborative efforts from both government and private institutions to promote this profession, we were able to train over 15 thousand students in nursing in the last three years.""

On the topic of potential abroad, Dr. Rahman stated that Japan Bangladesh Friendship Nursing College has recently sent sixteen nurses to Japan who are currently earning over Tk 2.45 lakhs each per month. Not only is this helping them become financially strong, but also the money sent back home in the form of remittances is also helping Bangladesh economically.

This International Nurses Day, perhaps the biggest challenge for us as a nation is to let go of the outdated ideas that do not let us realise the full potential of this beautiful profession. Medical professionals all over the world acknowledge nurses for all their efforts and hard work, and it is high time for us to do the same. With the right guidance our youth will also understand that nursing is not just another source of high income. This noble profession gives one the chance to meaningfully impact society and make a real difference in people's lives.",2023-05-11 09:44:55,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/taking-nursing-profession-heres-all-you-need-know-3317031,2023-05-18 10:23:46,thedailystar

""Kawaiikhoka""

20-year-old Abdullah Al Mukramin draws inspiration from all the things he grew up with. Thoroughly fascinated by Bengali culture, Mukramin often explores folklore — especially the myths and mysteries surrounding women as well as the horror element in this genre. Inspired by the works of artist Jamini Roy, Mukramin incorporates into his work all the magical things from childhood such as Thakumar Jhuli, Gopalbhar, Sisimpur, Meena. This, he says, gives him and his audience a sense of nostalgia.

After a major break, he resumed painting from 2020 during the pandemic and thanks to the support from his friends, he began posting on social media from July, 2021. Aside from Instagram, he also posts his work under the same name on TikTok. Mukramin never thought people would recognise him for his work, let alone approach him for it. ""I've gotten tons of support from strangers I've never even met for which I'm forever grateful."" Sometimes, he finds it surprising to be identified as ""the guy that paints Shakchunni"" or ""the Shakchunni artist"" considering the character often takes centre stage in his artworks. Mukramin shares that he's planning to host an exhibition sometime in June or July. Through this, he hopes to meet people who appreciate his work and gain more feedback from them. ""I really hope to have my own little gallery and art studio one day and I plan to keep on painting even in the future.""

Anisul Islam Samir has been an artist since he was a child. However, he started pursuing it seriously in 2019. Drawing artistic inspirations from Japanese manga, Studio Ghibli movies and the artworks of the Baroque period, Samir tries to stay true to his style by narrating the silly yet grim stories of his life and dreams. He says that it's only by being himself is he truly able to relate to his audience.

Samir uses both digital and traditional media and loves to work with pen and ink the most and moving forward, he wants to dabble in graffiti art. ""I look up to the Bangladeshi artists named Sayeef Mahmud and Arham Habib and am also inspired by the international artist, late Master Kim Jung Gi."" Samir is currently studying Fine Arts at the University of Development Alternative (UODA) and working as a concept artist for an upcoming Bangladeshi Sci-Fi film named Project Ommi.

Naureen Islam Emmy has been drawing for a long time; but the only formal 'training' she received was during her O' levels exams. ""That was the first time I ever had an art teacher. Besides that, I taught art at Sunbeams for four years before moving to the states, where I resumed it again. Six years ago, was when I started selling my artwork!"" Her love for Bangladesh, particularly Dhaka culture, is often found in her art. She was born and raised in the city, and she says it's hard not to be fascinated by it. ""There's always so much happening, our culture is rich with creativity!""

Most of the people who follow Emmy on Instagram are from Bangladesh, or Dhaka, or they're Bangladeshi/Bengali, so she's never had to think too much about relatability. Her aim was to show a new audience our heritage, in a fun, interesting way. Emmy mostly uses watercolour. But when she moved to the states, she discovered gouache — a hybrid of acrylic and watercolour which is water soluble, and can still work like a watercolour, but is dense enough to be made opaque like acrylic. Whilst learning to experiment with gouache, Emmy also finds herself drawn towards acrylic. She also hopes to take up oil painting in the future. For Emmy, Instagram opens up a world of amazing artists. She avidly follows the likes of Alia Kamal, Istela Imam, Farah Khandaker and her friend and fellow artist Eshita Rahman.

Faria Alley, started traditional art when she was around nine years old, since then, she picked up watercolour and acrylic. Four years ago, she started practicing digital art, primarily because she wanted to create comics and manga. ""I pretty much grew up with mangas like Inuyasha, La corda D'oro, Ranma ½, Hunter x Hunter, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood as well as Yu Yu Hakusho."" Among other influences include Archie comics and online stories. This led her to develop her own stories and today, she has about seven of them, which will either become manga or webtoons.

Since traditional painting commissions are time consuming, Alley mainly focuses on digital illustrations as a part-time hustle. One of her two art series, titled, ""What Are People Wearing In Dhaka?"" where she draws people who have a unique sense of fashion. The second is ""Yearbook,"" where she features people whom she finds interesting and adds a quote to them, much like a high school yearbook. Two of her artworks from ""What Are People Wearing?"" will be featured in the upcoming 25th National Art Exhibition in Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy this month.

Mahfuz Hossain was in his teens when he started using pen on paper, with the hopes of becoming an illustrator someday. Initially, he thought it would be difficult to achieve his dreams, due to the pressures of education and struggles of daily life, but when he finally became a fine art student, he thought he may have a bit of a chance. All he really wanted to do is make characters, illustrations and worlds. His love for music, particularly the cyberpunk-synthwave retro scene, led him to develop detailed characters like cyber chicks or black tentacles. His inspirations for conceptualising these characters come from Yoji Shinkawa, the lead character and mecha designer for the Metal Gear franchise.

Other influences include Jean 'Moebius' Giraud, Takehiko Inoue, Joe Madudeira, Bloodborne, an RPG from FromSoftware as well as the whole Warhammer 40,000 franchise. And he'd end up practicing for two- three hours, repeating seven-eight of his characters. Mahfuz feels that once you free your mind about the concept of the rules and of the lines being correct, you can do whatever you want.",2023-05-10 11:27:53,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/5-bangladeshi-artists-you-should-follow-instagram-3316226,2023-05-18 10:23:48,thedailystar
287,Top 10 email etiquettes to consider for professional use,"Email is one of the most widely used mediums of communication, and certain email etiquettes should be maintained, especially for professional instances. From sending an email to your superior at work, your colleague or putting forward a convincing sales pitch, email is the way to go. So, here are 10 email etiquettes to consider when writing or replying to an email.

Using a professional email address

Anytime you are applying for a job or inquire about anything from a professional person, you should always use an email address that will have a professional look to it, like using your full name or initials as the address. Any email you have created a long time ago and contains professionally inappropriate things like nicknames or random funny words should be avoided.

Give priority to subject line

The subject line is the first thing that your mail recipient will see upon receiving your email, hence you should always summarise the main purpose of your email in a concise manner. Avoiding anything vague or misleading subject lines should be also keep in mind so as to not confuse the recipient.

Use a polite greeting

Depending on the purpose of the email and who you are addressing, it's best to use the right level of required formality. For example, when it comes to formal emails you can use ""Dear Mr /Ms. /Dr,"" ""Hello"" or ""Hi"" for casual emails, and ""Greetings"" or ""Good day"" for other uses. Always keep in mind to use the correct designation and name of the recipient if you are aware of it.

A strong editorial emphasis

You must check your email for proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation, to make sure it's written in a clear and professional manner, and without any grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors. Also, while writing, avoid using anything that the recipient might not understand like abbreviations, acronyms and so on.

Keeping the email brief and focused

In order for your email to be concise and focused, any unnecessary or irrelevant information should be kept out. Avoiding writing long paragraphs that spiral out of context should be done to keep the email brief, and you can also use bullet points or numbered lists to get your point across.

Always be in a courteous tone

It's important that your email be derived of any rude or offensive language, in order to convey a respectful tone. Especially for professional settings, using sarcasm, humour and such, might be misinterpreted by the recipient. Using words like ""please,"" ""thank you,"" ""sorry,"" and ""regards"" will always display a courteous tone in your emails.

Be very careful when attaching files

You should always make sure you attach the right file that is necessary and relevant for your message. Checking on the file size and compatibility factor is always a good step before sending something, as you can use services like cloud storage or compressing your file to send the email perfectly.

Be fast to reply

You should always respond to an email as soon as you can if it requires a prompt and appropriate reply. Replying fast will ensure that you acknowledge the sender that the email contains important information and you are being active by following up on it.

Properly use CC and BC

CC (carbon copy) and BCC (blind carbon copy) allow you to send your email to multiple recipients at once, hence you should use them whenever it's absolutely necessary. People who need to be directly involved in the email conversation should be kept on CC while BCC should only be used when you want certain people to receive the email secretly without exposing their email addresses.

Always doublecheck your email

Before you hit the send button, you should always double check your email in case there are any factual errors or mistakes that occurred while you were writing the email. Most email services like outlook, Gmail offer spell and grammar checker tools so use those and properly review your email so that it will have the right tone, and change anything that seems unnecessary.",2023-05-10 10:51:18,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/top-10-email-etiquettes-consider-professional-use-3316196,2023-05-18 10:23:50,thedailystar
288,How to offer criticism without being rude,"Criticism is part and parcel of life. It is quintessential in improving our choices and actions. It can help us reach heights that we might not have achieved otherwise. However, no one likes being on the receiving end of criticism, as it can be a hard pill to swallow.

Providing constructive criticism is an art. It requires empathy, sensitivity and a way to tug the heart of the person without hurting them, or rather minimising the hurt on the receiving end so that they understand their shortcomings and find it in their heart to improve. Mastering this art requires practice and reflection. So, here are some ways on how you can deliver better constructive criticisms without coming off as rude or unkind.

Be mindful of your tone and body language

The tone has the power to change the meaning of your message and the intention behind it. While there will be occasions demanding a harsher tone, in most cases, keep your volume down, maintain a relaxed body language, keep a normal demeanour, and be respectful in your tone. Be calm. Make sure you aren't frowning, glaring, or crossing your arms as these subtle cues can raise the other person's defensiveness.

Deliver feedback in private

If you criticise someone in front of others publicly, they will always feel attacked and publicly shamed. So, the best approach is to have this conversation in private, in the absence of anyone else.

Be straightforward and specific

Beating around the bush does not help anyone. Instead of skirting around the topic or being non-descript and vague, adopt a straightforward approach where you present the feedback concisely. Attempting to conceal your criticism through a subtle suggestion or, even worse, in the guise of a passive-aggressive remark, will only cause bewilderment or offence to the person receiving the criticism.

However, being straightforward does not permit anyone to be rude and dismissive. There is a calm and polite way to be straightforward and honest. Lacing your feedback with specificity ensures that the other person knows where and what to change and improve. Narrow your focus to the particular components that are contributing to the issue.

An example could be saying ""You were 20 minutes late to our meeting yesterday"" in place of ""You're always late.""

Provide feedback promptly

Be wary of the time you provide feedback. It is advisable to avoid giving feedback immediately after an event or situation. Instead, choose a time when the individual is not under pressure and overwhelmed. Try to provide feedback within a timeframe of 2-7 days from the occurrence of the event. This ensures that the incident is still fresh in the memories of both parties. Delaying feedback may make it less pertinent, thereby diminishing its value as a constructive tool.

For instance, if your employee is making errors, instead of waiting until the end of the month, schedule a time with them within the week to have a brief private meeting where you can discuss the errors and provide solutions.

Focus on the work rather than the person

Criticising a person directly will always turn things sour and will not incite the change you are trying to bring about. Never make it about the person's life or personality traits or attributes. Always ensure that your criticism focuses on the action or lack thereof. As an example, instead of saying ""You are lazy and slow,"" try saying ""I noticed you didn't finish the assignment on time. Try to stick to the deadline to avoid the workload piling up and rolling over.""

Start statements with ""I"" rather than ""you""

Using statements that start with ""you"" while providing constructive feedback can come across as a personal attack on the receiving party. An ""I"" statement makes the feedback less personal, puts focus on your experience, does not come off as an imposition of your own beliefs on the person, and serves as a clarity that you are sharing your own thoughts and not objectives. This primes the individual to accept and absorb your feedback in a much more positive light.

For instance, instead of saying ""You never listen to me"" which comes off as a blame on someone's personality, try saying ""I feel like you don't listen to me enough/I feel like you don't pay enough attention when I'm speaking.""

Offer suggestions instead of giving orders

Adopt a softer approach when criticising someone, including subordinates in the workplace. Being in an authoritarian position can tempt you to provide feedback as a command. While such an action might be warranted at extreme moments, it is best to offer suggestions as it raises the probability that your suggestion will be taken under consideration. Saying ""I believe another approach may yield better results"" is more effective than ""You must start doing this differently.""

Include positive comments where appropriate

Incorporating compliments can help soften the blow of criticism and make it obvious that you're there to help. This approach allows individuals to dedicate time to refining their strengths, while simultaneously improving their weaknesses.

Have a conversation

Criticism should not be a one-sided blow. Instead, it should be an organic conversation where both parties have the opportunity to put forth their opinions and perspective. You should allow the receiving end to explain their side of the issue. Listen attentively to the individual's perspective and inquire about any underlying reasons for falling short of expectations. If necessary, engage in a constructive debate and validate the individual's thoughts and emotions. It makes it easier to handle the criticism.

By utilising these strategies and approaches for providing constructive criticism, you can create a positive impact, enhance your reputation, and guide more individuals towards achieving success.",2023-05-10 10:44:11,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/how-offer-criticism-without-being-rude-3316181,2023-05-18 10:23:51,thedailystar

An evening to unwind and pamper with a spa

Mothers work hard whether they are homemakers or working mums. They are catering to our every need and running the household smoothly, showcasing their time management and excellent managerial skills.

Scents with the power to evoke memories

An elegant and popular gift choice for mothers would be a bottle of perfume. If possible, choose Eau de parfums, eau de toilettes, or extrait de parfums over body mists as they have higher sillage and longevity.

Perfume gift boxes make the gift look that much prettier. But if you cannot get your hands on a box, then get creative and make a DIY gift basket or box with perfume, face and hand creams along with a beautiful box of chocolates.

For affordable options, you can choose Victoria's Secret, Bath and Body Works and Zara fragrances. While there is a wide range of designer options, some popular choices would be Good Girl by Carolina Herrera, Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Issey Miyake L'eau d'Issey for women, Miss Dior by Dior, Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb, Philosophy Amazing Grace and many more.

But if you truly want to strike a chord in your mother's heart, and if your budget permits, then go for niche fragrances from brands such as Parfums de Marly, Nishane, Montale, and Xerjoff.

291,Coronation and colonialism: The Kohinoor controversy,"Dignitaries, celebrities and the crème de la crème of civil society flew in from around the world to make their presence known at King Charles' coronation, a once-in-a-generation event that took place on the 6 May, 2023. Very conspicuously missing from the opulent ceremony was the Kohinoor, originally a 105-carat diamond that has long been the subject of a spat between England and post-colonial India.

As much as England maintains that the Kohinoor was ""gifted/surrendered"" to Queen Victoria a few years before the 1857 revolt, and repeatedly shoots down any notion claiming otherwise, India, the birthplace of the diamond, has a different, arguably a more controversial version of the story to tell. Indians say that after having passed through Persia and Afghanistan, the diamond was inherited and owned by an eleven-year-old Sikh prince, Maharaja Duleep Singh, who was coerced into signing the gem away in return for freeing his mother, a British prisoner at that time. The diamond was promptly removed from its original setting and lopped off by as much as 85 carats into an oval shape that would suit the tastes of its new owners. Some say that the remodelling of the diamond is emblematic of India, which the British took the liberty to reshape into a diminished version of itself to suit their needs. It now takes up a position of pride at the museum in the Tower of London, advertised as a symbol of conquest through the centuries, quietly embodying decades of resentment from visitors from the Middle East or the Indian subcontinent.

Due to its sheer size and brilliance (it was said to be the size of a coconut and named Kohinoor, ""mountain of light"" for its sparkle), it charted a bitter and bloody path across Persia, Afghanistan, right down to India, igniting greed into the hearts of rulers everywhere — eerily and uncannily reminiscent of the fictional Ring of Power in the Lord of the Rings. It seemed that every prince who owned it died a gruesome death. Over time, and owing to the violent history associated with it, the Kohinoor is said to come with a curse: The lives of the men who own the precious gem would be filled with murder and mutilation, torture and treachery. Superstition or otherwise, the undeniably violent history of the Kohinoor made the British wary and ever since Queen Victoria donned it, the diamond has always been in possession of the wives of the male heirs to the throne.

Neither the Kohinoor's destructive history, nor the controversy surrounding its arrival to Britain has dimmed its shine — there seems to be no end to its claimants, from India, to Pakistan and even Iran and Afghanistan, especially ever since the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Undoubtedly, it has always played a starring role in coronations thus far.

This time, however, things were a little different. The Queen Consort Camilla decided to pass on the crown with the Kohinoor for Queen Mary's Coronation crown. It was a smooth, deft move to avoid yet another needless controversy that could have been fuelled by its presence and perhaps, to spare the feelings of all those who have resentments associated with it. Even if governments across the globe have started to address questions pertaining to the ownership of archaeological and cultural heritage, such as the return of the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria, there are those who believe that setting a precedent like that could prove risky and result in a domino effect for the British Museum which has several such items on display. Either way, the coronation is done, and the rightful heir to the throne is finally and firmly set on it. May the grace of the throne help him make prudent decisions!",2023-05-07 10:37:59,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/coronation-and-colonialism-the-kohinoor-controversy-3313386,2023-05-18 10:23:55,thedailystar
292,Revamp your home with these creative furnishing ideas,"Have you ever stood in your fully-furnished living space and thought that it is somehow lacking 'something'? Maybe it was fine before, but lately 'home' has started to look a little...tired. If so, it may be time to bring in some new elements and discard some of the old ones to give your ever-known comfort zone a new look altogether.

When it comes to furniture, wood is a natural choice due to its durability as well as versatility. But with furniture fashion evolving constantly, you will realize that not all the pieces at home qualify as 'timeless beauty'. For instance, while a lot of us have grown up with heavy furnishing at home, that trend has now been replaced with slimmer, space-saving, minimalistic pieces.

Photo: Collected

The essence of minimalism is the removal of the unnecessary, leaving only the essentials that are functional and beautiful. This approach to furniture design emphasises the purity of form, the beauty of materials, and the harmonious balance of space. Simplistic designs with clean lines and geometric shapes result in a home that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also calm. There is no doubt that this is indeed the house you would want to come back to at the end of a tiring day.

With its understated elegance, minimalistic furnishing is a design trend that continues to captivate and inspire. Whether you are living in a small apartment or a spacious home, the right furnishings can make all the difference. In smaller spaces, it is important to make every inch count while in larger homes, the right furniture can help to define and organise different areas.

Even small changes in furnishings can have a big impact on the overall look and feel of a home. A strategically placed side table, an abstract-shaped bookshelf, or a well-chosen accent chair can add a touch of personality and warmth, transforming a space from cold and impersonal to inviting and cosy.

A new piece of furniture is more than just an addition to the house. High-quality furniture is designed to withstand the test of time and can add value to your home in the long run. However, there is a bigger elephant to be addressed here i.e. the financial aspect of it. As exciting as a furniture project may sound, it is an expensive venture and naturally one may not have the financial flexibility to purchase furniture outright.

This is where purchasing on EMI (equated monthly instalment) comes in as a great way to ease the burden of expense. Many furniture stores offer EMI options that allow you to pay for your purchases in smaller, more manageable instalments over a period of time. This not only helps to spread out the cost but also allows you to invest in quality furniture that might otherwise be out of reach. With EMI options, you can create the home of your dreams without breaking the bank, and enjoy the comfort and beauty of your new furnishings for years to come.

Remember, the key is to choose furniture that not only fits the space but also reflects your personal style and enhances your lifestyle. Whether you prefer a minimalist or a maximalist approach to design, the right furnishings can help to create a home that is beautiful, artistic as well as functional.",2023-05-07 10:30:29,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/revamp-your-home-these-creative-furnishing-ideas-3313381,2023-05-18 10:23:57,thedailystar
293,Maintaining cars during extreme summer heat,"With the scorching summer still going on, it's imperative to keep ourselves hydrated and cool to combat fatigue and heat strokes. Those who commute every day will also often find that cars tend to get heated quickly when under the extreme summer heat - something that can cause all sorts of problems for the engine and the overall longevity of the vehicle. There are also instances of cars catching fires when it is too hot, an instance you must avoid to ensure your car's well-being. Here are some basic maintenance tips to keep in mind to keep your car cool even during the summer heat.

Why do cars catch fire?

No matter how new your car may be, it can be prone to catching fire for a variety of reasons, and not all of those reasons have to do with extreme heat. One of the main causes of cars catching fire is faults in electrical wiring, which can cause short circuits and cause ignition without notice. Fuel leaks or faults in the fuel tank can cause gasoline to spill, which is highly flammable and can ignite if it comes in contact with a heat source. Be sure to check any malfunctions in the exhaust system, as a damaged or faulty exhaust can lead to temperatures in the car rising very high - risking a fire.

Aside from faulty parts or malfunctions, your car's engine or exhaust system can get heated up if exposed to high temperatures for a long time. While regular summer heat might not be a problem, temperatures higher than the standard can be problematic, so always be careful and park your car under a cool shade when not in use. Avoiding smoking inside the car and not leaving flammable materials inside are also obvious but safe ways to avoid car fires.

Common car problems in extreme heat

If you live in an area with high temperatures or a lot of humidity, your car can be prone to some common problems, including but not limited to overheating, tire blowouts, problems in the internal electrical system and battery failure. Some of the more problematic ones are listed below.

AC problems

During summer, one of the most common car problems regular commuters face has to do with the AC, which is overexerted during hotter days and thus becomes prone to damage in the long run. Overheating, in general, can also damage the engine - so be extra careful to check the engine regularly for signs of exertion and heating. Regular servicing of the AC and other internal electric wirings will also help you stay on top of your car maintenance during summer.

Tire pressure

Overheating can cause the air inside your car's tires to expand, which can always lead to blowouts or leaks. As such, it is crucial to regularly check your tire pressure during summer. Look out for any signs of tears or overinflation. The general tire pressure for passenger cars is between 30 to 35 PSI, but if you aren't sure, consult an expert or a mechanic.

Fuel evaporation

While fuel doesn't evaporate as fast as water, the fuel inside your car's tank is still prone to evaporation in areas with high humidity or during high temperatures. As such, you should keep a closer eye on your fuel consumption during summer, and keep the tank at least half full so the risk of evaporation is reduced. You should also be on top of your coolant fluid levels, which you can check using the indicator lines on the coolant reservoir unit of your car. Sufficient coolant fluid will help prevent your car from overheating.

Air filter clogging

Air filters help keep your car clean from outside dust and dirt, while ensuring the engine is safe from harmful debris. Because air filters tend to soak up a lot of dust during warmer weather, you should clean them regularly. The air filter is usually located on top of the engine, often with a cover which you will need to remove before taking out the filter to clean it.

Emergency cooling

If you are on the road and find your car is overheating, you need to conduct an emergency cooling. First and foremost, pull over to a nearby shade and turn off the engine. Let the car cool for at least 10 minutes, after which you should open the hood to let any trapped air escape. Once you feel the car has cooled off, turn on the ignition without starting the engine. Keep an eye on the temperature gauge - if it shows a normal range, feel free to start the engine. However, if there are noises from the car or the temperature remains high, keep the engine off and seek professional help.",2023-05-12 04:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/maintaining-cars-during-extreme-summer-heat-3317516,2023-05-18 10:23:58,thedailystar
294,Glanza V: the hot hatch from the late 90s,"This particular Glanza V, owned by local car enthusiast Momtahin Hassan Ingit, was restored from the ground up. The sporty design with the side skirts, trunk spoiler and hood scoop makes it as evergreen as it can get. Photos: Abrar Shareque Khan

The year is 1996: Princess Diana and Prince Charles got divorced, NASA launched their space shuttle mission, and Toyota, on the other hand, built a pocket rocket. We've all seen the Toyota Starlet, a normal family hatchback for generations in families. However, that same year, Toyota decided to divide the Starlet into three categories: the daily beater and base model Reflect - which we mostly see on the roads, the sporty pocket rocket Glanza V, and the most luxurious model out of the bunch, the Carat, which is also rare but not as much as the Glanza V.

Coming back to the Glanza, it has two variants: the Glanza S and the Glanza V, with the key difference being the engine. The Glanza S came with a naturally aspirated 1.3-litre 4EFE engine, and the Glanza V came with a 1.3-litre turbocharged 4EFTE engine. Both are mechanically similar except for the fact that the 4EFTE is turbocharged with a C56 - a 5-speed manual gearbox with LSD. The Glanza was sold exclusively in Japan but later imported to other countries.

This particular Glanza V, which is also one of the freshest of its kind, is owned by local car enthusiast Momtahin Hassan Ingit. The car has seen its fair share of transformation. It was restored from the ground up, with almost each and every panel replaced and done the right way. Even the rain shade, glasses and door trims were replaced. It's been more than 5 years since the car has been restored, but still, face to face, you won't be able to tell if any work was done to it. With brand-new headlights and tail lights, it's almost as if the car just came out of the factory. The sporty design of the Glanza with the side skirts, trunk spoiler and hood scoop makes it as evergreen as it can get.

It is not just the exterior. The interior is also in pristine condition. With an old-school dash, three-spoke GT steering wheel and bolstered seats with genuine fabric from Bride in the middle, the Glanza gives off an old-school vibe. But the power windows, power steering and entertainment system give it a hint of something way ahead of its time. In this case, the Greddy ProFec boost controller, Zeitronix zt3 AFR gauge, Works boost meter and Works fuel pressure regulator gauge enhance that feel even further.

These aren't just for show; with the Greddy ProFec boost controller, the boost of the turbo can be controlled and set to either low boost or high boost mode. The boost can be changed manually without the boost controller, but that's like going to the workshop every time you want to change it. Since it has a turbocharged engine, it is a very fuel-sensitive car, especially in a country like Bangladesh where there is no certainty of good fuel. This is where the Zeitronix AFR gauge comes into play; it will tell you if the car is running rich or lean.

Even though, from the inside, it may seem like a lot is going on in terms of performance, this Glanza is almost essentially stock with a few exceptions. The main two differences between a regular Glanza V and this one are that it has a C52 with LSD and a 5-speed gearbox, which is quite similar to the C56; while a regular Glanza V has a CT9 turbo, but this one has a CT9 hybrid turbo. The CT9 hybrid turbo provides more air and makes the boost more efficient which in turn helps it generate more boost pressure. Previously, it had an Exedy stage 2 clutch, but it was not suitable for daily driving, which is why Ingit switched back to the stock clutch. The fuel pump was changed to Tomei's 255lp fuel pump and the plugs were changed to NGK's VK20 plugs. All of these modifications make this Galnza a very OEM-esque car.

Handling-wise, this car is packed with aftermarket goodies. The shocks were replaced with brand new KYBs paired with tein tech lowerings, giving it a lower height and a stiffer feel to the suspension. To increase the steering feedback and decrease body roll, a lot of bars along with a front anti-lift kit from Whiteline are installed, starting with a Cusco carbon fibre strut bar in the front top and in the bottom it has a 2-point lower arm from Cusco along with a sway bar from Whiteline. In the back, it has a rear strut bar from Cusco, a rear sway bar and a rear pan hard rod from Whiteline. Besides that, a brand new set of economical Yokohama Japan tyres are wrapped around the infamous rim, Fifteen 52.

According to Ingit, the Glanza V performs exceptionally well and is perfect as is. Even in low boost, the car, which weighs around 900 kg, pulls with ease, and the turbo spools at 14psi in high boost, which is entirely safe for the engine and the turbo. Ingit prefers to maintain the car's OEM plus theme and faced difficulties driving it daily with the previously installed Exedy stage 2 clutch. However, the problem has been resolved since Ingit switched back to the stock clutch. In heavy traffic conditions, the car yields an average of 10 km/l. The car gave him a boatload of memories, and he looks forward to more in the future.",2023-05-05 03:50:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/glanza-v-the-hot-hatch-the-late-90s-3310966,2023-05-18 10:23:59,thedailystar
295,Toyota bZ4X - The new electric SUV on the block,"With commuting in mind, this new SUV looks to shake up a few things in the world of EVs. Images: Toyota

As the world goes by, it can be easily determined that the foreseeable future of the human race is electric. EVs in general have been getting more of the commuter treatment as electric cars are getting more accepted than ever before, and according to the statistics, so is the bZ4X - one of the first completely electronic subcompact SUVs from Toyota. With commuting in mind, this new SUV looks to shake up a few things in the world of EVs. Keep reading to find out more.

Design

The Toyota bZ4X takes many similar cues from existing models such as the Toyota C-HR and the Harrier (also known as the Venza) but still manages to keep the design different by introducing subtle sharp body lines prominent around the fenders, which is the only way it can be told that the bZ4X could be an EV. The fenders of the cars have sharp curves under which seats 20-inch wheels, while the bumper is rounded off. The headlights also reflect the sharp body language of the DRLs. The bZ4X primarily competes with the Mazda MX-30 as its local competitor and is ahead of the curve in terms of range and reliability. The bZ4X also competes with the Tesla Model Y, Hyundai IONIQ 5, and the Audi Q4 e-Tron, just to name a few EVs in the similar class.

Interior

What seems like an EV in the bZ4X is when you get inside; greeted with a squared-off steering wheel outside of the regular Toyota fashion. Behind the wheel, there is a digital gauge alongside the speedometer to show various information about the car. A 12.3-inch touchscreen with wireless smartphone mirroring is the given standard, supporting features like built-in navigation-free for three years, where later uses will require a subscription fee.

Some additional features of the Limited version include a motion-activated power liftgate, a heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, a multi-view camera, 20-inch wheels, and Softex faux-leather upholstery.

Specifications

The Toyota bZ4X comes in two trim models with either a single motor 2WD or a dual motor 4WD, where the 4WD model costs extra above the 2WD variant. When it comes to the engine both variants use AC synchronous motors, where the 2WD variant has 201 horsepower and the 4WD variant has a slight edge with 215 horsepower.

Other than that, the regular 2WD variant has a 63 kWh battery which can deliver up to 405 km of range, whereas the Limited model with two motors trades off some range for extra power, giving about 370 km of range from a larger 65.5 kWh battery.

Verdict

According to the current pricing on the official Toyota website, the Limited version starts from $46,700 with 242 miles of estimated FWD range, while the XLE version starts from $42,000 with 252 miles of estimated FWD range. Even considering the price, The Toyota bZ4X could be a fantastic e-commuter and would fly under the radar as it does not come with the 'e-flashiness'.

Although the lines in the cars are sharp, it gives off a good character to the car, making sure that a good look can answer the question of whether the car in question is an EV or not. Although the car is indeed an EV, do not expect its speeds to be in Tesla territories. Instead, expect convenience with zero emissions.

Being Toyota's first-ever car in the EV segment, it can be safely said that the electric vehicle revolution is to be expected sooner than the world thought. Being one of the largest automotive manufacturing companies in the world, they are accepting and adapting to change as soon as possible.

As the car is from Toyota, expect a couple of units even in Bangladesh - as it is the only brand where anything that is offered gets brought. Maybe when it's released, the Toyota bZ4X might be a popular pick in the local EV scene as well. Only time will tell.",2023-04-27 09:04:55,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/toyota-bz4x-the-new-electric-suv-the-block-3305616,2023-05-18 10:24:00,thedailystar
296,Meet the locally modded Toyota Altezza,"This Altezza, owned by local car enthusiast Ishan Gausul, is a 1999 model that began its life as an RS200, and in 2017, it was the only dual-tone Altezza in Bangladesh. Photos: Abrar Shareque Khan

If you played any of the Need for Speed games in the late 90s and early 2000s, you may recall seeing the Lexus IS300. But is it a Toyota or a Lexus? The answer is both. Lexus is actually a subdivision of Toyota, and the IS series was originally manufactured by Toyota and called the Toyota Altezza. Fun fact for Initial D fans: the engineering work of the Altezza was led by Nobuaki Katayama, the person in charge of the AE86 project. The name Altezza means height or highness. The Altezza came in a plethora of variants, including the IS200, IS300, RS200, AS200, and AS300, with the RS200 featuring a 3SGE engine, the IS200 and AS200 sharing a 1GFE engine, and the AS300 and IS300 sharing a non-turbo, VVTI version of the 2JZGE.

Now, let's talk about this Altezza owned by local car enthusiast Ishan Gausul. It's a 1999 model that began its life as an RS200, and in 2017, it was the only dual-tone Altezza in Bangladesh. Fast forward six years, and it's a whole different car now. The exterior is quite minimalistic and OEM-esque, with an aftermarket TRD Neo version 1 bumper in the front, TRD-style side skirts, a TRD rear bumper, and an OEM spoiler. The paint has also been changed to multi-shade white, and the rims are genuine 18-inch rims from a 350z, providing a next-to-perfect fitment. Inside, the OEM-esque theme continues, with the car originally featuring leather-powered seats with airbags and a sunroof. However, the Blitz SBC-IDIII boost controller and Zeitronix AFR gauge have been added around the steering wheel, giving it an aftermarket-ish touch. For the pleasure of music, the sound system has been completely changed to Pioneer's sound system.

Overall, factory 3SGEs are good and reliable engines, but they can be a bit lacklustre in terms of torque. This Altezza's engine has been upgraded to a 1JZGTE, the younger, turbocharged sibling of the 2JZGE. Altezzas from the factory never came turbocharged, although TRD (Toyota Racing Department) sold aftermarket parts like turbo kits and other performance parts for the 3SGE engine.

The engine wasn't the only thing that was changed; the wiring, gearbox, and everything else had to be swapped too. The engine, wiring, and transmission all came from a JZX110. The transmission is an R154, used in almost all the manual 1JZs, and the differential, shaft, and entire braking system are from the JZX110, except for the brake lines and brake pads, which are from Endless and Project MU, respectively.

Since the brakes that come with an RS200 aren't capable of stopping the car at high cruising speeds, upgrading them is always a good idea, especially when undertaking projects like this. The ECU is ECUMASTER's standalone ECU for JZX110, which was recently tuned. The intercooler has been upgraded to an Apexi intercooler for more efficient cooling, which in turn increases power, and a Cusco cooling plate has been added for good measure.

A Varex sound-controlled exhaust with a 3-inch de-cat and custom downpipe has also been installed, which helps increase power with the combination of an HKS mushroom air filter that makes the engine breathe more. To maintain the perfect air-to-fuel ratio, the engine requires more fuel as more air enters it, and that's why the injectors and fuel pump were upgraded to accommodate the higher airflow. Since the car already had JZX injectors, the only thing needed was a more powerful fuel pump, and a 255l/h pump was installed.

The Michelin Pilot Sport 4s tires on all four wheels and a fully functional TRC system with a module from a JZX110 ensure that all of this power is transferred to the ground. Most RWD cars these days either skimp on high-quality tires or a fully functional TRC system, which causes them to lose traction and spin out, leading to crashes. To add stability to the car, Cusco sway bars and Insurance coilovers were installed.

Ishan is thrilled with the car's performance so far, as he hasn't experienced any error codes, which are common in project cars. With a maximum boost of 14 psi, the car gets a mileage of about 6.5-7 km/l inside Dhaka. With the aftermarket ECU, he plans to upgrade the turbo setup to a full Tomei setup and other components to chase even more horsepower.",2023-04-21 03:50:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/meet-the-locally-modded-toyota-altezza-3302261,2023-05-18 10:24:01,thedailystar
297,Engine smoke colours - what do they indicate?,"Depending on the circumstances, your car can give off different colours of smokes. Here is a quick guide to figuring out what colour of smoke could mean what.

Cars with a combustion engine in them tend to produce byproduct gases after a complete cycle, which usually gets out of the exhaust pipe, where there are many things such as catalytic converters which purify the gases further to give off a clean fume. In many instances, cars can give off fumes which can be of different colours, where the colour of the fumes that come out of an exhaust pipe provides crucial insight into the health of a car's engine. Oftentimes, this smoke could just be water vapour. However, it could also indicate a potential head gasket leak. Hence, it is important to be wary of what kind of colour the smoke coming from your engine is - and what the colour indicates. Here is a quick guide on the possible indication of the different kinds of engine smoke colours.

Black smoke

Black smoke can be an indication that the engine might be burning too much fuel. This can be caused by a variety of issues which can be as simple as a clogged air filter, or it can arise from major problems such as a malfunctioning fuel injector or even a vacuum leak - which can cause the engine to burn more fuel than necessary, leading to decreased fuel efficiency and higher fuel costs. Black smoke can also be a sign of a more serious problem, which can indicate an engine is worn out or on the verge of dying. As such, it is important to spot black smoke and take necessary precautions as soon as possible.

Blue smoke

Blue smoke isn't quite typical as far as engine smoke colours go - and sometimes it can also mean that oil has mixed with the gas in the combustion cycle, with burnt oil being sent out through the exhaust pipe alongside any other half-burned fuel. This is an indication that engine oil is being burnt inside the engine, which is usually caused by valve seals or piston rings which are worn and dated, allowing oil to leak into the combustion chamber. Blue smoke can also be a sign of more serious problems, such as a damaged engine or engine oil being clogged.

White smoke

White smoke right after a car starts which usually tends to go away is generally not a problem, as it just might be built-up condensation which evaporates. Consistent white smoke can be an indication that the engine is burning coolant, which can be caused by a leaking head gasket or a cracked engine block. Burning coolant will also reduce the coolant level in the engine, leading to overheating and potentially resulting in engine damage or failure. Aside from that, white smoke can also be a sign of a more serious problem, such as a damaged engine or a malfunctioning cooling system - making it another smoke colour to particularly watch out for.

Grey smoke

Grey smoke can be an indication of a variety of issues, such as engine burning oil, which can leak in the combustion chamber and eventually damage the catalytic converter. This usually happens from a damaged valve stem seal, which lubricates the valves and maintains the correct air-fuel ratio. It can also indicate failed piston rings if grey-blue smoke comes out of the exhaust pipe.

It is important to note that any smoke coming from the exhaust pipe can be a sign that something is wrong with the engine and should be addressed as soon as possible. Regular maintenance can help prevent these issues and keep your car running smoothly.

Additionally, the colour of fumes coming out of an exhaust pipe can be used as an indicator of engine health. Black smoke may mean too much fuel is being burnt, blue smoke indicates oil is being burnt, white smoke means coolant is being burnt and grey smoke can indicate a variety of issues. It is best to address any smoke issue as soon as possible to prevent further damage to the engine.",2023-04-07 04:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/engine-smoke-colours-what-do-they-indicate-3290916,2023-05-18 10:24:03,thedailystar
298,Kia Carens: The Captain's Chairs are the new first class,"As the demand for SUVs slowly engulfs the entire car market like a beast, more and more cars are catching the crossover mutation. Take the Suzuki Vitara Brezza for example, a Swift hatchback pumped full of helium to crossover size, or the DFSK Glory, a seven-seater MPV that fakes the look and luxury of a full-blown body-on-frame SUV.

The Kia Carens is the latest recipient of that treatment, with the latest model ditching its proper minivan roots and embracing a more crossover-ish design. It's based on the stretched Seltos/Hyundai Creta platform and aimed primarily at India and other emerging markets.

And no, the 'Carens' nameplate isn't a tribute to your aunt Karen. According to Kia, the name is a blend of 'car' and 'Renaissance', as they believe this car will usher in a new age of family motoring. And honestly, with all the features packed into this Indian-made ride, it's hard to disagree. The Carens offers a lot for its price, defying expectations for a budget option.

Hot and futuristic

From a company that only made bland cars that nobody wanted to look at just ten years ago, the design of the new Carens is certainly stunning. Our press car, shimmering in Kia's aptly named 'Intense Red'. That hue was hotter than a stolen tamale under the blazing sun, and boy did it accentuate the curves of the fresh design. The front fascia was so futuristic that we half-expected KITT to speak out and ask us to take it for a spin. The sleek new Kia badge was flanked by some sleek LED daytime running lights (DRLs) and a black trim piece with a diamond texture acting as the front grille. Tucked away under the DRLs are the actual headlights' a massive meshed opening at the bottom of the front fascia.

From the side, the Carens had all the bells and whistles of a traditional SUV. Black wheel arches and curbside cladding? Check. Raised triangular window for the third row? Check. Sixteen-inch alloy wheels that lifted the car 195mm off the ground? Check, check, and check. And in case you missed it, the rear bottom also sported a functional red light, plus a spare wheel bolted to the floor pan. Convenient, but be prepared to get dirty in case of a flat.

Prepare yourself for a cabin surprise!

We all know in cars like these that the real magic happens on the inside, and Caren's interior doesn't disappoint. The cabin is awash in a creamy two-tone finish, with seats upholstered in perforated pleather. If you're sitting in one of the rear rows, you'll be pleased to know that you've got your own air vents on the roof, plus LED cabin lights for all three rows. And for those who like to set the mood, the Carens comes equipped with ambient lighting that offers eight different colours. Safety-wise, the car's got six airbags placed strategically throughout the interior, so you'll feel like you're getting a hug from a friendly octopus if the event of a traffic misfortune.

Like many cars in this category, I expected the front row of the Kia Carens to be lacklustre, but I was pleasantly proven wrong. The driver's seat has a fancy leather-wrapped adjustable multifunction steering wheel and a fully digital 4.2-inch TFT gauge screen. To the right of the wheel is a hidden tray for the key fob or spare change. If you're feeling parched, don't worry, the passenger has its own tray that doubles as a cup holder, plus an under-seat storage tray. There are two more cup holders in the centre console that can either heat or cool your beverage - depending on your mood.

But wait, there's more! The gear lever is in front of the cup holders, with an induction charge pad, two USB ports, and a 12-volt socket nearby. The dashboard's centrepiece is a 10.25-inch infotainment screen with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. You can even listen to ambient nature sounds through the car's BOSE sound system. Finally, the front row has its very own sunroof and switches to control all the cabin lights. All finished in a piano black that, let's be real, is unfortunately a fingerprint magnet.

The second-row experience is more 'captain' than 'cattle', with plush, separate seats and foldable tables. It's like having your own private jet on wheels, with room for your drinks and iPad thanks to the cupholders and cutouts. At the centre, there's an A/C fan control knob and bottle holder with a closable air vent, perfect for keeping your drinks at the optimal temperature. And when you're stuck in traffic, the built-in privacy curtains are a lifesaver for avoiding unwanted interactions. Being of minivan DNA the Kia has plenty of leg and headroom, even for tall folks. And if you need to haul some cargo, just fold down the seats and you're good to go.

Behind the wheel

The Carens is no speed demon, but it gets up to speed with all the grace of a sloth on a Sunday morning. The sweet spot for acceleration is somewhere between a leisurely stroll and a brisk walk, but if you're feeling frisky, you can hit triple-digit speeds in a relatively brisk 10-15 seconds. Just don't take those corners like a racecar driver, because the Carens is still tall and prone to body roll. On the bright side, the suspension does a decent job of keeping things level at higher speeds, and the cabin remains hushed even at Autobahn-worthy velocities.

With the steering wheel's quarter dead zone, you can enjoy one-handed rotation while still feeling in control. It's a family car that's all about relaxation, except when you need to pass someone on the highway.

When it comes to stopping, the brakes do their job just fine, with a pedal that responds predictably to pressure. The chassis balance and ABS are both top-notch, allowing for a graceful slowdown that won't jostle the poor souls in the third row into the second.

Verdict

Are you in the market for a spacious SUV without breaking the bank on an All-Wheel-Drive? The Kia Carens rocks a modern style, a well-stocked and tech-filled interior, and comfort features that would make luxury cars green with envy. Plus, it's built by Kia, a seasoned pro in the auto industry game. If you don't have the dough for Japanese brands or don't want to roll the dice on a Chinese option, this Indian-made Korean ride might be the one for you.

299,Dhaka Motor Show 2023: A glimpse into the future of local automobile scene,"One of the most celebrated automotive shows of the country returned for its 16th instalment, where, like every year, local automotive manufacturers showcased the latest cars, bikes and other aftermarket supporting parts for vehicles. Besides the new releases, there have also been a few tuner cars to look for as well.

This year, Dhaka Motor Show and Bike Show was held in the Bangabandhu Bangladesh China Friendship Exhibition Center in Purbachal where plenty of new cars, trucks and bikes were showcased from manufacturers such as Toyota, Haval, Suzuki, Bajaj, Fortland, Tata, Proton, etc. There were also heaps of Chinese parts manufacturers and major lubricant companies such as Mobil, Petronas and Omera showcasing their newest advancements in automotive technology.

In the event, Toyota introduced two new cars, alongside many other models, in the sub-compact and compact SUV segment, with the Veloz, a 1.5-litre four-cylinder, and the Raize, which comes in a 1.0-litre turbo or a 1.2-litre respectively. Proton also showcased two new cars: the Saga, which is manufactured exclusively in Bangladesh, and the X50 SUV.

Tata, on the other hand, had a whole fleet of vehicles, with trucks and cars, where the company announced their new Nexon and Tigor fully Electric Vehicles (EV) - an SUV and a hatchback, respectively. Tata also announced new models of trucks and showcased refreshes of their existing models.

301,30 km/h speed limit for motorcycles: how logical is it?,"How logical is this new law, and what is the public thinking about it? Is it a good idea to implement such a speed limit in the first place? Photos: Abrar Shareque Khan

A new road policy was proposed recently, which limits the maximum speed of motorcycles below 126cc inside Dhaka. The main reason behind this ruling was simple: safety. The new ruling emphasised that it is easier to control motorcycles and scooters that are below 126cc, owing to them being low in quantity and not having a lot of power behind them. The ruling also mentions that bikes above 149cc have inclined seats that bikes below 126cc don't have, which makes bikes above 149cc safer for the pillion and the biker at higher speeds.

However, the question remains: how logical is this new law, and what is the public thinking about it? Is it a good idea to implement such a speed limit in the first place? Based on the bikers we have talked to thus far, not many are happy about this new law. Some have even protested regarding this matter in both public and online. From their point of view, bikes are a mode of transport that gets them from point A to point B effortlessly - even in heavy traffic. Limiting the speed makes it tougher for them to travel intercity and forces them to spend more time on busy roads.

A local biker, who chose to remain anonymous, said, ""If the authorities were to limit the speed of the motorcycles, roads would be even more congested as the lanes are combined."" He, like many other regular bike users, believes that there are more 125cc motorcycles in the streets during rush hours mainly due to a lot of people resorting to Pathao bikes to commute. ""Most truck and bus drivers in Bangladesh don't know what signs or speed limits are, in those speeds if a truck or a bus comes from behind, there's no surety that they will brake or will maintain lanes which is where a big safety concern comes in"", the biker added. He also said that if speed limits are given, the road authority should introduce new lanes by which only bikes would travel.

Based on the bikers we have talked to thus far, not many are happy about this new law.

Another local Pathao rider said, ""The biggest downside for us Pathao riders, who currently only ride motorcycles for a living, would be that it would take more time for us to finish a trip. The total number of trips at the end of the day would decrease and to make that up we would have to share rides for longer periods, with the risk factor of trucks and buses hitting us from behind"".

On the other hand, people who aren't bikers have completely different opinions. From their point of view, people are passing most of their time in traffic. If they're travelling from Dhanmondi to Bashundhara, it's almost 19 kilometres, but it takes almost 1 hour 30 minutes on a good day making the average speed less than 20 km/h. Even if the speed limit of motorbikes below 125cc is 30 km/h, either the traffic scenario won't change at all or may improve in time, since they would slowly have to adapt to stay in the slow lane like in foreign countries.

Shahedul Islam, a local non-bike user, said, ""It may be more fuel efficient for the bikers to drive at low speeds. Limiting them to intercity and banning them from entering highway routes is a safe choice since most bikes below 125cc are underpowered and light. On highways, the wind thrust at high speeds will stress out the engine to achieve the maximum output. Brakes are also more likely to fail at those speeds"". Other regular commuters, who don't rely on bikes for daily transportation needs, shared similar sentiments - the 30 km/h speed limit for low-powered bikes is indeed a logical choice for enforcing safety in the city streets.

With all that being said, the truth remains that this new ruling doesn't quite affect a majority of bike users in Bangladesh. In the country, the majority of bikes are 149cc or above, which means most bikers are unhinged by the speed limit proposal. Some of the bikers who ride 149cc and above bikes share the same opinion as the aforementioned local Pathao rider, but the general consensus is a mixed one at best.

According to the global data organisation CEIC Data, there were 506,912 motorcycles in Bangladesh in 2022. As per the report, this was a sharp increase from the number in 2021, which was 375,252. This staggering increase in local motorcycle usage certainly warrants the need for improved traffic laws and better safety precautions.

The new ruling enforces safety but it does come with the consequences of more time spent on the roads and being stuck in traffic jams. It is also currently unclear whether or not proper research was conducted by the authorities before enforcing this rule. Without proper evidence or research backing up the speed limit implementation, the general public feels even more dubious about the feasibility of this law. However, if such speed limits and traffic laws are indeed initialised correctly, the traffic situation may certainly get better and roads will become safer for all parties involved - something we all hope for.",2023-03-17 04:20:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/30-kmh-speed-limit-motorcycles-how-logical-it-3273371,2023-05-18 10:24:08,thedailystar

Audi's E-Tron was the first electric vehicle to be registered under the Electric Vehicle (EV) category in Bangladesh, and following that, on March 4, Audi Bangladesh introduced the first electric charging station in the country.

The inauguration of the electric charging station was held during an event at the Audi service centre, which is also where the charging station is located. Jan Janowski, Deputy Head of Mission from the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, attended the inauguration. Followed by a short speech given by the guests, the inauguration took place.

To make the charging stations possible, Audi Bangladesh teamed up with a company called Siemens, which specialises in making charging stations for electric vehicles. The charging station has two power outlets so that two vehicles can be charged simultaneously.

The station itself is a fast charging station, and as per Audi Bangladesh, if a single car is charged, it will charge 60 watts. A regular Audi E-Tron will be fully charged from 0 in 1 hour 30 minutes.

If two cars are charged together, the power splits to 30 watts for each car, and from the ground, it should take about 3 hours to 3 hours and 30 minutes to fully charge the vehicles.

As per the company, this electric charger is compatible with other electric vehicles as well, such as the Mercedes EQS and BMW iX, as they share the same charging port. However, the charging station will not support plug-in hybrid vehicles as they don't come with the extra two pins that are in the charging port.",2023-03-10 04:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/audi-launches-electric-vehicle-charging-station-tejgaon-3266861,2023-05-18 10:24:11,thedailystar

305,The Audi Activesphere concept: Unorthodox in automation,"On the outside, the Activesphere has an SUV-esque design with a steep roofline which makes it look like a fastback coupe.

Audi has recently announced a new vehicle concept which can be perhaps one of the more unorthodox vehicles in terms of shape and utility. Audi's sphere concepts have always been a conversation piece, such as the Skysphere Roadster and UrbanSphere just to name a few. With the immense versatility of the body design and cutting-edge technology packed inside, Audi seems to spew new competition-bending traditional car designs. Here's a quick look at Audi's new experimental yet innovative vehicle concept.

The recently announced vehicle concept by Audi can be described as 'unorthodox' in terms of shape and utility.

Exterior

There are a lot of things the Activesphere does. On the outside, the Acivesphere has an SUV-esque design with a steep roofline which makes it look like a fastback coupe. It also integrates a pickup truck-like bed where there is also a tailgate attached at the back. Furthermore, The lower section folds down exactly like a pickup truck, where the rear glass also slides up to reveal enough space where a pair of bikes can be stored.

The interior has no screens - not even a speedometer cluster, making it clean and minimal.

In terms of size, the Audi Activesphere spans about 4.93 m in terms of longitude and about 2.07 m in width. Being 1.3 m long, it almost resembles an Audi Q8 in terms of length. When it comes to the front fascia, on either side of the steeple we see a rather muted design. The headlights are like slits with curved DRLs inside, which Audi says comes with two-piece holographic HIDs, which at a glance, look like pupils. At the rear, the thin tail lights use ultra-fine micro LED technology.

Interior

When it comes to the interior where scissor doors opening on either side welcome the driver and passengers, the Activesphere redefines infotainment and the cabin as a whole in hindsight. For starters, the interior has no screens - not even a speedometer cluster, making it clean and minimal. Everything is controlled in terms of holograms and hand gestures backed with augmented reality. Audi provides four sunglasses-like headsets for access to augmented reality functions. When it comes to driving the car in autonomous mode, the steering and pedals disappear - giving a large, clean dash, with practically nothing.

The concept shows scissor doors opening on either side welcoming the driver and passengers.

Specifications

The Audi Activesphere is a complete EV with the latest PPE (Premium Platform Electric) technology from Audi, packed with a 100 kWh battery. The battery can be fast charged with 800 V chargers which can charge the car from 0 to 80 percent in nearly 25 minutes. With slow chargers, the battery can split into two and charge simultaneously for faster charging, which is enabled with the PPE technology. Other than that, the Activesphere pushes nearly about 370 kW of power along with 720 Nm of torque which is plenty from the two motors present in it.

The Audi Sphere concepts in general show us what to expect when it comes to cars in the near future.

Verdict

The Audi Sphere concepts in general show us what to expect when it comes to cars in the near future. Since cars are starting to come out of the traditional designs, which mostly favoured cooling for the engine with aerodynamics in mind, electric motors have made possible more ways of shaping 4-wheelers due to fewer restrictions, and it goes to show whether we like it or not, the foreseeable future is electric.",2023-02-24 04:05:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/the-audi-activesphere-concept-unorthodox-automation-3255506,2023-05-18 10:24:13,thedailystar
306,Inside Runner’s three-wheeler factory,"Local manufacturing company Runner Automobiles PLC has recently announced a three-wheeler manufacturing plant in association with Bajaj, where these vehicles will be manufactured - being the first of its kind in Bangladesh.

The plant is situated in Mymensingh and is based on 10 acres of land, where Runner says the company has spent nearly Tk. 300 crores to get it up and running. It is said to make around 30,000 vehicles yearly, and a lot of it will be exported to countries nearby our peninsula, with a partnership with Pakistan already in the works.

Inside the plant, a lot of the manufacturing is automated, and assembly and welding will be mostly assisted by the means of robotic arms. Starting from scratch, the body parts are mainly made by humans with the help of machinery, part by part. From there on, most of the parts are welded together using the assistance of robotic arms, which means welds are flawless.

The parts are then coated with a primer and sanded to remove imperfections and then sent to be painted inside a vacuum painting booth. The parts are then hung up on a hanger for drying them. After drying, all the remaining parts are put together and polished. The engine, on the other hand, is completely assembled by humans. After everything is done they are sent to a dyno to check if they're producing enough power as well as to ensure the engine is up to the quality.

Bajaj RE, also locally just known as a CNG, is a three-wheeler taxi used for intra-city transport with 4-stroke engines, in general, being around 150cc or 200cc. Runner says three-wheeler transports will be more sustainable as now, the vehicles are being able to be produced in the country.

Although the prices of the completed vehicles will still be around 5 to 6 lakh, since these vehicles will be locally manufactured, more genuine parts will be available for existing vehicles. Runner also researched how many vehicles are legally registered through BRTA, and the number is quite surprising: out of 15 lakhs, only 1 lakh three-wheelers are officially registered.

Moving forward, Runner is currently working to take action against the illegally imported and unregistered three-wheelers. They also plan to launch an app like Uber only for three-wheelers. The three-wheelers are planted with a chip through which every movement will be recorded and the fares will be decided by the app. There won't be any option other than to use the app. The fares will be justified for both the passengers and three-wheeler owners.",2023-02-15 09:17:32,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/inside-runners-three-wheeler-factory-3248496,2023-05-18 10:24:15,thedailystar
307,Jeeps in the wilderness,"Most people in Bangladesh refer to ""Jeep"" as SUVs or even Crossovers, what they don't know is that Jeep is an American automobile manufacturer that introduced SUVs to the world.

The term SUV was first used in the brochure of the full-sized Jeep Cherokee SJ in 1974 but the first ever SUV is considered to be the 1984 Jeep Cherokee XJ, other than that Jeep vehicles were used by the U.S military during World War II.

Last Friday, Jeep Bangladesh hosted an event which was more of a trip for forming a club for Jeep owners. The journey started with everyone gathering at 300 feet road in front of Australian International School around 6:30 am. We waited there for everyone to arrive and meanwhile we had a light breakfast since we were running behind schedule and it was a very long drive.

At 7:30 am, everyone arrived and we set sail and started the journey. There was a roadside assistance car that escorted us and helped line up all the Jeeps. Soon enough we reached the first toll booth for entering the highway. Of course, Jeep Bangladesh had got us covered and we entered the highway.

Upon entering the highway, after going a bit, we switched routes and opted for a shortcut through a village, the roads were very narrow and not in the best condition, it was almost like touge, with hairpin blind corners and cars coming from the opposite side, took us almost an hour to cross that area and go up to the highway again.

We cruised along the highway till we reached Jannat Restaurant and Resort for a proper breakfast, it was a really short break and we got back to the road as soon as everyone finished. The next stop was around 1 pm for Friday prayers at the nearest mosque there and after that, we didn't stop anywhere else as we still had quite a bit to travel and the daylight was going away.

After 9 and a half hours of travelling, we finally reached our destination: Nazimgharh Wilderness Resort in Lalakhal, next to the Bangladesh-India border. Lunch was served right after we checked in and after we had lunch and rested for some time.

Around 8 pm, the Jeep Nations Club launch event was in order which meant live music, BBQ and the showcase of all the Jeeps there. The live music by Blues Brothers and Soul Sisters started upon going to the spot and a few moments later the Jeeps started to fill up the spot.

The first one to enter was also the oldest and most unique of the bunch, a Jeep Cherokee XJ, which has a 4-litre displacement, inline 6, 12 valve, petrol engine. Back then the big displacement was used to produce torque, so, even though it has just 176 horsepower, it produces about 301 nm torque which is great for off-roading. After that, slowly the new Jeep Wranglers started to enter.

Most of them were Rubicons with 2.0-litre inline four turbocharged engines with SELEC-TRAC 4X4 system in them. The SELEC-TRAC 4X4 system automatically engages four-wheel drive when it is required for maximum traction, giving you the best experience for off-roading. There was a turbo Sahara variant as well, 2-door,4-door, hard top, and soft top, all the variants were there. All of them were parked pointing towards the live music stage. The bonfire started eight after the cars were parked, things that day wrapped up after the live music ended and it was time for dinner.

The next day after breakfast we went off-roading towards zero point, displaying the off-roading capabilities of the cars and it was no surprise they handled it like a champ and wanted more. After an hour of sweaty and sandy off-roading, we headed back to the resort, freshened up and started to head back to Dhaka.

On the way back we had lunch at Grand palace and made several other stops along the way, after another long 10 hours the journey had finally ended.",2023-02-05 06:00:59,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/jeeps-the-wilderness-3239456,2023-05-18 10:24:16,thedailystar
308,Return of the Rotary: 2023 Mazda MX-30,"After a lot of teasing over the last few months with the possible return of the Rotary engine, Mazda finally unveiled the car at the Brussels car show earlier this year which sadly, did not come out as a sports car as the successor to the RX8, but the petrol mill came in the new MX-30 EV SUV packed as a range extender. Let's take a look at what the brand new 2023 Mazda MX-30 is all about.

The MX-30 in general is an electric midsize SUV based on Mazda's existing CX-30 model. The car was announced in late 2019 at the Tokyo Motor Show as their first iteration in the electric car segment. With 100 miles (near about 160 km) of range from its battery, the Mazda MX-30 fell short of most of its competition which was giving at least double the range and costing less than the Mazda.

The MX-30 is an interesting car for the company, from its use of sustainable materials in the interior such as cork, which Mazda claims homage to their early days as a cork manufacturing company before cars were a thing for them. The cluster inside the car is also recycled from some of their existing models, modified to fit the electric nature of the car. Another thing unique to the interior of the MX-30 is the presence of a full-sized 150 W power outlet at the bottom of the centre console, where you can power a laptop and many more things which can be necessary.

Although for Mazda, up until this year, the EV just needed to be out and exist rather than bump sales figures. As the car was only available in California, it was to meet CARB and other federal compliances for green and sustainable carbon footprints for electric vehicles.

For 2023, Mazda decided to put out hybrid versions of the car, addressing the poor range that the SUV bears, and decided to put in an 830 cc rotary engine and call it the Mazda MX-30 R-EV Skyactiv, which does not look much different from its full electric sibling. The only notable differences between them being the wheel choices and the distinctive badging with the three-pointed Wankel logo indicating the presence of the engine.

The rotary engine in the car, although, has no connection to the wheels, but the engine sits in front of the car only to produce electricity for the Lithium-ion batteries with a maximum energy capacity of 17.8 kWh - almost half the capacity of what the full EV version bares.

The R-EV has also a 50-litre petrol tank for the engine, as well as plug-in capabilities to charge the batteries. It takes about 50 minutes to charge from an AC outlet and can also be fast charged up to 36 W from a DC outlet where it takes about 25 minutes to reach 80%.

Aside from the diminished range anxiety, the MX-30 R-EV also has an electric motor. There is greater power but less torque with 170 PS (168 hp or 125 kW) and 260 Nm compared to the MX-30 EV's 145 PS (143 hp or 107 kW) and 271 Nm.

The MX-30 is one of the more important SUVs Mazda has put out. Not only it is their first car in the electric vehicle segment, but rather Mazda re-introduced technology which was long lost and overdue with the rotary, It would have been nicer if the engine had an actual connection with turning the wheels, but all we can do is hope, that after the R-EV, we also get a new iteration of the RX series sports car.",2023-02-03 04:15:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/return-the-rotary-2023-mazda-mx-30-3237726,2023-05-18 10:24:17,thedailystar

310,Flexing the wheels again,"After two years of the world being closed because of a pandemic, car meets are now a thing again. While automobile enthusiasts around the city have been waiting for a long time for their beloved car meets to return, 2023 starts off with a highly anticipated one. From tuner cars to classics as well as featuring some supercars here and there, the latest auto meet held in the Jamuna Future Park basement had it all.

Auto Rebellion, primarily a digital automotive community platform, arranged the first meet of the year - held on January 7. Meets such as these come with big hopes to spread the car culture to people all over, and this iteration was a hit - bringing more than 200 modified cars in one place, as well as having official sponsors from Subaru Bangladesh, who brought an STi S208 to showcase. There were all sorts of rare cars in the meet, such as the country's sole Honda NSX, Nissan GTR34, one of the two RX7s, a couple of Nissan GTR35s and much more. Most of the cars that showed up were Japanese-made, but there was a fair share of European cars, notable ones being the Audi R8 and the Porsche 911 Targa.

The meet also had a die-cast collectors section with a wide variety of models from 1/64 all the way to 1/18, with well-known makes from makers such as AutoArt, Kyosho, INNO and much more to choose from.

There were not just cars in the meet, there was a fair share of sports bikes as well, such as a 500cc Kawasaki Ninja, a couple of heavily modified Yamaha R15s, and CBRs which were ear-blindingly loud but were a delight to watch go around the lot.

The event ended with a performance from SkibKhan from the Bangladeshi rap crew Deshi MCs. There were also a couple of burnouts and revving of exhausts - the 'music' the whole community showed up for in the first place.

In the end, the meet was one of the more popular ones so far, and it helped start the year with a bang for local car and bike enthusiasts. As we move past the pandemic-induced lockdowns, we can expect more of such meets along the way.",2023-01-08 17:24:23,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/flexing-the-wheels-again-3215906,2023-05-18 10:24:20,thedailystar
311,Tips to take care of your car in winter,"Winter can be a tough time for your car, as the cold temperatures and harsh weather conditions can take a toll on its performance and longevity. However, with a little bit of maintenance and care, you can help your car weather the winter season in good health. Here are some tips for maintaining your car in winter:

Check your battery

Cold temperatures can drain your battery faster, so it's important to make sure it's in good condition before the winter season hits. Get it tested and consider replacing it if it's more than three years old or if it's showing signs of wear and tear.

Check your fluids

Make sure you have enough antifreeze, oil, and windshield washer fluid to get you through the winter. These fluids help keep your car running smoothly and help prevent damage caused by freezing temperatures.

Inspect your tires

Make sure your tires are properly inflated and have enough tread depth to handle slippery road conditions. Consider getting winter tires or using tire chains if you live in an area with heavy snowfall.

Remember to stay on top of regular maintenance.

Clean your car regularly

Snow, ice, and salt can all cause damage to your car's exterior and undercarriage. Regularly washing and waxing your car can help protect it from these elements and keep it looking its best.

Keep an emergency kit in your car

In case you get stranded in the cold, it's a good idea to have a few essentials on hand, such as a blanket, flashlight, warm clothing, and a first aid kit.

Stay on top of regular maintenance

Don't let the winter season be an excuse to skip out on regular maintenance tasks, such as oil changes and tune-ups. These tasks are essential for keeping your car running smoothly and can help prevent more serious problems down the road.

By following these tips, you can help your car stay in good shape throughout the winter season and avoid costly repairs down the road. A little bit of effort can go a long way in keeping your car running smoothly and safely all winter long.",2023-01-06 04:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/tips-take-care-your-car-winter-3213371,2023-05-18 10:24:21,thedailystar
312,Take a look inside the grand Vespa meet up in Dhaka,"Vespa, a reliable, small and economical scooter from Piaggio, originated in Italy around 1946, to reconstruct the country's shattered economy after World War II. Vespas were mainly used to commute around the city in the most cost-efficient way possible. With easy-to-fix, modular parts, the Vespa has been a favourite among riders for decades. These days, the Vespa has grown a large cult following, mostly around the old models - some of which are kept in pristine conditions by enthusiasts all around. Some of the old models also get restored from the ground up, where, if parts are not available, new parts are remanufactured for their scooters. Newer Vespas have been nibbling through pop culture with collaborations with singer Justin Bieber as well as with luxury fashion brands such as Christian Dior.

On December 30, 2022, Vespa Club Bangladesh hosted their Gentleman's Ride event in Shimanto Square. Being one of the last automobile meets of the year, a plethora of Vespas and mopeds showed up, each having their own special character and stories attached to it - resulting in a hugely versatile meet with a lot to see. The meet featured models starting from the 1960s to more recent models, as well as some other mopeds such as the country's only Yamaha Vino and much more.

What exactly is 'Gentleman's Ride'?

Gentleman's Ride is inspired by an international two-wheeler event, namely 'The Distinguished Gentleman's Ride', which raises awareness for men's mental health. It is mainly for classic two-wheeler enthusiasts, and all that is required to join is formal attire and a two-wheeler - which could be anything and not just specifically Vespas or mopeds. The Gentleman's ride in Bangladesh is hosted by Vespa Club Bangladesh. Founded in 2013, the club started as a collective which then grew with more enthusiasts with more organised events. The latest Gentleman's Ride had about 100 motorcycle enthusiasts from around the country - joining under one roof to share their love of all things Vespa.

Arranging meets post-pandemic

As 2022 saw the world shifting from the lockdowns and entering the post-pandemic era, many public events started being physical again - with this Vespa meet being no exception. According to the organisers, keeping Covid in mind while arranging the event meant keeping precautions in check. However, the meet still urged everyone to be careful and follow hygiene practices, such as wearing a mask and having a bottle of sanitiser. The organisers also discouraged anyone to attend if they have symptoms that fall under the category.

Types of Vespas present

There were primarily 4 eras of Vespas seen in the meet, ranging from the 1960s to the 2000s. The oldest models are the Vespa 150 VBB, which are the most common vintages from the 60s, featuring rounded designs and curved chassis. In the 1970s, we saw VBC Vespa 150 Super and other models which became more angular in design.

Photo: Akif Hamid

Moving to the 1980s and 90s, this is the era when plastic entered the picture. The horn cover, headset and certain parts were manufactured with plastic. These models are also larger as far as size is concerned. The most recent array of Vespas, which have opted for a more modern design, stems from the 2000s, and comes with automatic CVT gear and completely different design dimensions from past iterations.

As any Vespa fan would admit, what renders Vespas timeless is their mechanical simplicity, featuring elegance that is built to last generations. Witnessing so many classic Vespas together in Bangladesh was a memorable occasion for any local two-wheeler fan.

Future of the club

Photo: Akif Hamid

According to the organisers, the Vespa Club Bangladesh strives to progress in making communication between all Vespa riders, enthusiasts, mechanics, parts sellers and anyone in the community more convenient. As they have been organising more event contributions in multiple aspects of this ecosystem for the past decade, spare parts have become more available locally. Local technicians have also become more active, with the vintage Vespas beginning to receive the value they truly deserve.

Vespa Club Bangladesh is a hub connecting all Vespa enthusiasts. They are, at the core, a niche group composed of true 'gentle' people connected with their love of Vespas. Anyone who shares a common interest is welcome to join their events. All they have to do is find a stunning formal attire and wear it to the next Gentleman's Ride!",2023-01-04 08:00:39,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/take-look-inside-the-grand-vespa-meet-dhaka-3212446,2023-05-18 10:24:23,thedailystar
313,Top 5 motorbike releases in Bangladesh this year,"This year, not that many new bikes were released locally. Most manufacturers revised their existing lineup with a new colour combination or something similar, so keeping track might have been easy for most bike enthusiasts. Even then, not all the new bikes received the recognition they should have gotten as they might have confused a new bike for a revised bike. Nonetheless, as another year winds down, we look back at some of the most impactful motorbike releases this year - looking into the two-wheelers that had local fans talking.

Yamaha FZ-X 150

Yamaha FZ-X 150

As the name suggests, this bike is from the same dynasty as the FZ-S or Fazer. It is the smaller version of the XSR for the FZ lineup, hence the very similar design. It shares the same engine as the FZ-S V3 which produces around 12.4ps of power paired with a 5-speed gearbox. Since it is related to the FZ lineup, its reliability is never an issue and you also never have to worry about the availability of its parts. The FZ-X is a great alternative to XSR for a lower budget if you're out there looking to buy a scrambler. With Yamaha FZ-X 150, you get the reliability the FZ line is known for and also get the menacing looks similar to the XSR. It is currently priced at Tk. 3,57,000.

TVS Raider 125

TVS Raider 125

Earlier this year, the TVS Raider 125 was released in Bangladesh. At the first glance, one might even mistake it for the Apache 4v because of the headlight and similar design language. Even though the Raider is a commuter bike, it looks aggressive and sharp. Being a 125cc bike most people would think it doesn't have enough power, but in truth, this is the most powerful 125cc bike out there - with a power figure of 11.3ps and an air and oil-cooled 3-valve engine, which is quite unusual. The speedometer has all the features that 4v has, plus an indicator to remind you to wear your helmet. It has SBT (Synchronized Braking Technology) for better braking stability and safety. Given the price point, it is probably the best bike you can buy for Tk. 1,50,000 in this segment.

GPX Demon GR165RR

GPX Demon GR165RR

You might confuse this bike with the old GR165R since both the bikes look identical as far as looks go, and might have different colour schemes. The real difference lies in the engine, as it has a whole new 165cc liquid-cooled engine. You might think that the old one was also 165cc then what's the difference? Well, the difference is that the old one had 2 valves and the new GR165RR has 4 valves. Rather than giving it a new look, they decided to increase the power of their existing bike, which already looks very menacing and ahead of its time. It produces 19.2ps which on paper makes it the fastest sports bike in Bangladesh. To increase braking performance, they added a dual-channel ABS system as well. GR165RR is the kind of bike that has sharp looks and can go fast when you want it to go fast. As per recommendations, you cannot get a better sport bike within the price of Tk. 3,69,000.

Lifan KPT 150 4V

Lifan KPT 150 4V

The most powerful adv, as they say. Not only did they change the looks of this bike but they also came up with a new 4-valve, 4 strokes, single-cylinder 150cc liquid-cooled engine that makes 20.4ps of power. To put that in perspective, the old KPT used to make around 14.8ps. That's almost 6 more horsepower, which is an insane upgrade for a motorcycle. Even with all that power, at the end of the day, it's an adv, so the top speed is capped at 136 kmph which is more than enough for effortless highway riding. Some people may be concerned about the mileage of the bike since it has so much power but worry not, this bike gives around 40-45 kmpl, as per Lifan themselves. It also comes with abs as standard so braking won't be a problem. If you're out there looking to buy an adv that's not only comfortable but also has power, Lifan KPT 150 4v is the way to go. The bike is valued at Tk. 3,30,000.

Yamaha R15M V4

Yamaha R15M V4

This is the long-awaited bike that everyone was waiting for. Unlike other bikes that use 4v in the names of their bikes to represent it has 4 valves, Yamaha on the other hand used 'v4' to represent that it is the 4th generation of R15. However, that doesn't mean this bike doesn't come with a 4-valve engine, for even the very first R15 v1 that launched in 2008 packed the valued 4-valve. For the 4th generation of the R15, they launched two variants: the regular R15 and the R15M. Both the bikes are identical mechanically and dimensionally, but what makes them different is that the R15M has a quick shifter which makes shifting gears even more effortless. It's the first ever bike in this segment to receive that.

This bike also has the same 155cc liquid-cooled 4-valve engine that the last generation had but its power is detuned for better reliability. Now it produces 18.4ps power which, on the streets, isn't quite noticeable. The design of the R15 was heavily inspired by its bigger sibling, the R6. This bike has a lot of new techs such as you won't be able to start the bike if the bike is on stand, as well as Yamaha's app called Y-connect with which you can connect your phone to your bike. It has dual channel abs as standard. The all-new R15's sitting position is less aggressive than that of the last generation, so your back won't get sore if you are riding for a long time. This bike is one of the most premium and reliable bikes in this segment that money can buy.

315,Here are 5 of the most exciting cars launched this year,"To compete in the modern car market, manufacturers always have to come up with fresh releases every year, whether it's making a reiteration of an existing model, refreshing features that might have needed some adjustment or coming out with newer models to compete in different vehicle segments. Manufacturers also tend to introduce new cars in an existing segment that they were already making cars for. Like every year, 2022 had its fair share of new cars that had a notable impact on the global market. Before the year ends, here's a look back at the five biggest car releases that got everyone talking.

Nissan 400Z Fairlady

Nissan 400Z Fairlady

Z34 Nissan 350Z and 370Z were already quite well known for being fun, rear-wheel drive, entry-level sports cars. They featured the popular VQ35 and VQ37 engines respectively, which are reliable and have a sound note of a well-known instrument from the brass family. Being the true successor to these renowned cars, the 400Z Fairlady, also known as the Nissan Z, is the brand's newest iteration in the fun sports coupe segment. Released around the spring of 2022, the Nissan 400z completely overhauls the classic look, retaining a VQ30 with either a 9-speed Mercedes transmission or a 6-speed manual pushing about 400 HP. It is currently priced at about $39,990.

Toyota GR86

Toyota GR86/Subaru BRZ

Successor to the previous GT86/BRZ/FR-S trio from Toyota, Subaru and Scion respectively, the new GR86/BRZ eliminates all the previous complaints about lack of power from the engine, bumping the 2L flat-four boxer engine to a 2.4L boxer engine. The car also pushes about 224 HP paired with either a 6-speed manual (the only model to get) or an automatic, offering great handling and mid-range power. The Toyota GR86, released around September 2022, is perhaps one of the most improved cars on this list when compared to each model's respective predecessor. In the global market, this car's price ranges from $27,000 to $30,000.

Honda Civic Type R 2022

Honda Civic Type R

The Civic Type R has always been one of the more praised FWD sports cars that came out of Japan, where the older generation FK8 Type R set the record for having the fastest lap around the Nurburgring. But the FK8 had cooling issues and was not the best-looking car in general. The new FL5 Type R, released around October, although has the same powertrain as the previous model, sports improved cooling, a better turbo and exhaust which increases the power to 315 HP. The car also received an exterior overhaul which looks mature. It also eliminates the fake overly styled vents from the last generation, a big plus all around. Currently, its price is about $43,990.

GMC Hummer EV

GMC Hummer EV

Known for their huge form factor, road presence and off-roading prowess, The Hummer H1 and H2 have been running icons until 2010. When the cars were discontinued, many loyal fans were disappointed. However, this year saw the revival of the Hummer in the form of an electric SUV and pickup truck. GMC Hummer EV still retains the form Hummer cars were known for whilst having 1000 HP for the pickup truck version and about 850HP for the SUV models, which GMC claims can do 0-100 in about 3 seconds. This car has been available since the fall of 2022 and is priced at around $107,000.

Lotus Emira

Lotus Emira

After this year's announcement of Lotus going completely electric, the Lotus Emira marks the last gas-powered example from the company. Released in March 2022, the Emira comes with either a 3.5 L supercharged V6 from Toyota or a 2.0 L inline 4-engine from Mercedes Benz paired with a 6-speed automatic or manual. The Lotus Emira, in terms of body language, looks like their electric counterpart, the Evija, where both almost have a supercar-esque design whilst being an entry-level sports car. Lotus Emira is currently priced at about $87,000.",2022-12-23 04:05:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/here-are-5-the-most-exciting-cars-launched-year-3202841,2023-05-18 10:24:27,thedailystar
316,The dazzling electric luxury: Lucid Air,"Competing in the electric car market is challenging as technology moves at a rapid pace - contributing to a growing sector of four-wheelers and new car companies popping up all the time. While some electric vehicle brands bring new things to the table, others get labelled as yet another mere 'Tesla copy'. Although Lucid Motors is a fairly new peddling company, the Lucid Air borrows nothing from the competitors, bringing in new standards in terms of electric efficiency with a range of 530 miles whilst having 1111 horsepower for their highest trim. Here is a brief look into the brand-new electric wonder known as Lucid Air.

Lucid Air charging

Overview

Lucid Motors, an American company that primarily supplies batteries to Formula E, first came out with their Lucid Air concept back in 2017. Recently, the car went into production, and thus brought forward a lot of bleeding edge tech Lucid Motors had previously promised. Two of these key features are the headlight design and the interior, which can be directly compared with the Mercedes EQS in terms of luxury and material quality. The comparison is valid as Lucid Motors has been marketing itself as a 'luxury electric car brand'.

The Lucid Air comes in a handful of trim selections, where the base model - which Lucid calls 'pure' - comes with a single motor, producing 480 horsepower on the rear wheels. The rest of the models come with a dual motor, with horsepower and range buffs on the upper models, where the top of the line - named the Dream Edition Performance - comes with 1111 horsepower, 530 miles of range and a quarter mile time of just under a nick of 10 seconds.

245/35R21 on the front and 265/35R21 at the rear - the wheels alone give the Lucid Air an upper-class, luxury look befitting an electric sedan.

Design and exterior

At first glance, you might notice the huge set of wheels - 245/35R21 on the front and 265/ 35R21 at the rear. This gives the Lucid Air an upper-class, luxury look befitting an electric sedan. However, aside from that, the rest of the car looks fairly simple, with the lines on the design adding a futuristic feel. The car does not bear the angular and edgy electric car look, but the body lines flow through the panels in a traditional way, whilst still giving subtle cues about the powertrain not being gas-powered. The headlights have microlens arrays which help with the autopilot mode of the car as well as contribute to the futuristic cues of the car with the DRLs. All in all, it sports a rather notable design as far as electric cars go.

Lucid Air dashboard

Interior and Infotainment

The interior of the lucid air feels roomy, even though it is a mid-sized sedan. The extended windshield and sunroof which extends to the back of the car (for what Lucid initially solely was known about) allow plenty of light inside the car. This gives off a cosy environment inside the cabin, perfect for a comfortable ride. The seats are made out of premium leather, and also have massage features, which adds to the luxury aspect of the vehicle.

The infotainment system mainly consists of a whole section on the dash which consists of the gauge cluster on the driver's side and a screen in the middle, and a small touchscreen tablet which slides out in the middle of the centre console, which is also retractable. Other than that, the materials used in the interior are fairly high quality, with visible usage of mahogany on the wooden panels.

Despite being a relatively new company, Lucid Air offers features unlike its competitors.

Verdict

Lucid Motors can be seen to have a bright future ahead judging from their first iteration of a luxury electric vehicle. Starting at $87,400 and going up to $220,000 for the top-of-the-line Air Sapphire model, It goes past the complaints from people towards Teslas, where the interiors were mostly janky, whilst being similarly priced, at least compared to the base model Lucid Air. The promising Lucid Air combines massive power with the benefit of efficiency, making for an adequately good combination that helps decrease the tendency of range anxiety in electric cars.",2022-12-14 10:03:25,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/the-dazzling-electric-luxury-lucid-air-3196036,2023-05-18 10:24:28,thedailystar
317,A beginner's guide to maintaining your bikes,"Here are some of the most essential things you need to do to maintain your bike.

Over the decade, motorcycles have been increasing in numbers, owing to being an easy way to commute in the busy Dhaka city. Most people just take their bikes to a garage not knowing what they are in for. This results in people getting scammed by mechanics or receiving insufficient maintenance. Be it a Pathao rider, a student or an official, anyone who uses a bike to travel daily is often too busy to notice if their bike needs proper care. For all you busy commuters, here is a three-step breakdown of how you can maintain your bike initially, regularly and in the long run.

Initial maintenance

If you just bought your bike right off the showroom, the first thing you have to do is 'break-in' the engine. For every 2,000 kilometres you ride your bike under 4,000 rpm, the oil change interval should be after every 500 km till you hit the 2,000-kilometer mark. This phase is called the break-in period, and during this time you should remember to always use mineral-based engine oil. If you wish to shift to synthetic oil, you can do so after your break-in is completed.

It is very important that you break-in your bike so that the engine can be free, and the clutch and other components can be set up accordingly. If you don't break-in your bike properly, you may face reliability issues with the bike as the life span of the engine and clutch would be less significant than a bike that has a properly maintained break-in period.

Every time you do an oil change, change the oil filter as well. Check the tension of the chain whenever you service it and adjust it depending on if it's too loose or too tight and lube it once every 100 km. Generally, the recommended grade of engine oil for almost all Bangladeshi bikes is either 10w-40 mineral or 10w-30 mineral. Check with your dealer to find out what grade is suitable for your bike.

Regular maintenance

Now that you are done with your break-in period, you can relax a bit. Your oil and oil filter change interval should be within 1000-1500 kilometres if you wish to stick to mineral compound oils, and 3000 kilometres if you're thinking of shifting to synthetic. Afterwards, you just have to clean your air filter, spark plug, and brake pads/shoes every time you change the oil. Remember to lube the clutch cable as often as you can and adjust the clutch so that it can have a little bit of free play.

Make sure to adjust the idle of the bike and always refuel octane from a reputable pump. You can also use octane boosters to make the fuel even better but frequent usage might wear down the engine faster.

Long-term maintenance

You've put in some kilometres and now wondering if there is more to maintain your bike. The answer is yes. After 4000-5000 kilometres, adjust the tappet, which should reduce the fuel consumption and make the bike should feel smoother. Replace the brake pads/ brake shoes after 4000 km is completed.

Take note of the list of components you should replace at 10000 kilometres if these parts were not changed earlier: the air filter, sprocket-chain set, clutch cable, throttle cable, ball racer bearings and spark plug. If you follow these important steps properly and with caution, you should be on your way to maintaining a two-wheeler that will serve you for a long time. However, keep in mind that accidents and incidents can happen anytime, so always keep caution in mind whenever attempting serious repairs.",2022-12-09 03:30:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/beginners-guide-maintaining-your-bikes-3190931,2023-05-18 10:24:30,thedailystar

319,Tesla to patch software in over 1 mln vehicles due to Chinese regulations,"The software fix is being mandated to reduce accidents in Tesla's automated vehicles, states the regulator.

Tesla Inc. will reportedly fix software problems in more than 1 million vehicles, according to China's official market regulator. The software fix is being mandated to reduce accidents in Tesla's automated vehicles, states the regulator.

The action is described as a product recall under Chinese regulations, the regulator said, but it was not immediately clear if drivers might need, or would be eligible, to return vehicles to Tesla for refunds.

From 29 May, the US automaker will issue over-the-air software updates to 1.1 million units of its Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y cars, both imported and China-made, the State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement.

The regulator said the vehicles concerned did not allow drivers to turn off regenerative braking or provide enough warnings when drivers stepped on the accelerator pedal hard, which, combined, could increase the risk of collision.

The update will restore the option of switching off regenerative braking and warn drivers when they step hard on the accelerator pedal, it added.

Tesla was not immediately available for comment.

Regenerative braking works to save energy from the process of slowing a car, feeding the surplus to batteries to increase its driving range. Tesla had disabled the option to switch off the technique on cars produced after 2020.",2023-05-13 10:40:29,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/tesla-patch-software-over-1-mln-vehicles-due-chinese-regulations-3318756,2023-05-18 10:24:32,thedailystar
320,Oppo to shut down chip design unit: reports,"The company will be shutting down its Zeku unit, which made products such as the MariSilicon X chip.

Oppo, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer, recently stated that they will shut down their chip design unit due to uncertainties in the global economy and the smartphone industry.

Oppo, regarded as one of China's best-selling domestic smartphone brands, will reportedly cease operations of their Zeku unit, which was set up in 2019. This unit's products include the MariSilicon X chip, which is a neural processing unit (NPU) that improves images for video and photography taken on smartphones.

""Due to the uncertainties in the global economy and the smartphone industry, we have to make difficult adjustments for long-term development,"" a company representative said.

China's smartphone market, the world's biggest, is struggling to recover from one of its worst ever slumps as cost-conscious consumers continue to shy away from big-ticket purchases even after the country's lifting of zero-Covid curbs.

In 2022, smartphone shipments fell 14%, and total unit shipments fell below 300 million for the first time in a decade. In the first quarter, total smartphone shipments dropped 11% year-on-year to 67.2 million units, the lowest quarterly total since 2013, research firm Canalys said last month.

Oppo and their Chinese rivals such as Xiaomi set up in-house chip design units in pursuit of self-reliance after the U.S. crippled Huawei Technologies' smartphone division with sanctions that prevented it from sourcing key components.

Oppo is owned by BBK Electronics, which also owns Vivo, another top-selling Chinese smartphone brand.",2023-05-13 10:11:19,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/oppo-shut-down-chip-design-unit-reports-3318736,2023-05-18 10:24:33,thedailystar

322,Who is Linda Yaccarino: Everything you need to know about Twitter's new CEO,"Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter, has announced Linda Yaccarino as the new Chief Executive Officer of the popular social media platform. The appointment of this 59-year-old American media guru of Italian descent has sent ripples through the tech industry, sparking curiosity and speculation about the future of Twitter under her leadership. Let's delve into the background and accomplishments of Linda Yaccarino, the woman at the helm of the microblogging giant.

Born in 1963 in New York, Linda Yaccarino grew up with her parents, Bob Yaccarino and Isabella Bartolone Yaccarino, who were immigrants. She has two sisters, Lori Yaccarino Armstrong and Kate Yaccarino, who have also carved out successful careers in their respective fields.

Yaccarino received her education at Deer Park High School and later attended Penn State University. It was during her time at Penn State that she did an internship at NBC, setting the stage for her future career in media and broadcasting.

Her professional journey began at Turner Broadcasting, where she worked as the executive vice president and COO of advertising sales, marketing, and acquisitions for almost two decades, from 1992 to 2011. During her tenure at Turner, Yaccarino played a pivotal role in driving revenue growth and establishing the company as a force to be reckoned with in the media landscape.

In 2011, Yaccarino joined NBC Universal Media, LLC, as Chairman of Global Advertising & Partnerships, further cementing her reputation as a leader. Her contributions to NBC were far-reaching, spearheading innovative advertising strategies and forging crucial partnerships. It was under her guidance that NBC Universal experienced remarkable growth and became a powerhouse in the industry.

Yaccarino's decision to resign from NBC Universal Media, LLC, came as a surprise to many. However, just hours after her announcement, Elon Musk unveiled her as the new CEO of Twitter, marking a significant milestone for the social media platform. Notably, Yaccarino's appointment is groundbreaking, as she becomes the first female CEO in Twitter's history. This milestone represents a step forward for gender diversity at the highest levels of tech leadership.

326,A brief look inside Meta's recent youth safety initiatives,"Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has announced that in their ongoing effort and commitment to youth safety online, a series of youth safety initiatives to protect young people while using their apps are currently in place and are constantly reinforced. The company has been working closely with experts in mental health, child psychology, and digital literacy to build features and tools that allow users to connect online safely and responsibly, Meta announced in a recent press briefing.

Meta's approach to youth safety is based on three principles: responsible connections, age-appropriate safeguards, and innovation. To implement these principles, Meta engages in co-design with parents and children, research, and consultations to understand the needs of youth and their platforms. From these efforts, Meta has identified key takeaways, including the need to revisit the notion of parental control with a holistic approach, the importance of promoting responsible behavior online, and the desire of both teens and guardians for a network focused on online safety.

One of the initiatives is to require everyone to be at least 13 years old before they can create an account on Facebook and Instagram. Meta also deletes the account of any person under the minimum age limit as soon as they become aware of it. In addition, the company has rolled out features that let people manage their time, prevent unwanted interactions, and control what type of content and accounts they see. Since February 2023, advertisers can only use age and location to reach teens; a gender is no longer a targeting option.

Meta has partnered with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to build a global platform called ""Take it Down"" for teens who are worried intimate images they created might be shared on public online platforms without their consent. This platform can help prevent a teen's intimate images from being posted online and can be used by other companies across the tech industry.

Instagram, which is owned by Meta, has also introduced new safety features for minors. Since 2021, everyone under 16 years old defaults to a private account when they join Instagram. New accounts belonging to minors on Facebook have automatically defaulted to share with 'friends' only, and their default audience options for posts do not include 'public.'

Instagram's Supervision Tools also allow parents around the world to set up tools with their teens to supervise their Instagram experience. The tool ""Restrict"" was built specifically because of feedback from young people who said they wanted more control over what was happening when they were being bullied or harassed.

Meta has also designed resources, guides, and programs with information on teen online safety, including their Facebook Safety Center and Bullying Prevention Hub, Instagram Safety Centre, and Instagram Community Portal.

The company's Community Standards also provide additional protections for minors in policy areas such as bullying and harassment, privacy violations, and image privacy, and violent and graphic content. Under their Privacy Violations policy, Meta removes images or videos of minors under 13 years old when the content is reported by the minor, parent, or legal guardian.

Meta has also established regional initiatives and partnerships to promote online safety, such as partnering with Brac in Bangladesh to reach 10 million women and teenagers and collaborating with organizations such as Zindegi Trust in Pakistan to promote online safety. In addition, Meta has policies and enforcement mechanisms in place to ensure age-appropriate content and to safeguard users, including zero tolerance for bullying, harassment, hate speech, and self-harm.

Meta's efforts to promote youth safety are not limited to policy and enforcement mechanisms but also include educational initiatives such as the Kishor Alo Instagram Parents Guide in Bangladesh, the educational curriculum in Sri Lanka, and ChaiChats in Pakistan.

327,Bangladesh to digitally preserve 40 ethnic languages,"Including 14 endangered ones.

The government's ICT division has initiated efforts to preserve and digitise 40 ethnic languages, including 14 endangered ones. To further this initiative, a discussion meeting titled 'Font and keyboard construction of ethnic languages of Bangladesh' was held on May 7, 2023, at the Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC) seminar room of ICT Tower in Dhaka. The meeting was presided over by the Project Director of the ""Enrichment of Bengali Language in Information Technology through Research and Development"" Project (EBLICT). The event was attended by poets, writers, technologists, and common language representatives from various languages, including Chakma, Marma, Santal, Mro, Tanchangya, Telugu, Dhakaiya Urdu, and Thar.

In his speech, former director of BCC Mohammad Enamul Kabir emphasised the need to protect cultural heritage and diversity while digitalising. Professor Muhammad Zafar Iqbal stressed the importance of protecting and developing ethnic languages for generations to come. Mahbub Karim, the project president, discussed the challenges and uncertainties in the digitisation of ethnic languages and expressed hope for cooperation in the initiative. Resource persons from different languages spoke about the problems they face while using digital platforms in their own language, and offered recommendations to expand the opportunities of using their languages.

The Bangladesh Computer Council under the ICT Department has been implementing the 'Digitization of Ethnic Languages of Bangladesh' initiative since January 2022. 37 out of the 40 scheduled languages have already been sampled, and the construction of fonts and keyboards for languages with their own alphabets has been started. If successfully implemented, this effort will ensure the presence of ethnic language speakers in the digital world by enabling them to use their mother tongue on the keyboard.

330,Understanding work perks in your new job,"Congratulations on your new job! In the current overly competitive job market, it can be difficult to land the job you want - and even then, the job you want might not turn out to be how you had pictured when applying. Nevertheless, any new job comes with a certain period of self-adjustment, owing to the new environment, new colleagues and of course, new management. One smart way to fit right into a new job is to familiarise yourself with your work perks - including the terms and conditions you are compiled to follow. Here is a quick guide on what these perks can be, and how you should be wary of them in your new job.

What are work perks?

Work perks, sometimes also called employee or workplace benefits, are additional incentives implemented by the employer for the employees. These incentives are outside the set salary or wage the employee is paid, and are designed to make the workplace more appealing to the employees. Usually, the goal of work perks is to ensure the employees are working to their satisfaction while retaining good quality and quantity of work. Work perks can greatly vary depending on the type of company, business or industry, but here are some common ones you should be familiar with.

Working hours

Your working hours are the first work perk you should check in your new contract. How many hours are you expected to work in a day? If your work consists of a specific number of hours every week, be sure to read the fine print very carefully. Your remuneration may be affected if you don't put in enough hours, so, when you get that new contract, make sure to negotiate any discrepancies you may find between your agreed work hours and what has been stated in the official papers. If in-office work hours end up being too troublesome for you, you can ask your employer or the company's HR about working hybrid or shifting to work-from-home.

Holidays/time-offs

Not only should you expect your company to give you time-offs in case of emergencies and medical leaves, but you should also have annual time-offs for national holidays. Be sure to check your job contract for how many days you are allowed paid leave - which can include voluntary vacations and/or unexpected sick leaves. Usually, you will be asked by your employer to notify them a few days or a week beforehand and leave a signed form in case you apply for a temporary leave - which may or may not be covered under your paid time off.

Flexibility

When receiving your new job contract, go through all the important details and try to deduce how much flexibility you're being offered. This can be flexibility in work hours - how often are you expected to show up; flexibility in work method - can you work hybrid or from home; and flexibility in your involvement outside office hours - are you expected to work during break days or after the office is over. While you're of course bound to follow your company's rules and regulations, as an employee, you can always ask if there's room for flexibility in your work, as long you don't compromise the work done in the process.

Employee discounts

If you're working under a business selling its own line of products, you may be eligible for employee discounts when buying those products for yourself. Employee discounts are mostly common in service industries as well as hospitals and schools, where employees are granted a certain percentage of reduction when paying for admission or utility fees from the institutions they work under. Sometimes, employee discounts can extend to family members of employees as well - so if you're working in the service industry, be sure to check out any such benefits stated in your contract.

Training programs

Some employers will provide professional development opportunities for their employees, including workshops, skill development courses or in-depth training. Depending on where you work, some training programs may be mandatory so you can be more competent in your job - but some training programs can be voluntary as well. At your new job, you should take advantage of any such opportunities to further build yourself for the future.

Insurance and retirement plans

Some companies offer health insurance plans to help cover medical expenses, though terms and conditions can significantly vary across workplaces and employee levels. A lot of local companies also have pension plans in place that benefit older employees when they retire. Keep a close eye out for both insurance and retirement plans in your contract, and see if you can negotiate depending on what you're offered.

Miscellaneous perks

In your workplace, you may be allowed to have free snacks, a personal workspace that you can decorate, and/or an office lounge or cafeteria for relaxation. You may also have access to mental health services or gym memberships for your personal well-being. Look out for any and all of these perks in your new contract. These miscellaneous benefits can greatly vary depending on where you work, but more or less exist in every modern workplace, and goes a long way in keeping employees satisfied during work.",2023-05-06 10:12:22,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/understanding-work-perks-your-new-job-3312551,2023-05-18 10:24:46,thedailystar

332,Meet the startup that may fly you from Dhaka to New York in 4 hours,"Destinus aims to make its planes fly some 7000 miles in 3.5 hours or so.

Imagine leaving Dhaka after breakfast to catch a lunch meeting in New York, or an afternoon date in London, on the same day. While it may sound like fantasy, Destinus, a European hypersonic startup, is in fact making rapid progress towards its goal of ushering in a new age of hypersonic travel. With their prototypes already making successful test flights and their third prototype set to take off by the end of the year, Destinus aims to make its planes fly at hypersonic speeds, cutting down flight duration to less than a quarter of current commercial air travel.

The company's approach involves the development of smaller autonomous drones before scaling up to larger passenger-carrying aircraft. The company's prototypes are blended-body planes in the wave rider shape, a hypersonic design first conceived in the 1950s but never before reaching production. Additionally, CNN reports that Destinus is using hydrogen as its fuel of choice due to its renewable and clean energy source, increasing affordability, and ability to help the company achieve its long-range and high-speed goals. The company's long-term goal is to be fully hydrogen-powered and zero-emission, but for now, they plan to use Jet A for takeoff and then switch to hydrogen once they reach supersonic speeds.

According to a CNN report, Destinus has already secured private investment and public funding, including grants worth 26.7 million euros ($29.4 million) from the Spanish government to expand its hydrogen propulsion capabilities.

The company's ultimate goal is to have multiple classes of passengers, including economy, and to significantly reduce the price of ultra-long-range flights by the 2040s. However, Destinus acknowledges that their plans are dependent on the hydrogen market, which they do not control. To address this, Destinus recently acquired Dutch company OPRA, which has gas turbines that are already built and being sold. This acquisition will provide additional revenue and help the company weather any challenges.

Hypersonic air travel has been a topic of fascination for decades. The idea of flying at incredible speeds, reducing travel times significantly, has captured the imagination of engineers and scientists for generations. The first hypersonic flight was achieved by the North American X-15 rocket-powered aircraft in the 1960s, reaching a top speed of Mach 6.7. Since then, various countries and companies have continued to explore the potential of hypersonic travel, with NASA, the US Air Force, and private companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin all working on hypersonic projects.

On the note of super-speed air travel, Concorde was a supersonic jet that operated from 1976 to 2003, developed jointly by British and French engineers. It was a technological marvel, capable of reaching speeds of Mach 2.04, or more than twice the speed of sound, and flying from New York to London in just over three hours. However, Concorde ultimately failed to take off as a commercial success due to a number of factors, including high operating costs, noise pollution, and environmental concerns. Additionally, a tragic accident in 2000, when an Air France Concorde crashed shortly after takeoff, killing 113 people, dealt a severe blow to the aircraft's reputation and ultimately led to its retirement from service in 2003.

While there have been some setbacks and failures, the pursuit of super-speed air travel continues, with companies like Destinus aiming to finally make it a reality for commercial use.",2023-05-05 13:53:33,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/meet-the-startup-may-fly-you-dhaka-new-york-4-hours-3311926,2023-05-18 10:24:49,thedailystar
333,Tired of applying to jobs? AI can help,"Job seekers can significantly reduce the time and effort they would otherwise expend on tedious tasks like looking for job postings and filling out applications by using ChatGPT. Illustration: Zarif Faiaz

Here's the hard truth: Cover letters are boring. Crafting a resume is tedious.

And you are not alone in thinking so. We have all been there: spending countless hours tailoring and designing our resumes, and writing and rewriting our cover letters for employers who ask for them. There is no point in denying that these tasks are as tedious as they get. But maybe AI can help.

With the advent of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, job seekers can now delegate these tedious tasks to technology and focus on upskilling or pursuing meaningful endeavours that align with their interests.

It particularly helps when you ignore the alarm bells and start thinking of tools like ChatGPT as tools rather than T-1000s. ChatGPT is a cutting-edge language model that has been trained on massive amounts of data, enabling it to understand and respond to a wide range of questions and requests. With its advanced natural language processing capabilities, ChatGPT can analyse job postings, match them to a candidate's skills and experience, and even write customised cover letters and resumes.

Job seekers can significantly reduce the time and effort they would otherwise expend on tedious tasks like looking for job postings and filling out applications by using ChatGPT. Instead, they can put their mind on honing their professional skills and knowledge, pursuing side projects or hobbies, or even scheduling time for much-needed self-care. Thinking of getting that pedicure? Go get it. Delegate your friendly neighbourhood ChatGPT to write a cover letter for you.

The truth is, the ability of ChatGPT to navigate large amounts of data and present key findings in a simplified chat box is one of its key advantages. Job seekers can simply provide ChatGPT with their desired job title, location, and industry instead of spending hours searching through company websites and job boards for relevant openings. The tool can then look up and compile a list of pertinent job postings with links to applications and deadlines. It is best to keep in mind that you still need to double check the information because ChatGPT is not perfect. At least not yet.

Now comes the fun part. Once a job seeker has selected a few job openings they're interested in applying for, ChatGPT can take over the application process. By analysing the job description and a candidate's skills and experience, ChatGPT can automatically generate a customised cover letter and resume that is tailored to the specific job opening.

This not only saves the job seeker time, but it also increases the chance that recruiters and hiring managers will actually receive their application. Candidates are more likely to stand out from the crowd and land an interview if their cover letter and resume are tailored to the requirements and qualifications of the job opening.

ChatGPT can not only speed up the application process for jobs, but it can also give job seekers useful advice and insights. ChatGPT can determine areas where a candidate may need to upskill or acquire additional experience in order to be more competitive in the job market by analysing their skills and experience.

For instance, ChatGPT can suggest pertinent courses or certifications that a job seeker can take to improve their qualifications if they are interested in a particular job but lack a particular skill or certification that is necessary for the position.

Additionally, ChatGPT can offer assistance with interview preparation, including guidance on how to answer typical interview questions and techniques for emphasising one's skills and experiences in an interview.

Remember that none of these will ever replace the human touch, especially the counselling part if you are particularly interested in that part. But it can be a start-off point to gain some much needed confidence boost for your job application.

Nevertheless, some may be hesitant to entrust such an important task as job searching and application to a machine. But the reality is that artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly sophisticated and reliable. In fact, many companies and recruiters are already using AI-powered tools to streamline their hiring process and identify top candidates. And if your recruiters can use AI to recruit you, why would you hold yourself back from using AI tools to apply there.

Job seekers can level the playing field and improve their chances of landing their dream job by taking advantage of these tools. They can outsource the tiresome and time-consuming task of job searching and application to technology instead of being overburdened by it, allowing them to concentrate on upskilling, pursuing worthwhile endeavours, or just taking time for themselves.

Of course, there are still some components of the job search process, like networking and interviewing, that call for face-to-face interaction and communication. However, job seekers can free up valuable time and energy to concentrate on these more interpersonal aspects of the job search process by handing off the more time-consuming and laborious tasks to ChatGPT.

So get out there, live your life and enjoy. Come back to find your resume and cover letter ready to be sent out to your recruiters. Thank ChatGPT and move on.",2023-05-05 04:15:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/tired-applying-jobs-ai-can-help-3310986,2023-05-18 10:24:50,thedailystar
334,Meet Monash University's VR-run autonomous vehicle project,"In the modern world of electric vehicles and self-driving Teslas, imagining an autonomous vehicle might not be too difficult. To put it in simple terms, an autonomous vehicle - in theory - can operate on its own without needing a human to control or command it. However, despite recent breakthroughs in autonomous technologies, there are still difficulties in maintaining a truly automatic car - as even the most advanced self-driving ones are known to crash and fail.

Monash University's Virtual Reality Autonomous Vehicle (VRAV) project - focused on research and development of autonomous vehicles - is attempting to put a different spin on the 'self-driving car' concept, by combining it with VR technology. According to Ezazul Hoque, the Project Lead for the VRAV project at Monash Connected Autonomous Vehicle (MCAV), the aforementioned project aims to refine the technology of autonomous cars using VR while addressing technical challenges and feasibility of a VR-based automatic car in modern society.

The VRAV project, in essence, is an augmented on-road driving simulator that uses autonomous vehicles in a virtual reality setting. This allows drivers, wearing a VR headset, to test their responses to traffic conditions and find out potential problems before getting on an actual vehicle. As per the Monash University website, the project received the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) National Research Award in 2019, and since then, has secured sponsorship support from external sources, including private companies in Australia.

""The idea of integrating virtual reality technology with autonomous vehicles provides a unique and engaging way for users to interact with the vehicle,"" states Ezazul. He believes that this project will help promote public awareness and interest in autonomous vehicle technologies. Since the research his team conducts focuses on the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles, the findings can potentially increase safety on the roads, improve traffic flow and reduce environmental impact.

""Autonomous vehicles have the potential to make transportation safer, more efficient and more sustainable,"" shares Ezazul. He believes that by removing the human element from driving, autonomous vehicles can reduce the risk of accidents caused by human error, as well as increase the efficiency of transportation systems by reducing traffic congestion and improving fuel efficiency. ""Our StreetDrone technology uses a combination of sensors, cameras, radar, and Lidar to perceive the environment. These inputs are processed by an onboard computer, which uses advanced algorithms to make driving decisions, such as acceleration, braking, and steering,"" explains the Project Lead.

The project aims to push further advances in autonomous vehicle technology and enable the development of even more sophisticated and efficient transportation systems. This may involve integrating new sensors, control systems, and AI technologies to improve vehicle safety, performance, and reliability. ""I believe that the integration of virtual reality technology will continue to play an important role in the development of autonomous vehicles, allowing for more intuitive and immersive user experiences,"" adds Ezazul.

However, despite the potential of VR-assisted autonomous driving, there are obstacles to such a concept in Bangladesh - especially considering the absence of existing frameworks for autonomous vehicles. ""In countries that allow autonomous vehicles, there are specific traffic laws and regulations to ensure the safe integration of these vehicles on public roads. For example, in the US, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has laid out guidelines for testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles. These guidelines include requirements for vehicle performance, data recording and sharing, privacy and security, and more,"" states Ezazul.

He suggests that Bangladesh could consider adopting a similar framework, focusing on safety, performance, and data sharing. ""It's essential to involve stakeholders such as automotive manufacturers, technology companies, and local authorities in the process to create a comprehensive and effective regulatory environment,"" he adds. Nonetheless, he believes that if Bangladeshi laws were to allow autonomous vehicles, local production could be feasible, provided there is a supportive infrastructure, including skilled labour, technology partnerships, and investment in research and development.

As far as costs go, developing a VR-run autonomous vehicle can vary significantly depending on the complexity of the system, the level of autonomy, and the specific technology used. ""It's difficult to provide an exact cost, but development can range from tens of thousands to millions of dollars,"" says Ezazul. According to him, one potential approach to implementing autonomous vehicles in Bangladesh could involve starting with smaller, more controlled applications of the technology, such as autonomous shuttles or delivery vehicles operating on predetermined routes. This would allow for testing and refinement of the technology in a more controlled environment and could help to build public trust and support for autonomous vehicle use.

Ezazul adds that the integration of autonomous vehicles could help to address several challenges facing Bangladesh, such as traffic congestion and air pollution. ""By reducing the number of vehicles on the road and optimising traffic flow, autonomous vehicles could help to improve air quality and reduce travel time for commuters. Moreover, autonomous vehicles could provide transportation access to people who are unable to drive, such as the elderly and disabled, and help to promote greater social and economic inclusion,"" he further adds.",2023-05-05 04:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/meet-monash-universitys-vr-run-autonomous-vehicle-project-3310936,2023-05-18 10:24:52,thedailystar

344,Urbee flies high,"The gorgeous Priyontee Urbee has a 'Paris' tattoo on her feet, as a tribute to the city of love. She loves to dance, and her dazzling long hair makes her look like a Disney Princess.

The former Miss World Bangladesh contestant came for a cup of coffee with The Daily Star and revealed all about her love for acting.

How was it working in 'Close-up Ei Somoyer Kache Ashar Golpo', and how was the response to your story 'Take off'?

We all became friends during the whole shooting process. Amitabh Reza Chowdhury is really meticulous with his direction and so we could easily blend into our characters. Some people didn't like it as they had their own preferences in terms of stories, but overall, we received words of appreciation mostly.

Was it hard coming from pageantry to acting?

Acting has always been my passion from an early age. The reason I wanted to go to beauty pageants was to mitigate my shyness in front of the camera!

Commercials are highly profitable and easy to gain fame in, compared to acting. Was it the same case for you?

It's true that commercials are financially more viable compared to acting. However, there's really no comparison with that to actual acting. In commercials, I don't get enough time or space to act. Although television/OTT is a long process, this is what helped me to gain popularity among viewers.

What's the story behind your 'Paris' tattoo?

Whenever I used to read books, I was fascinated with Paris as it was the city of love, passion and colour. It's ironic that I have never been there, but I had it printed for eternity on my feet, as it will inspires me to follow my dream.

Who is your inspiration for acting? Did you get offers for silver screen?

Growing up I was fascinated with my mama, Shahiduzzaman Selim's performance on television series. I knew I had to become an actor so that people would recognise me like him. I have been offered a few films, but I don't think I'm ready yet!",2023-04-29 04:13:14,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/urbee-flies-high-3306956,2023-05-18 10:25:02,thedailystar
345,The future is bright for Roshan,"Ziaul Roshan is a dashing hero of the new generation. He made his debut in Dhallywood with the movie ""Rokto"". Since then, he has been able to capture the audience's attention by working in numerous projects.

Some of his films include ""Beporowa"", ""Dhat Teri Ki"", ""Mukhosh"", ""Psycho"", and ""Operation Sundarbans"". This year, two of his films will be released together during Eid. One is ""Paap"" directed by Saikat Nasir and the other is ""Jin"", directed by Nader Chowdhury.

You have become quite the star since debuting in 'Rokto'. How is life going for you?

For a long time, I had no idea that I would end up acting in a film. But then all of a sudden, I came to the industry. The first thing I noticed was that it is a challenge to make good films regularly. It is quite difficult to have a good story, script and director all the time. Still, I'm continuing to work on a regular basis and I want to give my best efforts.

The dreams you had when you joined this industry, have they been fulfilled since?

While I did come into this industry quite suddenly, I did not come in with too many hopes and dreams. Actors work hard to earn the love of the audience. An actor should not have any goal other than delivering a good performance.

At times, you have found yourself involved with some wrong projects. What was the reason behind this?

When a project is offered to you and a dream is shown, you cannot know for sure what the project will be like by the end. We cannot be sure if this project will stop midway through. The vision the director tells us about, can we be sure if it will be realised? That's why I have sometimes made the wrong decision when picking a project. Did every superstar in our country always choose the right films?

This upcoming Eid will see the release of two of your films. Why should the audience watch 'Paap' and 'Jin'?

All my fans have seen me in a variety of roles in films over the years. They will be really surprised to see my look in ""Paap"", which has already been heavily discussed. Those who watch this film, will do so for the entertainment it provides. I think both of these films will leave the audience entertained and satisfied. Those who enjoy horror movies will really enjoy ""Jin"". My character in this film is quite different as well.

You're quite frank when it comes to the topic of love. You have even confessed that you are in love. But many people say that you have gotten married. What is your response to this?

I haven't denied anything yet. I have even confessed about my love. But I did so because I don't like hiding things. Maybe I confessed a little late, but I did not hide it. Even if I get married, I will definitely tell everyone. But so far, I have only been in love.",2023-04-08 04:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/the-future-bright-roshan-3290691,2023-05-18 10:25:03,thedailystar
346,Sabila Nur's all round brilliance,"Sabila Nur broke the internet a week ago, because many didn't believe that a full-time actress could score a CGPA of 3.97, like she did. Through her more than decade-long career, Sabila has actually been silently brilliant for a long time.

The brilliant actress is now gearing up for the release of her debut web series, ""Mercules"", on Chorki.

On a breezy afternoon, Sabila Nur shared her academic journey and recent ventures over a cup of coffee with Star Showbiz.

You were being trolled for your high CGPA after you posted the pictures from your graduation ceremony. How did you feel after that?

I felt really heartbroken because people just saw my result, but they didn't understand how much effort I put in in past years to achieve such a high CGPA. I didn't sleep for days when I had exams. I completed my assignments in between my shooting.

However, I am also grateful for my well-wishers who appreciated and congratulated me. Because of them, I was able to forget those bad comments.

How hard was it for you to achieve this feat?

It was extremely painful for me. My parents always encouraged me to pursue my career in acting, but they also wanted me to do well in academics. I have tried to balance everything, which was hard but not impossible. With the support of my parents and the guidance of my teacher, I was able to achieve good academic results.

As you have achieved such a good result, do you have any plans to switch your career to academia?

I haven't thought about it that much. Maybe in the future, I will pursue a career in academia. Right now, I want to focus on my acting career, as I have been getting good scripts recently.

You are debuting with the web series 'Mercules' on Chorki. How hopeful are you about the series?

I am excited, as this is an interesting story to portray on screen. The director of the series, Abu Shahed Emon, is known for his film Jalaler Golpo. I have taken an indiscriminate amount of preparation for this series. I have also lost weight, and didn't work for Valentine's day because of this series. I am eagerly waiting for its release now.

The cast is star-studded as well.

It has been a great experience because when we work in dramas, we don't get to work with this big a team with such a diverse cast. I had scenes with Mamo, Gias Uddin Selim, Fazlur Rahman Babu, and Iresh Zaker. Each day of my shooting was a new learning experience for me.

You have also joined the cast of the series 'A Clueless Murder', opposite Afran Nisho. Tell us more about the series.

It's a mystery thriller series, which is my favorite genre. I can't disclose details about my role right now, but I can tell you that the audience will find me in a new avatar in this series. I am sharing the screen with one of the most versatile actors of our time, Afran Nisho, for which I am very excited. So, let's see how that goes.

Do you have any plans on doing films?

I have some scripts in my hands, but I want to finish all the pending OTT work right now.",2023-04-01 13:16:15,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/sabila-nurs-all-round-brilliance-3286021,2023-05-18 10:25:05,thedailystar
347,Sadia aims for the stars,"As a child, Sadia Ayman wanted to be a little bit of everything. Her first wish was to become a business woman, following her family tradition. The goals kept on changing with time, from doctor to fashion designer and so on, till it finally landed on the dream of becoming an actor.

""After I began working in showbiz, I realised that this is my own place,"" shared the artiste, who is also pursuing her studies in law at East West University.

Sadia's charm flared as she appeared on the screen with some of the romantic projects, including Mizanur Rahman Aryan's ""Phooler Namey Naam"", which was the first big break in her career. The actress stole hearts after donning Sara, in Shihab Shaheen's web-film, ""Mayashalik"". Now, she is all set for her silver screen debut in Gias Uddin Selim's ""Kajolrekha"", which is expected to release this Eid-ul-Azha.

""I am extremely lucky that in the initial years of my career, I got the opportunity to work with such great filmmakers,"" said Sadia, whose fans adore her for being simple both on and off the screen. ""I always get to hear from my fans that they haven't seen simplicity in actresses for a while, and that they find it in me. I hope that I will always be the same.""

Sharing a fan moment, she mentioned that a junior from her university texted her saying, ""I got admitted to East West for you, and it is really upsetting that I haven't met you yet.""

The actress shares an experience while shooting for her debut film with us. ""We shot the film deep in nature, where some of the deadliest creatures from snakes to leeches roamed freely in the surrounding areas. It was really dangerous and frightening for a person like me, who is afraid of snakes. I even had to get into the pond for a shot, where there was a snake."" Upon witnessing the snake, Sadia jumped out from the pond screaming.

To develop her acting skills, Sadia prefers watching films and reading books. She mentioned that she likes to watch romantic-thriller projects more. When it comes to books, Sadia shared that she is an avid fan of noted writer and filmmaker, Humayun Ahmed. ""I am a huge fan of him. If he were alive, I would definitely wish to work in one of his directorial projects,"" asserted the actress.

Sadia will be seen in more than ten tele-fictions, which will be released on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.",2023-03-25 10:45:28,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/sadia-aims-the-stars-3280311,2023-05-18 10:25:06,thedailystar
348,The Siam sensation continues,"Siam Ahmed's parents were much more concerned about his career in law, rather than his acting. This changed when the actor received the National Film Award two times in a row. His dedication brought him national level recognition, further elevating his career with one after another remarkable projects. The actor is currently shooting for his first Tollywood film, where he will be sharing the screen with noted Indian actor Prosenjit Chatterjee.

We caught up with Siam for a cup of coffee, a photo-session and more!

How does it feel to have won the National Film Award for the second time?

This is such a recognition that gives my parents hope and confidence that their son is on the right track. Such honour inspired them to support my work even harder. In the beginning of my career they were much more concerned about my career in law, I am lucky enough that they have taken this profession of mine seriously.

You are working with 'Bumba Da' (Prosenjit Chatterjee) in your Tollywood debut, how was the experience?

The characteristic of a great artiste is that they welcome others with warm heart and help create a space for newcomers -- Bumba Da is surely one of such artistes.

We have discussed our characters and expectations from each other. He has been providing me tips as well. I am hoping that this project will be a memorable one in my career.

You will be working in the American filmmaker Alka Raghuram's Hindi-language film, 'In the Ring: Story of a Burqa Boxer'. Could you share the story behind getting involved in the project?

One of my films was in the editing panel in Mumbai, and one of the executive producers of 'In the Ring' saw one of my footages from the film, and collected my contact number from them. They called me and asked if I am interested to give a screen test for this film. This is how I got connected with the project. We had a language training for this project too.

Since you are the only Bangladeshi artiste in the movie, are you feeling nervous?

Not nervous, but I am concerned about the fact that I will be representing the entire fraternity I belong to. I have to give my best, so that I can make my industry proud. I will be soon starting the shooting for this film.

A funny rumour you have heard about yourself…

It was recently when a director called me that he heard I had no schedule for the next two years! I was like, how come I don't know that? Where did all of the money go?

A rumour that annoyed you the most…

During my marriage, some media reported that Puja Chery attempted suicide because of me! I got extremely annoyed. I called up Puja and asked her are you dead yet?",2023-03-18 04:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/the-siam-sensation-continues-3272981,2023-05-18 10:25:08,thedailystar
349,Barshon exudes brilliance,"With a keen interest of acting, Imtiaz Barshon, following a friend's advice, took part in a stage play held near his residential area in Chattogram. It changed his life, as he felt the urge of becoming an actor after being regular in theatres. He took appreciation course in Fame School of Dance, Drama and Music.

Making his silver-screen debut with ""Unoponchash Batash"", he caught the attention and further wowed the audience when he donned the role of Barrister in the web series ""Kaiser"". Barshon, a member of Theatre Avant-garde, assisted noted filmmaker Nurul Alam Atique in his initial days. Yesterday, ""Ora 7 Jon"", featuring Barshon hit the theatres across the country.

""My passion for acting grew gradually, as I was involved with theatres and began working in this fraternity,"" shared Barshon. ""Sort of unwillingly, yet, I had to join a regular job, which I was not interested in at all."" Resigning from the job, he shifted to Dhaka to pursue his ultimate dream of becoming an actor.

While Wahid Tareq's ""Alganagar"" was supposed to be his debut film, the film was shelved due to some reasons. ""'Unoponchash Batash' and ""Chandraboti Kotha"" brought me appreciation, yet, my role in ""Kaiser"" was much more popular,"" asserts the actor. ""Every actor's ultimate goal is cinema—because it has a rich archival value, and through films we can reach to mass audiences. However, in this era of digitisation, things have changed and every medium has a shelf life.""

""Ora 7 Jon"" tells the tale of seven freedom fighters who runs an operation during the Liberation War of Bangladesh. ""We had to struggle getting good enough screens, as we all know that the Indian blockbuster film ""Pathaan"" was also likely to be released at the same time."" According to him, the hall owners were more interested in Pathaan, and Khijir Hayat Khan's ""Ora 7 Jon"" alongside Fakhrul Arefeen Khan's ""JK71"" faced tough competition. ""We really worked hard for our film, and watch all the efforts going in vain is really heartbreaking.""

Apart from acting, Barshon is also the member of the newly formed band, Halley'r Dhumketu. ""We have a few songs including a Tagore rendition, which were released under the banner of G-series. We are working on our original numbers, which we plan to release soon.""

As fans wait for ""Kaiser"" level 2, Barshon hinted that an announcement might come soon. He will be seen in the government granted film ""Japito Jibon"". He will also be seen in Deepto Play original project ""Apolaap"".",2023-03-04 10:48:42,https://www.thedailystar.net/showbiz/news/barshon-exudes-brilliance-3262776,2023-05-18 10:25:09,thedailystar
350,Not just a public figure,"Aisha Khan did not know that she would fall in love with dance, when she began in 2003 as a child artiste, upon her mother's will. In her formative years as a student of the dance department at Shishu Academy, she failed the initial term due to lack of interest in performing arts. Her mother did not stop insisting, and time gave her another chance, where she came out to be the topper in her dance class.

Aisha Khan

The multifaceted artiste started off her career once again, after a six-year break. ""As a child artiste I was not a renowned face, and that was an advantage for me, as to the audience I was a new face,"" shared Aisha, who began anchoring in 2017, and made her acting debut as an actress in 2020. ""I was featured in the short film ""Tomar Kachhei Jabo"", in one of the episodes of ""Kachhe Ashar Oshomapto Golpo"", which as a newcomer gave me unexpectedly positive responses from the audience.""

She was recently featured in Raka Noshin Nower's short film ""Ekta Tumi Lagbe"", which was one of the three films from the popular Valentine's Day campaign ""Ei Shomoyer Kachhe Ashar Golpo"". ""Last time, the story I was featured in was a sad story of separation, and I am glad that this time, I got the chance to actually finish my story,"" asserted the actress. One of the dialogues from the film -- I am not a public figure, but my figure is public -- said by Aisha, went viral on social media after its release.

""I believe that our audience is mature enough to know that an actor needs to do and say whatever is needed for the script to succeed,"" said Aisha. Personally, the actress was embarrassed to shoot the scene, where she had to wear a short-ish dress and dance in front of the camera. ""This part of the project was the toughest for me. I never wear sleeveless clothes, so when we were shooting for the scene, I told my director and designer that in case I get kicked out from my house, to keep a place for me in theirs.""

Growing up in the industry, Aisha was eventually enamoured with anchoring and working simultaneously on OTTs. Her debut was in the ZEE5 Global web project ""Contract"", sharing the screen with Arifin Shuvoo and Shamol Mawla. ""I always try to maintain variation in my works -- as an artiste, it satisfies me,"" she adds. ""This is why I want to continue anchoring and acting side by side."" Her appearance in ""E Emon Porichoy"", ""Daag"", and ""Café Desire"" indicate towards a promising career down the line.

Aisha Khan

For her silver screen debut, Aisha hopes to go into a different direction. ""I have always wanted to work in films which are made for festivals, because I feel those projects are done more carefully,"" she said. ""If I get an offer for such film, at this time in career, I would definitely take it up without giving a second thought.""

Aisha is greatly inspired from South Indian films. ""People who follow me on the social media, they know that I am an avid fan of South Indian films,"" added the actress as an interesting tidbit.",2023-02-25 04:01:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/showbiz/news/not-just-public-figure-3255576,2023-05-18 10:25:10,thedailystar
351,Stellar Sadia,"Sadia Nabila captivated audiences with her appearance in Sunny Sanwar's ""Mission Extreme"", and its sequel ""Black War"".

In recent times, the Australian expat has been gaining a lot of appreciation for portraying the role of a cop, called Ira, which gave her a new identity in the local film industry.

In conversation with The Daily Star, the actress spoke about the experience of working in multiple industries, her future plans and much more.

You made your silver screen debut with a Bollywood film. How did that come about?

In 2017, I participated in the pageant 'Miss India World Wide'. I was the first Bangladeshi contestant there. After the contest, Devesh Pratap Singh called me for an audition for his film, ""Pareshaan Parinda"". This is how I began my journey on the silver screen, by working in a Bollywood film.

Sadia Nabila

How did your journey in showbiz begin?

At the age of four, my parents admitted me to a dance academy, knowing that I was passionate towards performing arts. I am blessed that my parents have been encouraging me since my childhood.

What kind of feedback have you been receiving for your recent film, 'Black War'?

The feedback has been mostly positive. I have been amazed by the love the audience has been showering upon me. After getting such appreciation, it has raised their expectations from me. Now, it is my responsibility to not disappoint them. So, I will have to carefully select my future roles, so that I can raise or, at the very least, maintain the standard my fans are used to.

Sadia Nabila

Tell us about Ira's personality?

Ira is very close to my heart. She is a career driven woman who is focused on taking the best decisions for herself. She is rarely influenced by any social pressure. Personally, I feel I share a lot of similarities with her personality.

Would you say 'Black War' is better than 'Mission Extreme'?

To be honest, it is definitely better than the prequel. ""Mission Extreme"" was 15 percent of what the entire story reflects, while the ultimate experience is in ""Black War"".

Sadia Nabila

You have worked in the showbiz industries of three countries—Australia, India and Bangladesh. How did the experiences vary?

I am currently working with two agencies in Australia. Apart from modeling, I am also working there as an actress. My dreams has always been to work in Bengali films, and I am happy that the journey began in such a great way.

I don't like comparing the industries in different countries, as I believe that, despite all the struggles and limitations, everyone gives their 100 percent to bring their best to the table.

Which artiste inspires you the most?

There are many, however, if I have to mention a name, it would be Shah Rukh Khan. Watching him on the screen and learning about his personality off screen has been amazing. His humble nature is what I admire the most.

Having worked in Bollywood, do you wish to someday share the screen with SRK?

Who would not?! However, I don't know if I can hold my excitement after watching him.",2023-02-11 04:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/stellar-sadia-3243516,2023-05-18 10:25:12,thedailystar
352,Black War: Better than Mission Xtreme?,"Black War is the second instalment in the Mission Extreme series. The story takes off from where Mission Extreme ends. The film is made on even a larger scale, as the story extends to Dubai.

Arifin Shuvoo's transformation has already created a buzz in the e-biz world. Arifin Shuvoo, Sadia Nabila, Fazlur Rahman Babu, and Taskin Rahman give exceptional performances to make the movie a success.

As a movie, it is better than its prequel in every aspect. Black War, directed by Sunny Sanwar and Faisal Ahmed, was released on January 13, 2022.

353,"12 months, 5 films, one Shuvoo","Arifin Shuvoo often talks about his 'Made in Bangladesh' six-pack – and it is true that he has worked incredibly hard for his body transformation over the years, especially for ""Black War"", which was released yesterday.

The actor also has quite a few projects coming up in 2023, including ""Noor"", ""Unish Bish"" and ""Mujib: The Making of a Nation.""

We have a cup of (non-sugar) coffee with him to talk about his hopes for the year.

Tell us about your six-pack transformation. How difficult was it?

'Six pack' transformation is a wrong concept. A transformation doesn't necessarily mean that you have to build your body. You can change your body from one shape to another which is called 'transformation'. You have seen my six-pack transformation of ""Black War"" and ""Mission Extreme"", I had a radical transformation for ""Mujib: The Making of a Nation"", where I had to increase my body fat for my role. When I joined the project, I was about 84 kgs, but I had to increase my weight up to 98 kg gradually. I am 86 kg right now, as I have to be lean for two upcoming movies. These require a lot of hard work, as well as a rigid commitment.

Last year you didn't have a single movie released.

We couldn't release any movies last year due to delays in post-production. However, I have great news for my fans as I will be releasing 5 films in 12 months, which in itself is a huge deal.

Why do you think people will watch Black War?

People who love action movies and want to admire my 'made in Bangladesh six packs' will definitely come to the theatres.

Do you think you have gained the respect you deserve for your work in Dhallywood?

I work in movies because of my own satisfaction as an artiste, I don't wander around for industry recognition. I only care about whether my films have good scripts or if my characterisation is perfect or not. I don't want to be dependent on others to judge my work.

Is there any truth to rumours of you dating Black War's heroine, Oishee?

The industry loves to make up rumours about an actor's personal life. I know my truth, and so I don't need to add any verification to their claims.

Any message for your fans?

""Black War"" is an action film which will surely entertain you and make you smile. Meanwhile, we got great responses for it. Please don't compare our movies to Hollywood movies. We have tried our best and please do consider our limitations and watch the movie with a free mind.",2023-01-14 10:15:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/12-months-5-films-one-shuvoo-3218416,2023-05-18 10:25:14,thedailystar

Animes lives and breathes music, and is arguably the discovery of the year by none other than Shayan Chowdhury Arnob. His panache is unmatched, and his hunger grows as he churns out his compositions. Even though he can adapt to any stage, his videos where he plays his uke in scenic locations are his best representations.

With hit projects like ""Café Desire"", ""Daag"" and ""Kaiser"", young Aisha Khan made this year her own on OTTs this year. The actress looks to grow in the industry, where she is already prevalent as an anchor. She will soon be seen in ""Hrid Majhare"" on Deepto Play.",2022-12-31 12:36:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/promising-faces-showbiz-3209521,2023-05-18 10:25:16,thedailystar
355,In-between innings with Mou,"The FIFA World cup kept Mousumi Mou extremely busy, besides she was also had her hands full for the Cricket T20 world cup.

Although the anchor's favourite team, Brazil, could not even qualify after the quarter finals, she continued the smile on her face, and hosted the live show the next day discussing the faults of her favourite team.

Since you did more shows on cricket, are you also a football fan?

Before doing the shows for football this season, I was not. That being said, I was fond of football in my childhood.

Which would you choose between cricket and football?

I can't really choose between cricket and football, and to tell you the truth, I was well-versed on cricket, since I was doing cricket shows for a long time.

Do you think that football World cup had more craze in our country than cricket?

Of course. The football world cup comes after four years, but cricket is more readily available. Also, football is much easier to understand, it has rhythm, and takes less time to finish. Football is said to be the greatest show on earth for a reason. At one time, we had undying craze about our teams Abahani and Mohammedan, similar to the excitements we see now for Brazil and Argentina. We should not forget about our Shadhin Bangla Football team, how great they were! I still believe that someday our football team will reach a milestone.

What would you take as a profession, if not an anchor?

I wanted to become a doctor. Unfortunately, I was not able to make a seat for me in public medicals, and I did not want to study in private. Ultimately, I became an anchor, mime artiste and an actress.

What are your upcoming ventures?

During the world cup, I had to reject a lot of fictions and web projects. I have recently worked in a music video, featuring singer Kornia. The video story is mime based, and as a mime artiste, I enjoyed a lot working in this project. I will be hosting the upcoming BPL season, for two private channels.",2022-12-24 10:02:48,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/between-innings-mou-3203931,2023-05-18 10:25:17,thedailystar
356,Runa Khan reborn,"The audience discovered Runa Khan as Sumona, the much-loved character from the popular children's show, Sisimpur Bangladesh. The National Film Award winner recently went through a drastic change in look, due to her weight loss. Her latest work, Amitabh Reza Chowdhury's ""Bodh"", released yesterday.

""The journey was very long, hectic yet the results are evident.""

How was your experience of working in 'Bodh'?

""Bodh"" is very special to me. After a long time, I have worked with Amitabh Reza Chowdhury. Also, my co artistes in this project, including the likes of—Afzal Hossain, Syed Babu, Rawnak Hasan, Orchita Sporshia, and Khairul Basar—all of them are brilliant actors. Here, I have played the role of Dipti Rani, a school teacher. She is extremely sensitive and humane by nature. To know more about her, you have to watch 'Bodh'!



""OTT has raised expectations for the entire industry.""

Is the medium important to you, while choosing projects?

Not at all. Acting is all that matters to me. Be it stage, television, commercials, film or OTT—I always try to perform accordingly, and do my best.

You have been regularly working in the OTT. Since it is a new medium, and it has a lot to improve. What is your observation?

OTT has raised expectations for the entire industry. Compared to other mediums, we are getting more experimental works here. Budget is one of the biggest factors for a production, and in this medium, directors are getting firm budget so far. I believe with time, we can do a lot better.

""Love yourself, and the world will love you.""

Who is your inspiration in acting?

I grew up in the 90s, and at that time Shomi Kaiser, Afsana Mimi were the actresses who have mesmerized me with their charm. They have inspired me a lot to become an actress.

You have worked in a few numbers of films, and you have also received the National Film Award for ""Haldaa"" for Best Supporting Actress. Did you play your dream role yet?

Certainly not! I still dream to play such role which will remain in me forever, and the one which will keep me in the heart of the audience for a lifetime. Not all dreams come true, but at least I can hope for!

""Acting is all that matters to me. Be it stage, television, commercials, film or OTT—I always try to perform accordingly, and do my best.""

Do you believe the term 'supporting actor' or 'character artiste' is a justified title for an artiste?

Of course, it is not! Whoever is working in a production, is supporting the story. Based on the screen time, it should not be judged. Even the people who work behind the camera are playing a supporting role to present a complete work to the audience.

""I grew up in the 90s, and at that time Shomi Kaiser, Afsana Mimi. They have inspired me a lot to become an actress.""

What are your upcoming projects?

I have completed working in the government granted film, ""Ekti Na Bola Golpo"", directed by Pankaj Palit, which awaits release. I am also in Kaushik Sankar Das directorial web film ""Dafon""—it is a female centric plot where I will be playing the protagonist Kulsum. Another production is in the works for the new local OTT platform Ayna – web series ""Baghey Khay"", directed by Noman Robin.

Name three of your favourite directors.

Ashfaque Nipun, Amitabh Reza Chowdhury, and Tauquir Ahmed.

Name three of your favourite co-actors.

Jaya Ahsan, Chanchal Chowdhury and Mosharraf Karim.

Recently you have shed a lot of weight – you went from 105 kilos to 68 kilos. Would you like to share your journey with us?

The journey was very long, hectic yet the results are evident. I gained a lot of weight, and I was 105 kilos after my daughter Rajeshwari was born. When I returned to work after maternity leave, my weight was the main topic of talk in my work environment.

To be honest, this threw me into depression. To tell you the truth, except surgery, there is hardly anything I didn't try to lose those extra kilos.

""I still dream to play such role which will remain in me forever, and the one which will keep me in the heart of the audience for a lifetime.""

How did you finally succeed?

When I realised that my close ones were bullying me, I immediately cut off the toxic people from my life. That very moment I knew that I am regaining the energy to begin the journey of losing the extra weight. Throughout the journey, my husband Eshon Waheed and my daughter made sure that I don't feel lonely. I am also grateful to my friends, who stood beside me in my odds.

You had learned a lesson of life from your journey…what would you suggest to those who are still struggling to start living a healthy life?

Staying mentally well is very important, you will lose focus when you listen to toxic people. Love yourself, and the world will love you.",2022-11-05 04:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/showbiz/news/runa-khan-reborn-3160541,2023-05-18 10:25:18,thedailystar
357,"Winning over the audience, one smile at a time","Tanjim Saiyara Totini, with her potential, could be one of the busiest actresses of her time. However, she prefers being selective about her works. From her journey of ""Kolpona"" to ""Shuhashini"", her memorable smile leaves a mark on the audience's hearts.

The young actress, who is still a student of North South University, stands in front of The Daily Star's camera for an exclusive shoot.

Recently, you posted pictures when you travelled to India. How was your tour?

I went to Darjeeling with friends, during our semester break. It was an amazing tour. When we complete our graduation, we will be busier than ever. If we don't enjoy these moments with friends now, then when?

You will be seen on the silver screen very soon with the film ""Jaya Aar Sharmin"". What other projects did you work on?

I recently worked in Rubel Anush's ""Newmarket"", and puja special fiction ""Sharod Prate"" directed by Chayanika Chowdhury. I am receiving positive responses for both projects. As for ""Jaya Aar Sharmin"", I worked on this project before we shot ""Kolpona"", an episode from ""Ei Muhurte"". To me, the medium is irrelevant, I just want to learn at this stage of my career.

Within a small span of time, you have earned much love from the audience. Do you have any secrets to share?

Acceptance matters a lot, and I think I am fortunate enough that people have showered me with so much love within such a short time. Also, Aryan Bhai told me an interesting fact – my facial features are a personification of Bengal itself (giggles).

What are you currently busy with?

I am actually towards the end of my graduation, and at this time, I am trying to focus more on my education. Besides I am doing some photoshoots and in talks with some television projects. I have to think a lot before taking up any web project, because it needs concentration and time. After completing graduation, I will be able to take up more OTT projects.

Before appearing on Mizanur Rahman Aryan's ""Shuhashini""( girl with pretty smile), did your friends give you that title?

My friends started calling me 'Shuhashini' after the fiction was released.

Is it true that you agreed to do a small role in ""Taqdeer"", just because Chanchal Chowdhury will be playing the protagonist in it?

Yes, it is true, and honestly, working with the entire team (Film Noir) was a great experience. Working in the same project with Chanchal Chowdhury, who is my inspiration and sharing the screens with Manoj Pramanik is something I can brag about.

If you were to share one thing you like and one you dislike the most about yourself, what would it be?

People say that I am humble and kind. At the same time, I really like cats and dogs—This is one of those features which one should have, I believe.

One thing I do not like about myself is that at times, I feel extremely insecure, which I know I shouldn't and I should be more confident.

How do you manage the transition of getting in and out from one character to another?

It is really tough. I still remember after completing ""Kolpona"", I was struggling to get out of the shooting atmosphere and the character I portrayed. Even today, whenever I feel extremely low, I feel that character.",2022-10-15 09:15:57,https://www.thedailystar.net/showbiz/news/winning-over-the-audience-one-smile-time-3143316,2023-05-18 10:25:19,thedailystar
358,Celebrating Puja,"Colours, festivities and joy are all around for this year's Durga Puja, as one of the biggest holidays for the Bengali community starts today. Puja Chery, one of Dhallywood's fastest rising stars, is also excited for the festival. Her film ""Hridita"", a government-granted film, will be released on October 7.

What are your plans for this year's puja?

My plans for puja began a few days ago, when I visited Thailand to shoot a web-film. While I was there, I did a lot of shopping for puja.

I bought a salwar kameez for myself, sarees for my mother, and many clothes for my father and brother. That's why I am saying that puja has already started for me, as it always begins with shopping for your near and dear ones. Getting gifts for the people you love is what puja is all about.

Will you be staying in Dhaka or returning to your hometown of Khulna for this year's puja?

This time, I will be celebrating puja in Dhaka. On the day of Durga Puja, I will visit the many different puja mandaps present in our city. First and foremost, I will go to Dhakeshwari Temple to start off my puja, and then I will start visiting the other temples. That's how I plan to spend the entire day of puja. I think I will it will be a lot of fun and I am looking forward to it.

There is a deep connection between puja and love. Who is Puja Chery currently in love with?

I thoroughly enjoy the feeling of being in love. In some ways, I love being in love. Without love, people's lives are meaningless, I truly believe that.

However, suddenly I feel that love can make someone's life harder. It can distract them from being focused on their craft. So, my first priority is to focus on my career, and then pursue other things. So, currently Puja is not in love, but Puja does love celebrating puja.

So, how is life as loveless Puja?

I'm both in love and not. It's hard to explain this to others, but it is a mixed feeling. However, I can tell you for certain that I am not in love with anyone.

The government-granted film ""Hridita"" will be releasing this month. Why did you choose to act in this film?

The major reason behind me choosing to work on this film was the writer, Anisul Hoque. I have been a fan of his writing since my school days. When I heard that this film will be based on his novel, ""Hridita"", I was very excited to sign on for this project.

Why should people go to theatres to watch it?

Directed by Ispahani Arif Jahan, this is a movie that will have you holding your breath from start to finish. It's a movie that many will enjoy.

People who enjoy watching movies in a quiet environment, will really love this film. This is not the type of film for people who like dance routines and songs in their movies. When I finished dubbing for the film, I loved it very much.

A few days back, while you were shooting in Thailand, a picture of you kissing went viral on social media. Could you elaborate on it?

I went to Thailand to shoot a web-film called ""Pori"". The story of this film revolves around human trafficking, specifically around the story of women being trafficked.

In the film, I play the role of a bar-dancer, who was trafficked from Bangladesh and taken to Bangkok. The picture that went viral, is from this web-film.

How busy are you right now with your acting career?

I played the role of Sohana in the upcoming movie ""Masud Rana"". I've worked very hard to portray this character perfectly. In this film, I took part in the shooting without any stunt doubles, thereby risking my life. Apart from this, I also have completed the shooting for the film ""Nakful"".",2022-10-01 03:30:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/celebrating-puja-3131986,2023-05-18 10:25:21,thedailystar
359,What HBO’s ‘House of the Dragon’ promises to bring to the world of ‘A Song of Ice & Fire’,"""Fire and blood""—the ancient words of House Targaryen—quite literally ruled the fictional continent of Westeros, long before Ned Stark's much foretold 'winter' sank its icy jaws deep into the Seven Kingdoms. Inspired in parts by the ancient Roman, Egyptian, and Norman civilisations, House Targaryen in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire has been regarded as more mystical than the rest of the noble houses in the fictional world.

I'm sure I speak for all the fans of Martin's works when I say we simply do not acknowledge the existence of the trainwreck that was the 8th and final season of Game of Thrones. Considering how the show ended on such a heartbreakingly disappointing note, it begs the question of whether we ought to have trusted the same network with the responsibility of adapting fan-favourite characters from a beloved series of books for television.

However, the series dug itself into a grave in 2016 soon after its 6th season began airing mainly because showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss were running out of source material to work with. As Martin himself was still in the process of writing the final two books in the series, the showrunners opted to improvise, taking risks which never paid off.

The most notable difference between the source material for Game of Thrones and that of House of the Dragon (2022) is that the text for the latter isn't a work in progress, as the two final novels in A Song of Ice and Fire series are yet to be released. This difference will undoubtedly make for a very different watching experience. With the shocking finale of Game of Thrones' 5th season heavily mirroring Jon Snow's fate in the final chapters of A Dance With Dragons (2011), viewers were left scrambling for fan theories between the books and the forthcoming episodes. The viewers of House of the Dragon won't find themselves in a similar predicament as the events surrounding the second Targaryen Civil War have already been documented in full in Fire & Blood (2018).

The HBO season premiere of the prequel series has already earned glowing reviews from fans and critics alike, although certain unfavourable comparisons have already been made with the original. CNN dubbed the prequel as a ""less-addictive"" version of the original, while BBC regarded the new show as being heavily grounded in the philosophies of the world of Ice and Fire. Considering the extensive marketing strategies, with the launch of a promotional virtual reality app called 'DracARys', it is almost safe to assume that House of the Dragon is here to fill the hole left behind by the emotionally-distressing final season of Game of Thrones. The premiere episode of HoD, however, makes it clear that it doesn't intend to build a connection to the original series with plot holes and Easter eggs.

Video of House of the Dragon | Official Trailer | HBO Max House of the Dragon premiered on HBO Max on August 21, 2022.

House of the Dragon is its own show, expressing its uniqueness by presenting us with moments never seen before in the world of Ice and Fire on television: a crudely-conducted emergency C-section, full-grown dragons being outfitted with functional saddles, a king who expresses his love for his queen with sincerity, and the real Iron Throne as Aegon I the Conqueror had it forged. We're introduced to a different Westeros, a time when the warring houses of Lannister, Stark, and Baratheon dared not dream of occupying the Iron Throne, lest it invoke the wrath of the ruling dragonriders. A time before scheming spiders, venomous sand snakes, and tart-tongued queens of thorns.

Therefore, King's Landing over 130 years following Aegon I's conquest is a significantly prosperous one, with well-constructed streets and jousting arenas, although the city remained more or less the same in spirit as seen in the original series. What the show lacks in terms of diverse and colourful characters, it compensates for with its on-screen depiction of graphic violence. If you thought the combat between Oberyn Martell and Ser Gregor Clegane ended on a particularly gruesome note, you might want to brace yourself for the jousting sequences and watching the Gold Cloaks in action under Prince Daemon's command.

While I would've liked to see a more faithful and extensive adaptation of the Targaryen history on television—granted, only one episode has been released so far and more shows are in the pipeline—I do appreciate the efforts made by showrunners Ryan Condal, Miguel Sapochnik, and George RR Martin himself, to break new grounds of their own. The Targaryen history is set to be explored through better fleshed-out relationships between characters, which the audience can glimpse through the brief portrayal of King Viserys I and Queen Aemma's affections towards each other, and Princess Rhaenyra and Lady Alicent's friendly bond as each other's childhood companions. Wholesome scenes, such as Rhaenyra and Alicent studying together for an upcoming examination and the king and queen having a heart-to-heart over their shared grief, are welcome additions that aren't found in the original text, but do succeed in balancing out the blood and gore, and the trademark overwhelming sense of moral ambiguity that the world of Ice and Fire is known for.

Having read the book and watched the first episode of its television adaptation, I can confidently state that the history of House Targaryen is in good hands for now.

360,Fashion designer Paco Rabanne dies at 88,"French designer Paco Rabanne poses after his Spring-Summer ready-to-wear women's fashion collection for 2004 in Paris, October 11, 2003. File photo: Reuters

Paco Rabanne, the Spanish-born designer best known for his metallic ensembles and space age designs of the 1960s, has died at the age of 88.

The eponymous label he exited more than two decades ago hailed him as ""among the most seminal fashion figures of the 20th century"".

Rabanne dressed some of the most prominent stars of the 1960s, including French singer Francoise Hardy, whose outfits from the designer included a minidress made from gold plates and a metal link jumpsuit, as well as Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg, who were pictured in matching silver outfits.

Among his most famous looks were the fitted, skin-baring ensembles worn by Jane Fonda in Roger Vadim's cult science fiction film ""Barbarella"".

The death of Francisco Rabaneda y Cuervo, Paco Rabanne's birth name, was confirmed by a spokesperson for Spanish group Puig, which now controls the fashion house.

""A major personality in fashion, his was a daring, revolutionary and provocative vision, conveyed through a unique aesthetic,"" said Marc Puig, chairman and CEO of Puig.

Born in a village in the Spanish Basque region in 1934, his mother was a head seamstress at Balenciaga. He died in Portsall in Brittany.

Rabanne grew up in France, where the family moved after Spanish troops shot dead his father, who had been a Republican commander during the civil war.

He studied architecture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. He started his career sketching handbags for a supplier to prestigious fashion houses including Givenchy and Chanel, as well as shoes for Charles Jourdan.

He then branched into fashion, designing garments and jewellery with unconventional materials such as metal and plastic.

INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION

His first collection, which he described as ""unwearable dresses made of contemporary materials"" were pieces made of strips of plastic linked with metal rings, worn by barefoot models at a presentation at the upscale Paris hotel George V.

The Paris cabaret Crazy Horse Saloon was his next venue, where models paraded his skimpy dresses and bathing suits while wearing hardhats.

While his innovation and futuristic designs won plaudits, his fascination with the supernatural prompted public derision at times. He was known for recounting past reincarnations, and in 1999, he predicted the space station Mir would crash into France, coinciding with a solar eclipse.

Surrealist Salvador Dali famously approved of his compatriot, calling him ""Spain's second genius"".

The designer teamed up with Spain's Puig family in the late 1960s, launching perfumes that served as a springboard for the company's international expansion.

""Paco Rabanne made transgression magnetic. Who else could induce fashionable Parisian women (to) clamour for dresses made of plastic and metal,"" said Jose Manuel Albesa, president of Puig's beauty and fashion division.

The label has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years, under the creative direction of Julien Dossena, who has updated the house's signature chainmail designs.

""We are grateful to Monsieur Rabanne for establishing our avant-garde heritage and defining a future of limitless possibilities,"" the fashion house said in a statement.

The designer's work with metallic plastic gave a ""sharp edge"" to women's clothes, an effect that was ""so much more than a New Look"", fashion historian Suzy Menkes said on Instagram Friday.

""It was rather a revolutionary attitude for women who wanted both to protect and assert themselves.""",2023-02-03 19:26:34,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/fashion-designer-paco-rabanne-dies-88-3238571,2023-05-18 10:25:23,thedailystar
361,The Three Flavors Cornetto Trilogy is the golden standard for modern action-comedies,"Even after nine years, Edgar Wright's ""Three Flavors Cornetto Trilogy"" is one of the best works in the action-comedy genre. In a world where we get mildly funny Kevin Hart and The Rock movies with a lacklustre plot every year, the Cornetto trilogy stands out with a meaty script, memorable characters, and direction that transcends to auteurism.

The first movie, Shaun of the Dead, follows a classic zombie plot; the second one, Hot Fuzz, is a buddy cop movie; the third, The World's End, is an end-of-the-world sci-fi alien movie. The only thing linking these movies is neither the plot nor the underlying themes but random sequences with Cornettos of different flavours.

The colour of the Cornettos also works as a token of depiction for the three plots – the red one represents Shaun of the Dead, the blue represents Hot Fuzz, and the green one is The World's End, because aliens are supposed to be green.

The first time I saw Shaun of the Dead, I was caught off guard by its low-budget indie charm. It manages to be a comedy zombie movie that doesn't try to be too funny, has emotional moments here and there and finishes off in an unpredictable way.

Hot Fuzz, on the other hand, delivers one of the best buddy cop stories, beating genre clichés, and gifts us a wholesome cop duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.

Meanwhile, The World's End is basically a stoner movie that takes a hard sci-fi turn and presents its protagonists with ridiculous obstacles. The main character's struggles with growing up and his friendship with Frost's co-lead stay at the heart of all three movies.

What separates the Cornetto movies from their genre counterparts is that they don't take themselves too seriously. Their absurd plots don't linger on any more than it needs to. Also, the jokes are funny and have aged well. The script doesn't try to be overly funny and manages to not lose out on the underlying deeper stuff. The offbeat dialogues and eccentricity of the characters work well but don't pull back on character development. Unlike most of the Marvel movies these days that take a similar direction but end up being uninspired.

The films don't feel like a lot of funny things stitched together to make up for the lack of a real plot like most of the stuff these days. The emotional scenes work out. And you get a film that doesn't suffer from the passage of time like many of these similar (read: every The Rock movie) movies do.

The decision to make the movies an anthology works well too. Tying the plots together might have made the movies unforgettable or mediocre.

The success of the Cornetto trilogy ended up making Edgar Wright a modern powerhouse. Close pan shots, characters taking long intervals between sentences, sublime soundtrack, and the cheap plastic tint he gives to his films carries on well and makes them stand out. These are all signature Edgar Wright quirks that he went on to perfect in his newer films, making him an auteur, and we don't get this type of film usually made by auteurs.

Unlike most of the comedy action movies these days that wander into obsolescence after a year or two, the Cornetto Trilogy is worth a rewatch for years to come.

362,"Amber Heard's attorneys claim juror served improperly, seek mistrial","Actor Johnny Depp and his former wife Amber Heard are seen in this photo taken during trial of Depp's defamation suit against Heard at Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia, USA. Photo: AP

One of the jurors in the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial served improperly, an attorney for Heard alleged in a recent filing that asked the court to declare a mistrial and order a new trial.

""Newly discovered facts"" show Juror No. 15 in the six-week trial was not the individual summoned in April to serve in the case, Heard's attorney wrote in a five-page memo filed Friday in Virginia's Fairfax Circuit Court.

Instead, the filing suggests Juror No. 15 was a younger individual with the same last name who ""apparently"" lives at the same address.

""As the Court no doubt agrees, it is deeply troubling for an individual not summoned for jury duty nonetheless to appear for jury duty and serve on a jury, especially in a case such as this,"" the filing said.

Depp sued his ex-wife over a December 2018 op-ed Heard wrote in The Washington Post describing herself as ""a public figure representing domestic abuse."" Much of the testimony focused on whether Heard had been physically and sexually abused, as she claimed. Depp said he never hit Heard and that she was the abuser.

After a televised trial that turned into a spectacle, the jury found in Depp's favor on all three of his claims relating to specific statements in the 2018 piece.

The jury decided Depp should receive $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages, but the judge reduced the punitive damages award to $350,000 under a state cap.

Heard has previously said she plans to appeal the verdict.

News of Friday's filing was first reported by Deadline, which posted the document online.

The memo expanded upon earlier post-trial motions filed by Heard's legal team that asked the judge to throw out the verdict against her. Those motions had raised the possibility that one of the jurors may not have been properly vetted by the court.

The latest filing said a ""jury panel list"" in the case included a person who would have been 77 at the time of the trial. Voter registration information lists two individuals with the same last name ""apparently"" residing at the same address, said the filing, in which the names were redacted.

""The individual who appeared for jury duty with this name was obviously the younger one. Thus, the 52-year-old ... sitting on the jury for six weeks was never summoned for jury duty on April 11,"" violating Heard's due process rights, the filing said.

The Associated Press sent emails seeking comment Sunday to a representative for Depp and two of his attorneys.",2022-07-11 09:17:30,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/amber-heards-attorneys-claim-juror-served-improperly-seek-mistrial-3068291,2023-05-18 10:25:26,thedailystar
363,Afran Nisho’s time is now,"After landing only two tele-productions last Eid ul-Fitr, Afran Nisho is back in full swing this season with rom-coms, thrillers and mysteries.

Alongside his much-awaited web projects ""Kaiser"" and ""Syndicate"", the actor will also appear in the Vicky Zahed directorial tele-fiction ""Bachibar Holo Tar Shaadh"", among many other single episodes, including ""Chakri Noy Chakor"" and ""Hot Temper"".

We caught up with Nisho to know more about this experience, with ""Kaiser"" and ""Syndicate"" and his other Eid special releases.

How did you become 'Kaiser'?

Being an 80's kid, I have a knack for detective stories, and I always wanted to play a role like Kaiser on screen. Kaiser does not fit into the usual mould that we expect in a detective. He is a very ordinary person, who has his own personal struggles to deal with. He is short-tempered and has trust issues. He also is a video-game addict. However, he is witty and is very good at his job.

Is it a full-on detective story like Byomkesh, Sherlock Holmes or Feluda?

""Kaiser"" won't come just as a detective story to the audience. There is more to the central titular character other than just solving a murder case. Holding on to Kaiser's internal conflicts while keeping up with the pace of his intelligence is the beauty of this role and was the most challenging part for me as an actor.

This production also gave me the opportunity to work with a team that I had not worked before with. This is also the first time I collaborated with Hoichoi and overall experience was quite intriguing!

Your production ""Syndicate"" also has elements of suspense, thrill, and mystery. How was your experience with it?

My character, Adnan, suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism which makes it difficult for him to be romantically involved with anyone.

364,Afran Nisho’s time is now,"After landing only two tele-productions last Eid ul-Fitr, Afran Nisho is back in full swing this season with rom-coms, thrillers and mysteries.

Alongside his much-awaited web projects ""Kaiser"" and ""Syndicate"", the actor will also appear in the Vicky Zahed directorial tele-fiction ""Bachibar Holo Tar Shaadh"", among many other single episodes, including ""Chakri Noy Chakor"" and ""Hot Temper"".

We caught up with Nisho to know more about this experience, with ""Kaiser"" and ""Syndicate"" and his other Eid special releases

How did you become 'Kaiser'?

Being an 80's kid, I have a knack for detective stories, and I always wanted to play a role like Kaiser on screen. Kaiser does not fit into the usual mould that we expect in a detective. He is a very ordinary person, who has his own personal struggles to deal with. He is short-tempered and has trust issues. He also is a video-game addict. However, he is witty and is very good at his job.

Is it a full-on detective story like Byomkesh, Sherlock Holmes or Feluda?

""Kaiser"" won't come just as a detective story to the audience. There is more to the central titular character other than just solving a murder case. Holding on to Kaiser's internal conflicts while keeping up with the pace of his intelligence is the beauty of this role and was the most challenging part for me as an actor.

This production also gave me the opportunity to work with a team that I had not worked before with. This is also the first time I collaborated with Hoichoi and overall experience was quite intriguing!

Your production ""Syndicate"" also has elements of suspense, thrill, and mystery. How was your experience with it?

My character, Adnan, suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism which makes it difficult for him to be romantically involved with anyone. He often finds himself deeply invested in a single thought and his world revolves around that thought, ignorant of the externalities that might end up crossing his path.

However, the trailer of this production has given way to a lot of queries among the audience. Is it a love story, a bank theft or a simple mystery—these questions will only be answered when they watch ""Syndicate"" on Chorki this Eid.

370,Climate resilience through local empowerment,"Insights from the Local Government Initiative on Climate Change (LoGIC) Project

Rikta Roy knows firsthand the devastating effects of climate change on coastal communities. Living in Dacope, one of the worst climate-affected areas in Bangladesh, she has experienced increased storms, cyclones, and salinity levels that have disrupted her livelihood over the years. Despite starting a small poultry farm with hopes of generating income, Rikta's dreams were shattered by Cyclone Amphan in May 2020, which swept away the farm.

Coastal women like Rikta are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change, often falling into a vicious cycle of poverty and vulnerability. The Local Government Initiative on Climate Change (LoGIC) project stepped in to break this cycle. Through the project, most climate-vulnerable women in Dacope Upazila, including Rikta, were given direct financial support to undertake climate adaptive livelihoods. With this fund, Rikta and her fellow climate-vulnerable women have been able to invest in watermelon cultivation, which now not only generates income but also serves as a beacon of hope for their future.

The satisfied smile of a CRF beneficiary reflects the successful outcome of her diligent efforts.

Throughout the process, the LoGIC project provided comprehensive support to these women, covering everything from planning and financing to developing climate-adaptive business models, leasing land, providing training on watermelon cultivation, creating access to financial institutions, and ultimately establishing market linkages to ensure that they receive fair value for their produce.

The LoGIC is a multi-donor collaborative initiative of Bangladesh Government, UNDP, UNCDF, EU and Sweden. Its primary aim is to empower and equip vulnerable communities, civil society organisations (CSOs), and Local Government Institutions (LGIs) to plan and finance sustainable climate change adaptation solutions in areas most affected by climate change. The Local Government Division (LGD) is the leading implementing partner for the project, working closely with UNDP and UNCDF.

""Besides the primary goal to reduce climate change impacts, the LoGIC project aims to eradicate the adaptation gap. Most of the efforts taken so far to address the impacts of climate change have been coping mechanisms, but adaptation strives for long-term resilience building through various actions,"" says A K M Azad Rahman, Project Coordinator, LoGIC project, UNDP.

Since July 2017, this project has been implemented in seven severely climate-vulnerable districts in Bangladesh- Khulna, Sunamganj, Kurigram, Bagerhat, Barguna, Patuakhali and Bhola. The 6-year-long LoGIC project is designed to support the most climate-vulnerable people through two financing schemes -- Community Resilience Fund (CRF) and Performance Based Climate Resilience Grants (PBCRG).

""While CRF is dedicated to support women for building climate adaptive livelihoods, PBCRG is used by the Union Parishads for building climate adaptive infrastructure,"" shares Jesmul Hasan, Country Focal, UNCDF Bangladesh.

The watermelon cultivation initiative received funding under the Community Resilience Fund (CRF) scheme of the LoGIC project. Other 23 types of successful climate adaptive livelihood options (CALOs) covered under the scheme include vermicomposting, integrated farming, duck rearing, fish polyculture and climate-resilient sheep rearing. To date, the LoGIC project has supported 35,000 climate-vulnerable women, and the number of beneficiaries is expected to increase in the future.

The initiatives funded under the Performance Based Climate Resilience Grants (PBCRG) scheme of LoGIC have also brought about many life-changing stories.

In the coastal Bagerhat District's Morelganj Upazila, for example, the residents of Nishanbari Union were grappling with increased salinity intrusion in the area, leading to a shortage of drinking water. Recognising the severity of the crisis, the Union Parishad, with support from the LoGIC project, established an integrated water management plant to ensure safe drinking water for the saline-stricken community.

""This is the only water treatment plant in the community that provides pure drinking water to the 500 families who have been suffering for the last two decades. We were closely involved in this initiative and provided voluntary support during its implementation,"" says Fozila Begaum, a resident of Nishanbari Union.

LoGIC supported 72 Union Parishads with PBCRG to implement 639 climate-resilient community level schemes which benefitted 898,449 people. The PBCRG schemes include climate resilient water and sanitation facility, solar-powered irrigation system, providing safety equipment to sea-going fishing boats, lightning/flood shelter, improved accessibility to cyclone shelters, vetiver & mangrove plantation and establishing community clinics and market sheds.

What sets the LoGIC project apart from other climate responses in Bangladesh is its Locally-led Adaptations (LLA) approach. Globally recognised as the most effective adaptation approach, LLA leverages local knowledge, ensures community participation, and empowers them to take ownership of the development initiative.

Investing in locally-led climate change adaptation projects can make a significant difference in vulnerable countries like Bangladesh, as demonstrated by the promising results of the LoGIC project. It has provided safety measures, strengthened climate adaptive infrastructure, and created livelihood opportunities. The real challenge now is to scale up the project.

According to A K M Azad Rahman, the project coordinator for LoGIC, the project will be tested in the Chittagong Hill Tracts for the next two years with the aim of expanding it to the national level.

371,Invest in the future by focusing on education,"Despite being small in terms of geography, Bangladesh currently ranks 8th in terms of population. Additionally, it is currently experiencing a demographic dividend, with 65.6% of its population being of working age. In order to turn this large population into a valuable resource, Bangladesh must invest in its people, and one essential way to do that is through providing proper education. This aligns with the theme of this year's International Education Day, ""Invest in People, Prioritize Education""

Current scenario

Bangladesh has made significant strides in increasing access to primary education in recent years. The Annual Primary School Census 2021 reports that nearly 98% of primary-school-aged children are enrolled in school, indicating near-universal access to primary education. Additionally, Bangladesh has achieved gender parity in primary and secondary schools, with 49.5% of girls enrolled in primary and 54.92% in secondary schools.

While the progress in primary education is commendable, the trend of students dropping out at secondary and tertiary levels is a significant concern. The prolonged school closures caused by the pandemic have exacerbated this issue. According to the Bangladesh Education Statistics 2021 report, there was a 6% decrease in secondary school completion rates for girls and a corresponding increase in dropout rates from 2020 to 2021. One major factor contributing to this trend is early marriages, which have become more prevalent as households have faced financial difficulties during the pandemic.

Additionally, a report by the University Grants Commission indicates that 2.49 lakh university students have dropped out between 2020 and 2021. The lack of attention from the government to revamp the education sector is also concerning. As per the budget for the fiscal year 2022-23, only 1.83% of the country's GDP is allocated for education, which falls short of the recommended minimum of 2% according to Prof. Serajul Islam Choudhury. He also points out that the budget that is allocated is not being implemented properly.

Quality of education

Bangladesh boasts a literacy rate of 74.91%, but a report by UNICEF (2022) shows that only 34% of third graders in the country can read proficiently, and only 18% can do basic math. The prolonged school closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have greatly impacted these young learners' foundations. However, it is important to note that the education challenges faced by children in Bangladesh predate the pandemic.

Bangladesh is on the brink of the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR), which calls for its citizens to possess a diverse set of skills, including digital literacy, ICT knowledge, emotional intelligence, analytical thinking, etc. to be able to compete in the global economy. To fully participate in this revolution, the country must re-evaluate its education system and ensure that it meets the demands of the 4IR.

Private universities have played a crucial role in producing graduates with the necessary skills and competencies. However, recent complaints have emerged that these institutions have become mere degree-issuing machines. Graduates are facing difficulty in getting employed and employers are expressing their dissatisfaction with the lack of suitably skilled candidates.

Dr. Md. Anwarul Kabir, Vice Chancellor of the State University of Bangladesh, emphasizes the importance of improving the quality of education in the country. He suggests investing more in labs, research, and quality textbooks in all universities in order to reach the level of success of countries like South Korea. He also points out that a well-educated population is essential for achieving the goal of a developed Bangladesh by 2041, and that failure to provide quality education will hinder progress.

The quality of education is closely tied to the quality of the learning environment. Public universities have traditionally been a source of well-educated individuals, but due to factors such as politicization, haphazard expansion, and inadequate facilities, the standard of these environments has declined.

The Vice Chancellor of the University of Dhaka, Professor Dr. Md. Akhtaruzzaman, notes that the situation has improved significantly from what it was 20 to 25 years ago. He acknowledges that it is a continuous effort to improve education and that the country is still catching up with technological advancements. However, he expresses optimism that in 10 years, the country will reach its desired destination.

Next steps

Education is considered to be the great equaliser, yet in Bangladesh, the three streams of education (English medium, Bangla medium, and Madrassa) are a significant weakness in the education system. According to Prof. Serajul Islam Choudhury, these streams are widening and deepening class divisions and undermining national unity.

He also highlights that quality education is impossible without dedicated and talented teachers. He suggest that teachers be given proper allowances and the respect they deserve in society and government should create a sustainable and promising career path for them.

In conclusion, the development of Bangladesh is heavily dependent on its ability to tap into the potential of its population and turn them into valuable human resources, which can only be achieved through quality education. Therefore, investing in education is the key to investing in people, and ultimately, prosperity.

372,Celebrating women transforming aquaculture in Bangladesh,"Today is the International Day of Rural Women, which offers us an opportunity to highlight the contributions of women and girls towards our rural development and aquaculture. On this occasion, The Daily Star, in partnership with WorldFish, is celebrating the achievements of six women fish farmers who have been working as local service providers (LSPs) in four northern districts of Bangladesh: Rangpur, Naogaon, Bogura and Gaibandha. The LSP model has been implemented under WorldFish's Aquaculture: Increasing Income, Diversifying Diets, and Empowering Women (IDEA) Project.

Romisa Khatun, Bogura

""Ten years ago, when I started farming fish in a small pond taken on lease, villagers used to criticise me saying that how can a woman be a fish farmer. They discouraged me from joining a 'man's profession',"" said Romisa Khatun of Kapura Purbapara village under Bogura's Sherpur upazila.

Currently, she is farming fish in ponds on more than 22 bighas of land.

""I am now a full-time fish farmer,"" she added.

Romisa and her husband now make an annual profit of Tk 6 lakhs from the business, and recently purchased another 5 bighas of land worth Tk 60-70 lakh with their earnings.

For her success, Romisa received the ""Best Aquaculture Farmers"" award from the Department of Fisheries this year.

In 2021, Romisa was selected as a Local Service Provider (LSP) under WorldFish's IDEA project. She then underwent a four-day training on modern techniques of fish farming.

""I learned about various aspects of pond fish farming, such as how to grow zooplankton (fish feed), how and when to use lime, and how to detect fish disease and take remedy measures,"" she said.

Besides operating her fish farm, Romisa is now providing training and advice to local women involved in aquaculture. One such beneficiary is Farzana Begum, who has been farming fish in her two-bigha pond for the last 10 years.

""Earlier, I was not aware of modern ways of fish farming but I learnt a lot about it from Romisa. Now, I make a profit of more than Tk 70,000 annually,"" Farzana said.

Amina Khatun, Bogura

Amina Khatun graduated from a local college in Bogura in 2005 and then went to Dhaka to get a job and support her family but could not earn much from tutoring in a kindergarten school.

Amina returned home in 2010 and started farming fish in a 20-decimal pond. After that, she started earning a profit of Tk 50,000 annually by selling fish fry. Now, Amina cultivates fish in five ponds and makes a profit of more than Tk 2.5 lakh per year.

Amina was selected as an LSP and received training under the IDEA project, and now works as an LSP in her locality.

""I have learned so many things in the LSP training. Now, I know how to preserve the pond bank, how to stock the fry and fingerling, and how to cultivate vegetables on the pond bank,"" she said, adding that she has already trained 10 male and 15 female entrepreneurs on the business.

Samim Hossain, a local fish farmer, said he started farming fish when he was young but could not make much profit until he learned modern aquaculture techniques from Amina.

This year, Amina received the ""Best Aquaculture Farmers"" award from the Department of Fisheries on the occasion of National Fish Week.

Nazmina Begum, Naogaon

""I was at a loss after the death of my husband in 2012 as I had two young children to raise,"" said Nazmina Begum from Kasba village of Naogaon's Barshail union.

""Our family used to cultivate paddy on our 165-decimal plot but it was quite impossible for me to look after that. So, I opted for fish farming,"" added Nazmina, who won the ""Best Aquaculture Farmers"" award from the Department of Fisheries this year.

Nazmina started farming fish in 2014 in her family pond. She used to take advice from local fish farmers to improve her production but could not attain much success.

In 2021, she was selected as an LSP under the IDEA project and received a four-day training on fish farming management practices and nutrition. In addition, she was taught about gender equality.

The programme also taught her how to increase profits by farming in an integrated manner, secure loans, and market fish.

Nazmina then expanded her farming activities and even planted banana and mango trees around the ponds that were once unused.

""Now, I produce high-quality carp fry by hatching eggs. Keeping some for myself, I sell them to other farmers,"" she said.

Local fish farmer Chanchol Ali informed that many farmers like him are getting quality carps and learning marketing policies from Nazmina.

Fenci Akter, Naogaon

""I started fish farming in 2014 to improve the income status of my family. I used to take advice from local fish farmers but didn't get much success. However, I didn't leave it,"" said Fenci Akter, a fish farmer from Barshail village of Naogaon Sadar upzila.

In 2021, Fenci participated in a four-day training programme under the IDEA project and became an LSP.

""I learnt about integrated fish farming methods, accessing loans from banks and the marketing process of fish produce,"" added Fenci, who was also taught about nutrition and gender issues through the training programme.

Fenci then said she initially only used to cultivate breeds of carp but now raises various small species as well.

""I am making good profit from my small investment,"" she said.

Fenci is now leading a team of 25 women and spreading her knowledge among local fish farmers. Other than imparting knowledge about modern fish farming techniques, she also informs people about how to ensure proper nutrition.

Kohinur Begum, a fish farmer of the same area, said she used to farm fishes in a one-bigha pond to meet her family demands. Inspired by the success of Fenci, she is now cultivating fish commercially and making good profit.

Fenci taught her how to cultivate healthy fry, what types of food and medicines should be used, and how to market fish produce.

Shilpi Begum, Gaibandha

Sompa Akter, who is currently doing her masters in economics at Rangpur Carmichael College, is a young fish farmer.

Sompa, a resident of Monohorpur village in Gaibandha, started fish farming one year ago after failing to secure a job following her undergraduate degree.

Sompa said she got training on fish farming from a neighbouring woman named Shilpi Begum and now earns around Tk 50,000 annually from her just 30-decimal pond.

Shilpi started fish farming around five years ago in a small pond without getting any training.

Later in 2020, she received four days of training. Now, she cultivates fish in five ponds and makes a profit of more than Tk 2 lakh each year.

""I learned so many things from the LSP training. It increased my skill on how to prepare the pond before farming fish, how to select the proper fry, how to stock it, and how to rear the fish properly,"" Shilpi said.

""As I am working as a LSP, I provide training to women entrepreneurs who are interested in fish farming. I have also disseminated information on gender equality and nutrition,"" she added.

This year, Shilpi received the ""Best Aquaculture Farmers"" award from the Department of Fisheries for her outstanding contribution.

Ambia Begum, Rangpur

In rural areas, there is a common perception that large water hyacinths are a good source of fish feed, but that is not true.

""Only small size water hyacinths are suitable for fishes,"" said Ambia Begum, a fish farmer from Khord-Bhutchhara village under Rangpur's Kaunia upazila. She has been helping local fish farmers improve their fish production by teaching them modern farming techniques.

Ambia went on to say that she always wanted to be a fish farmer and finally in 2016, she was able to start her farm in a 25-decimal pond.

However, she initially failed to make much progress due to a lack of knowledge on aquaculture.

""But in 2021, I was selected as an LSP, and it was a game-changer for me,"" Ambia said.

""I learnt about various aspects of fish farming, including fish feed, aquaculture product use and product safety. We also got some training on financial management and marketing our produce."" she added.

Ambia, who received a ""Best Aquaculture Farmers"" award from the Department of Fisheries this year, is now leading a team comprising 64 members and spreading her knowledge of modern fish farming among local farmers and also sells fish feed.

373,Prioritise hygiene in light of coronavirus pandemic,"Md Sagor, 27, a bus conductor, has to go to work every day amid the COVID-19 pandemic to sustain his family of four people. Although at the beginning of the pandemic he was more aware and taking precautionary steps such as wearing a mask, washing and disinfecting his hands and feet regularly, with the passage of time, this awareness has only declined due to ""pandemic fatigue"", which occurs when people get tired of the pandemic measures and become less likely to follow precautionary hygiene practices.

Sagor adds, ""It is annoying to prepare the disinfectant spray every day. Besides, as I have to stay outside the whole day and come into contact with a large number of commuters, it is extremely difficult to maintain maximum cleanliness all the time.""

Tahmina Akter, a private service holder and a regular commuter by public transport, expressed a similar concern. ""Many of us have been unable to maintain adequate precautions since normal operations have resumed after the shutdown without much precautionary measures in place,"" says Tahmina.

There are hardly any handwashing and hygiene facilities in crowded areas such as bus stops, markets and shopping malls, she adds.

Although investment in hygiene is a crucial factor in the fight against COVID-19, less than five percent of the total WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) budget in FY2020-21 has been allocated to the hygiene subsector. The overall budgetary allocation for the WASH sector is also far less than adequate.

A study titled ""WASH budget scenario in proposed National Budget FY 2020-21"" jointly produced by PPRC, WaterAid and UNICEF, published on June 28, shows that despite the upward trend over the last decade in WASH allocation, the sector has not been able to attract sufficient attention and remains at the bottom in terms of allocation, when compared with the growth of GDP and development budget.

There is also huge spatial inequality between the urban and rural areas in terms of WASH allocation. In a five-year period, 2016-17 to 2020-2021, there has been almost no change in the share of urban (80-83 percent) and rural (17-20 percent) WASH allocation, points out the study.

The study further reveals that among the WASH subsectors, hygiene remains the most neglected one.

Hossain Zillur Rahman, executive chairman of PPRC, says that in the proposed Budget, the hygiene agenda suffers both from lack of resources and the identification of specific activities. Terming the hygiene budget in both health and WASH sector as ""extremely inadequate"", he stresses on identifying the hygiene activities first.

""Bangladesh now needs to develop a hygiene agenda, in terms of specific activities, covering services and awareness programmes. For example, installing handwashing stations in slums is one idea but the hygiene agenda as a whole needs to be detailed out,"" he urges.

Hasin Jahan, country director of WaterAid, shares that there is no proper physical intervention related to hygiene as well as no national level campaign, through which life-saving messages of maintaining hygiene can be reminded repeatedly to public by the government.

""In the beginning, although everyone took issues of hand and respiratory hygiene seriously, over time, the importance is declining both at the people's and government's end,"" adds Jahan.

The PPRC-WaterAid-UNICEF study recommends prioritising hygiene as a vital tool of public health and epidemic preparedness; investing in large-scale nationwide hygiene campaigns; and installation of handwashing points with soap and water in public places, markets and bus stops.

Another significant aspect to consider is that although the educational institutions have been closed since March 17, the government must undertake measures to ensure adequate hygiene practices before reopening them.

According to Md Monirul Alam, WASH specialist, UNICEF, it will be challenging for the government to reopen the educational institutions with the current inadequate resources, since most schools have only one basin or tube well and the supplies of soap are inadequate.

""In accordance with the global guideline provided by World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF, every student must wash their hands with soap before entering the schools, and there must be proper handwashing facilities so that they can wash their hands multiple times during school hours. The educational institutions must also impart hygiene education to develop healthy behaviours among students,"" he adds.

With no vaccine in sight and countries globally grappling with a second or third wave of pandemic, a country like Bangladesh can stay safe by maintaining hygiene at all levels.",2020-08-31 18:00:00,https://thedailystar.net/supplements/news/prioritise-hygiene-light-coronavirus-pandemic-1953873,2023-05-18 10:25:47,thedailystar
374,B-SkillFUL: Shaping the Labour Market and Promoting Skills Development,"In 2017, the World Economic Forum featured an article claiming Bangladesh to be the ""New Asian Tiger"" which captured the attention of researchers, policymakers, economists, development workers, and the government. The article mostly relied on the trend and forecast of several economic and development indicators, such as the persistent GDP growth rate (over 6 percent, for more than a decade), political stability, steady macroeconomic performance, and geopolitical support. However, the article also indicated that the non-diverse export market, weak labour market, lack of employment opportunities, and the absence of skilled workers are major barriers in Bangladesh's journey to become a developed country.

According to the Labour Force Survey 2016-17, the country has a working-age population comprising of a staggering 109.1 million, of which only 60.8 million are employed. Among the remaining working-age population of 48.3 million, 45.6 million are unemployed and discouraged workers, where discouraged workers refer to those who are not even looking for any job opportunities. This sub-population is a matter of rising concern for Bangladesh. In addition, despite there being 20.1 million young individuals in the labour force, more than 12 million are ""Not in Education, Employment, and Training (NEET)"" and another 8 million are discouraged.

Unemployment is one of the major reasons behind poverty in Bangladesh. According to the latest Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2016, Bangladesh's upper poverty line has been recorded at 24.3 percent and the lower poverty line (or people living in extreme poverty) was recorded at 12.9 percent. Several studies show that unemployment, lack of decent jobs and limited scope for employment have induced the rise in poverty in Bangladesh.

There is a clear mismatch between the growth in labour force and associated sectors. An analysis of the last two labour force surveys shows that between 2013 and 2016-17, jobs in agriculture sector had declined by 1.1 percent annually against the sector output growth of 3.2 percent. In comparison to that, jobs in the industries sector grew by only 0.5 percent while the sector output growth was at a robust 9.8 percent. Additionally, jobs in the services sector grew by approximately 4 percent against output growth of around 6 percent. These scenarios clearly exhibit the weak growth in jobs with respect to the growth of outputs in the sectors, and the ""growth elasticity"" (change in the growth rates of jobs with respect to the change in growth rates of the GDP) suggests that jobs are showing an overall declining trend in comparison to the national growth of the country.

Furthermore, there is also a mismatch in the required skills to perform optimally amid the new technological waves in industries. Although data on skills mismatch in Bangladesh are limited, one important source of information, a tracer study conducted by The World Bank (2007), provides statistical evidence indicating that the skills imparted by much of the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) system are not what the market requires. The study suggests that 47 percent of graduates from formal TVET programmes report being unemployed when surveyed even two years after their graduation. There are significant pieces of evidence in academic and policy research studies that show that skills and education do not reflect the demand of the job market in the economies of developing countries and Bangladesh is no different. In an era of technological revolution, such as Artificial Intelligence, the nature of jobs is increasingly becoming high-tech and service-oriented and is focused on participation of skilled labour force in the workplace (Bresnahan et al., 2002).

With the vision to reduce the skills mismatch in the labour market and eradicate poverty through generating employment, Swisscontact Bangladesh has been implementing a project titled ""Building Skills for Unemployed and Underemployed Labour (B-SkillFUL)"" since November 2015. With assistance from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the European Union (EU), in the last four years, B-SkillFUL has provided training to nearly 40,000 poor and disadvantaged men and women in almost 18 different occupations. All these occupations have been selected through demand and skills forecasting disaggregated by regions, industries, and sex of the beneficiaries. Thus, the skills training provision of B-SkillFUL and selection of occupations represent the demand of the industries including manufacturing firms such as ready-made garments, light engineering, handicrafts, and many more. The project also supports trainees to gain employment with a minimum salary of BDT 5,000 in the form of both self and wage employment. The project has been implemented in six districts across Bangladesh, where people living under and/or near poverty thresholds are relatively higher. To be considered a potential beneficiary of B-SkillFUL through skills training, an individual is required to fulfil the criteria of the poverty threshold (upper poverty line of income of USD 2.5 per day, according to World Bank) and be disadvantageous in socioeconomic aspects.

B-SkillFUL's key focus has been to develop a labour force in the informal sector. Over 85 percent of Bangladesh's labour force are working in the informal economy, which is not regulated by welfare, social security, unemployment benefits, labour rights, and other labour market institutions such as minimum wage. B-SkillFUL has facilitated the training provision of trainees through private training schools or training provision centres. With B-SkillFUL's support these schools have also organised apprenticeships or on-the-job training known as Workplace-Based Training. Additionally, the project has sensitised over 3,000 informal small and medium enterprises (SMEs) on labour rights and decent work issues. B-SkillFUL has worked in partnership with Informal Sector Industry Skills Council, Bangladesh Women Chamber of Commerce & Industries (BWCCI) and National Association of Small Cottage and Industries of Bangladesh (NASCIB). These partners have provided the labour rights training to informal enterprises and followed up on their progress. The partners have put significant efforts into this collaboration as they have the same targets and mandates to achieve as part of their mission with the Government of Bangladesh.

In alignment with the demand for skilled workers in the industries and the future of work in the labour market of Bangladesh, B-SkillFUL has focused on bolstering employment scope for women in atypical jobs. These jobs include occupations such as mobile phone servicing technicians and electricians. The project has also organised apprenticeship programmes for trainees to provide them with real-time industry exposure. More than 50 percent of the students trained under the project are female; and of the total B-SkillFUL female graduates, more than 30,000 have been employed. To boost the female beneficiaries' enrolment and retention, the project has also explored innovative ideas, i.e. introducing female hygiene products, separate washrooms at training centres, and providing counselling to the guardians of the female beneficiaries.

From the experience of working with the training centres and their job placement offices, B-SkillFUL has observed that the centres alone cannot ensure sustainability in the employment of trainees. There is a need for an additional buy-in of the enterprises and that is why building and maintaining regular relationships with the enterprise employers are key factors in assuring sustainable employment. There should be measures in building and maintaining relationships with these employers, sensitising and encouraging them to improve enterprise productivity by investing in skills development initiatives and improving the technical capacity of the labour force in their workplaces. Nevertheless, as these small businesses lack capacity to create decent workplaces, despite their positive awareness about it, they will require technical assistance and financial support to convert this awareness into action.

Considering the recent coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent economic slowdown, the current skills development landscape is experiencing a paradigm shift. In a post-COVID economy, the need for efficient enterprises and a technically enabled labour force will increase at an exponential rate. The time calls for initiatives to support enterprise growth along with efficient employment generation, such as increasing growth through diversification of products and better integration of training and labour markets. At the same time, both private and public institutions need to demonstrate sensitivity to areas like decent work, institutional accountability, and qualitative improvement in labour rights, which are critical to shaping the future of the Bangladeshi labour force.

B-SkillFUL has successfully ensured labour market insertion for thousands of poor and disadvantaged individuals through skills development training and subsequent employment in SMEs. The project has been supporting Bangladesh in achieving SDG 8, Decent Work, and Economic Growth. Building on these achievements, it requires a significant stride from the enterprises to take lead on the next generation of skills development initiatives that include initial skills development and upskilling of their employees. There should be initiatives from the government and development partners to further support these thriving enterprises to modernise and upgrade their labour force management, production processes, and product development, and promote diversification to introduce a systemic incentive-based model on skills development schemes.

375,Bloodbath on Road 32,"August 15, 1975. A false dawn spread its pale light across the sky. At the residence of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, everybody was still in deep sleep. It was a bizarre moment for the country, medieval in its dark dimensions. Tanks rolled down Sher-e-Banglanagar and made their way towards Dhanmondi. In a matter of minutes, soldiers, led by a group of majors and colonels, were storming the historic house on Road 32. Bangabandhu desperately worked the telephones. General KM Shafiullah, the army chief of staff, asked him if he could move out of his home. That was an impossibility. All hell broke loose as bullets pinged and whizzed around. The Father of the Nation was assassinated along with his family on the land he had freed just four years back.

377,Want to know Switzerland? Start by its cuisine,"One of the best ways to learn about a culture is by discovering the nation's food habit. When it comes to describing Swiss cuisine, “variety is the spice of life” would be the most relevant narrative to use. Just as diverse as the culture and languages are in Switzerland, the nation's assorted food palate also extracts and combines cuisines from its bordering German, French and North Italian regions. Like the language divisions, the Swiss cuisine is also heavily influenced by its natural landscape with regional connotations to it. Not only that, while Switzerland derives from its neighbouring cuisines, it customizes the recipe with local ingredients cooked in own local style, giving the cuisines a very Swiss touch to it. That is how the Swiss food culture has developed its own mystique and flavours!

It is not possible to pinpoint to a single Swiss cuisine because of its varied nature, and the culinary diversity can be observed as one travels through the country. A typical dish that is popular across the nation would be Rösti — Swiss-style buttery home fried grated potatoes or Swiss hash-browns. It is usually topped with cheese, roasted onions or even fried eggs depending on the region. Sometimes Rösti is also served with main dishes, such as the famous Zürcher Geschnetzeltes - this Zurich-style creamy shredded veal meat. In some cantons, it is also served with noodles or rice. When speaking of the nation's cuisine, one cannot ignore to mention the prevalent presence of cheese in its various dishes, especially the popularly known Fondue. Mainly originating from the French-speaking part of the country, the Swiss palate consist of long tradition of cheese production with over 450 different types of cheeses ranging from hard to soft cheese, cottage cheese, valley factory cheese all with their own distinct taste and flavour. Gruyère is the best known with others including Sbrinz, Appenzeller, Raclette and Tête de Moine.

Also it is no secret that the nation's large talent lies in chocolate production – the fame of which has crossed international borders and is renowned across the world. Starting from the invention of milk chocolate in early 19th century, the nation's cuisine is highly enriched by variety of chocolatey treats; from chocolate bars to pralines and spread.

The Zurich-styled Zürcher Geschnetzeltes with sliced tenderloin beef (as an alternate to original recipe of veal meat) in mushroom and cream sauce can be prepared in Bangladesh as well. The recipe is presented below- Enjoy!

Meat

600 gm of tenderloin beef, sliced into thin strips

Butter as needed for frying

1 tablespoon of plain flour to sprinkle all over the tenderloin strips, and coat well

In a frying pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter until it is slightly foamy, immediately add the meat and quickly brown on all sides for about 3 minutes each side. And then set aside the meat to a dish and cover with foil to keep warm.

Sauce

1 tablespoon of butter, melt in the same pan

200 gm of mushrooms, ½ sliced onions (finely chopped) and 2 cloves of garlic minced. Sauté the onion and garlic together for a minute or two and then stir in the mushrooms and add one teaspoon of fresh lemon zest (finely chopped) and cook until mushrooms begin to soften, about 5 minutes.

200 ml cream to be blended well and added to pan, bringing to boil, stirring and cook for approx. another 3 minutes

Return the cooked veal meat to pan, warm through and add salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with 2 tablespoons of finely chopped parsley leaves

Preparation time: approx. 40 mins.",2018-07-31 18:00:00,https://thedailystar.net/supplements/want-know-switzerland-start-its-cuisine-1614262,2023-05-18 10:25:54,thedailystar
378,Discovering Switzerland and Bangladesh: Two different perspectives,"Switzerland and Bangladesh have strong bilateral ties in the areas of development cooperation, economy and culture. Nevertheless, the people of the two countries often do not know a lot about each other. We interviewed two young people from both countries – a Bangladeshi who is currently pursuing higher studies in Switzerland and a Swiss who is working in the development sector in Bangladesh – to find out their impressions and experiences about the other country.

Zaker Ahmad is Bangladeshi. In 2013, Mr Ahmad went to Switzerland for his master's degree. He is now pursuing his PhD there.

What was your experience when you went to Switzerland for the first time?

I was living in the German part of Switzerland where people mostly speak Swiss German. I had to overcome a language barrier. However, people were very friendly. When I passed by strangers in the streets they would greet me with a “grüezi” (hello), though it took me some time to understand what this word meant.

Did you face any difficulty during that time?

Getting to know the food and my way around the city was a challenge. Transport and communication systems are good, so people are very independent and it is not common to ask or take help from anyone. After some days, I could get my bearings and became independent too. The food here is more diverse and very different from Bangladesh.

What do you think about the Swiss cuisine?

Switzerland made me “addicted” to its cheese. Bread and cheese are now staples for me. The typical Swiss dishes are very heavy; I have heard that is because Switzerland was a predominantly agrarian society in the past. By the way, this is something unique about Switzerland where traditional lifestyle still goes hand in hand with modern lifestyle.

Angela Bommer is Swiss. She is currently working in Bangladesh for the Swiss Red Cross.

Did you discover a new passion, like a hobby or a sport here in Bangladesh?

I like the works of famous Rabindranath Tagore and other contemporary novelists and poets in Bangladesh. Since I moved to Bangladesh, I have read many books and I have also started to write myself, feeling inspired by all the literature and poems. However, many books are still only available in Bangla.

Which aspect of Bangladesh surprise you the most?

The richness and the diversity in culture surprised me. Depending on which part of the country you go, you will find a completely different Bangladesh. Every corner has its own cultural highlights and specialties.

In your opinion, what could the Swiss learn from the Bangladeshis?

I feel that people in Bangladesh are very resilient. They may face many difficulties in their daily life (tremendous traffic, heavy rain, etc.) but somehow most of the people deal with it in a very positive way and can cope well with it. For example, if Swiss people had to face such traffic jam on a daily basis, I cannot even imagine the consequences.",2018-07-31 18:00:00,https://thedailystar.net/supplements/discovering-switzerland-and-bangladesh-two-different-perspectives-1614259,2023-05-18 10:25:56,thedailystar
379,Swiss companies have long standing investments in crucial sectors,"Economic relations between Switzerland and Bangladesh are stronger than ever. After many years of steady growth, annual bilateral trade between the two countries reached US $680 million in 2017. This amount is almost three times that which Bangladesh and Switzerland traded in 2010. Behind the numbers, there is a growing mutual interest from both Swiss and Bangladeshi companies in looking for business partners in the other country. Many Swiss companies have been making successful direct investments in Bangladesh through local subsidiaries. Small and medium-sized Swiss businesses, which are the backbone of the Swiss economy, are gradually becoming more interested in doing business in Bangladesh.

Some of these Swiss ventures started in Bangladesh decades ago. Besides the inflow of financial capital to Bangladesh, a long history of innovation and best practices has accompanied these investments. The story of the economic success of Bangladesh is also a story of partnership with Swiss businesses.

Partnership and Knowledge Sharing

Bangladesh has attained impressive socio-economic achievements over the last decades in various sectors. The Bangladeshi private sector, besides other actors, has played a pivotal role to this end. Swiss companies have contributed to this tremendous success story. For instance, Swiss pharma investments arrived in 1973, and since then have been promoting the latest treatment solutions, collaborating with local partners and producing high quality health care products in Bangladesh. The pharma industry of Bangladesh currently meets 98 percent of local demand and continues to grow its exports each year. Produced in Bangladesh, medicines from a Swiss company are being exported to 55 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, creating hundreds of direct jobs.

Along the value chain from agricultural fields to the consumer table, Swiss companies enhance the competitive edge of the Bangladeshi food industry. In the city of Bogra, 200 kilometers northwest of Dhaka, the local branch of a Swiss agribusiness company keeps a state-of-the-art training facility and a dedicated Research and Development (R&D) centre to serve the market. In rural areas of Bangladesh, they are offering fertiliser solutions, essential inputs and high-tech machinery for grain storage and processing. The production of Swiss branded food and beverages in Bangladesh replaces importation and creates more than 4,300 direct and indirect jobs in the country.

Switzerland is also a world-renowned centre for engineering, chemical products, and precision machinery. This makes Swiss products essential for increasing the productivity of industries like construction, garments, oil and gas. Swiss machinery and engineering companies have invested in Bangladesh to provide services to local costumers, employing qualified professionals like engineers and proficient technicians. This creates opportunities for professionals to advance their skills by working together. The information technology sector is another example of a Swiss economic engagement with Bangladesh, which fosters innovation and ideas.

Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development

By addressing the long-term sustainability of global and local economies, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is key to creating value, not only for shareholders, but also for society. Swiss companies are among the organisations championing CSR in Bangladesh. The biggest Swiss investors are taking the opportunity to link core business activities with social action. One example is a Swiss food company that joined efforts with local NGOs to offer training on farming techniques, thus developing local suppliers for high quality rice, honey, and spices. Social projects backed by Swiss ventures in Bangladesh also support children's education and nutrition, and facilitate the access of health workers to rural areas and raise awareness of environmental issues, among many other initiatives.

Different Swiss companies are venturing into various sectors of the Bangladeshi economy. The impact of these investments runs deep and generates long-term gains, such as an increasing diversity in the business environment and higher local quality standards. Successful cooperation has already brought great benefits.",2018-07-31 18:00:00,https://thedailystar.net/supplements/swiss-companies-have-long-standing-investments-crucial-sectors-1614256,2023-05-18 10:25:58,thedailystar
380,Making a difference in delivering public services,"The progress and prosperity of Bangladesh over the recent decade has been driven by the rise in trade, commerce and business activities. The private sector led growth can be best witnessed by the vibrancy of the capital city, Dhaka. With a population of 18 million who make around 30 million daily trips in public and private transport, traffic congestion has become a part of everyday life.

The government has been working on a multi-sectorial strategy to reduce traffic congestion and increase the range of public infrastructure services available. Investment plans in different modes of public transport infrastructure, such as Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), flyovers and elevated expressways, have already been finalised with the construction of underway for a number of these transport networks.

To ensure that transport infrastructure can meet public service requirements, the government in its 7th Five Year Plan has identified the need to increase investment in transport infrastructure from around $3.5bn per year to approximately $12.5bn per year over a five year plan period.

However, sourcing this significant amount of financing is a key challenge. It is in this context that the government has prioritised the application of Public Private Partnership modality in the delivery of transport infrastructure.

By tapping into private sector finance to meet investment gaps, government can accelerate the pace of development and fast track the socio-economic benefits for the nation. However, without the establishment of a robust regulatory framework, successfully realising PPP projects can be challenging. There is a need to blend public service delivery needs with private sector investment returns. There are interface risks between timely delivery of government commitments, such as land acquisition and utility shifting, and the commencement of private sector construction. Risk allocation needs to be carefully structured to ensure that the private sector is not taking on risks that they are unable to manage.

The challenges of delivering a PPP project in advance of the establishment of a completed regulatory framework can be identified from the Dhaka Elevated Expressway Project. Originally signed in 2011, by Ital-Thai Development Public Company, the concession agreement had to be amended in 2014 to address issues in land acquisition. The resulting change in alignment and the need to revise the designs and other consequential matters meant that the transaction structure was not sufficiently mature to complete the necessary financing arrangements. Added to this was the size of the transaction; with a capital cost of $1.2bn, the Dhaka Elevated Expressway is one of the largest PPP road projects in South Asia. This created significant challenges in raising the necessary finances for a project of such size, made all the more acute given the limited domestic market for long term financing.

However, it is in the First Dhaka Elevated Expressway PPP Project that one can witness the true nature of PPPs. Despite the various project changes, difficulties and delays, the strong partnership ethos between the private sector and government has shone through. With a commitment to ensuring the delivery of the project, both parties have shown willingness and a keen determination to maximise co-operation within the framework of the PPP contract. This flexible attitude within a structured approach has helped the project to overcome its initial difficulties and has now set it on the path to delivery.

Construction Commence Date for the project, representing the formal start of the concession period, was issued on April 1, 2018. The private sector has demonstrated their commitment by already investing around $100m in carrying out bored piling, footing and pile cap works, and installing pile columns and cross beams for the first phase of construction. Additional equity injection from new consortium members is expected, and discussions are at a final stage for the financing of the project from international lenders.

With the PPP regulatory framework now in place and PPP projects being subject to additional scrutiny, enhanced project preparation and a more standardised and balanced risk structure being applied, it is expected that many of the challenges faced by the Dhaka Elevated Expressway Project will be addressed for future projects and help to accelerate the pace of development.

With the Dhaka Elevated Expressway project, followed by the Dhaka Bypass PPP project and a number of other PPP road projects in Dhaka, in addition to the MRT and BRT projects, as well as other public sector projects, we can see that Dhaka is well on its way to having the range and quality of transport infrastructure services that is needed to meet its dynamism and growth trajectory.

381,FOURTH OF JULY AND MAIN STREETS,"The Fourth of July is, first and foremost, a birthday party. Americans mark the day in 1776 when 13 English colonies adopted a Declaration of Independence and the United States of America was born.

Just as birthday parties come in all shapes and sizes — from the small gathering of friends to the raucous birthday blow-out—Fourth of July celebrations across America run from very small to very big. If you happen to be visiting, wherever you are, there is likely to be a parade. If you're in a small town in Iowa, it might feature the town fire truck, neighborhood children riding bicycles decorated with streamers and not much more. If you go to Alameda, California, near San Francisco, you'll join 20,000 spectators along a three-mile route to cheer for marching bands, horses and enormous parade floats.

Shown here is Anchorage, a small city of 300,000 in the south of Alaska, which starts its Fourth of July with a pancake breakfast on the Delaney Park Strip in the middle of town. “There are booths with different activities and food,” said Paula Conru, a longtime resident. “Everybody hangs out there, and then you watch the parade. There are fire trucks, old fashioned cars and marching bands.” (Picture-1)

But since Anchorage is so far north, the fireworks run on a later schedule. “The fireworks go off at midnight,” Conru said, “and it's still not really truly dark outside.”

Darkness falls earlier 3,300 miles away in New York. There, the city's 8 million residents can watch 22 tons of pyrotechnics launched over a mile-and-a-half stretch of the Hudson River in one of the nation's biggest fireworks extravaganzas.

In New York, fireworks explode over the Hudson River behind the Empire State Building, lit red, white and blue for the Fourth of July. (Picture-2)

But don't be entirely distracted by the bright colors and patriotic music. Whether it's in a rural Midwest town square with a pie-baking contest and sparklers, or in Boston Harbor accompanied by an orchestra and cannons, Fourth of July celebrations are joined by a spirit of pride in folks' identity as Americans and a sense that communities—small, medium-sized or big—define them.",2018-07-03 18:10:00,https://thedailystar.net/supplements/fourth-july-and-main-streets-1599382,2023-05-18 10:26:02,thedailystar
382,"3, 2, 1: Bangladesh is Taking Off","The successful launch of Bangabandhu-1 on May 11 makes Bangladesh one of 75 countries with a satellite in space. (© SpaceX)

Bangladesh has achieved many milestones since its independence in 1971. The latest is its entrance to the space age. A Bangladeshi communications satellite was launched into orbit on May 11 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Bangabandhu-1 is named after Bangladesh's founding father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, his daughter, said that joining the world's satellite club will “bring revolutionary changes in our broadcast and telecommunications sector,” including extending broadband internet service for the first time to more than 750 rural communities.

Building “Digital” Bangladesh

The geostationary satellite orbiting 35,000 kilometers above the Earth will improve telecommunications services across the country. Bangladesh also may generate revenue by renting out excess capacity to Indonesia, the Philippines and other neighbors.

“We've relentlessly been working to build digital Bangladesh since 2009,” said the prime minister.

The launch reflects an international public-private partnership. A French company built the satellite, and SpaceX, the space transportation company founded by American entrepreneur Elon Musk, provided the Falcon 9 rocket that lifted Bangabandhu-1 into high orbit.

The first stage of the launch vehicle returned to land upright and intact on a SpaceX drone ship in the Atlantic. The reusable launcher is designed to make 10 return trips with minimal repair.

The U.S. Embassy in Dhaka and the U.S. Department of Commerce were instrumental in connecting Bangladesh and SpaceX.

The satellite will allow people in rural Bangladesh to connect with their families in cities, enable remote schools to access advanced learning materials, and help software engineers “tap into work opportunities at home and abroad,” said Tom Vajda, a State Department official who attended the launch.

The government of Bangladesh has launched an initiative to help develop 2 million young information-and-communications technology professionals by 2021.

383,Peace and Tolerance: Challenges and Way Forward,"Abdul Quayum, Associate Editor, Prothom Alo and Moderator of the Roundtable

Two years ago, on July 1, an act of intolerance took the lives of almost 29 people. Apart from the Holey Artisan attack, other isolated acts of violent extremism shook the country within a short span of time. Thanks to the tactical efforts of our law enforcement agencies, we have been successful in containing such terrorist activities to an extent. However, we can truly be successful only when we are able to create awareness amidst people that intolerance, bigotry and killings can never be the answer. Those in the public sphere should also be careful to not offend religious sentiments or instigate any group of people through our writings or other activities. Additionally, we also need to remind people that there are legal measures and other tolerant ways to confront statements that may inadvertently hurt public sentiments.

Under the charismatic leadership of Bangabandhu we liberated the country. We dreamt of a developed Bangladesh where there would be equal opportunity for all citizens and the rule of law would be established. We are hopeful that just as the way the country has moved forward in terms of economy, health and job opportunities, we will also carry on our journey to a tolerant and peaceful future.

Mir Manzur Mahmud, Chairman, Council for Social Development Foundation

Bangladesh is a land of communal harmony and people are living here peacefully since time immemorial. Unfortunately, this glorious tradition is now at stake. We are failing to uphold the spirit of Liberation War.

Peace is closely connected with tolerance. We have to be tolerant to establish peace in the society. The main barrier towards establishing peace is intolerance. In an intolerant society a minor incident can cause a havoc.

Good thoughts come from good faith. It leads to positive action. We have to spread good thoughts through education.

I have had the opportunity to work with over 100 youth leaders and scholars, and several intra- and inter-faith leaders of the country. While working with some faith leaders, I asked them to recite some excerpts of their sermons. I learnt that some of these leaders would often use the word bidhormi (infidels) in their sermon. When I explained to them that this was offensive to people of other faiths and showed an attitude of intolerance and bigotry, they said that they never meant to disparage other religious beliefs, but never realized that they were using the wrong words. Instead of calling them 'infidels', I explained that the term 'people of other faith' would show far more compassion and tolerance.

If faith leaders are able to promote values of mutual respect, tolerance and acknowledgement in their speech, actions and instructions, it can bring about a change in people's thought process. If a religious leader, for example, is able to help people of other faiths or even offer comfort to those in distress, he will be paving a path for others to follow, as they will witness firsthand that their leader does not only talk the talk but is also able to walk the talk.

Md. Riaz Uddin Khan, Media Expert and Chief Moderator, Community Radio Hackathon 2018

Through our work on community radio, we noticed that the important issue of communal harmony and tolerance has more or less been neglected. While there is an understanding of the importance of the issue, there is little public discussion on it. The public is hesitant about discussing about this subject as arguments and disagreements often rise from these discussions, and so public participation in raising awareness about a peaceful and tolerant society is quite limited.

Mass media can play a strong role in increasing public participation in activities that promote peace and tolerance. Mass media has four essential roles: to inform, to educate, to entertain, and to persuade. If these functions are performed with diligence and honesty, it can bring about a positive change in a person's way of thinking and motivate them to take steps towards a more peaceful society. But national media cannot fully meet the information demand of diverse population. Community radio can successfully fill this gap.

Community radio can act as an important and powerful agent of change. There are several research studies which show how people can be engaged through community radio, and motivated to be active citizens of the country. This is because those involved with community radio are most often members of the community. They speak the language of the community and are able to reflect the issues and problems of a particular group of people. Thus, when the community itself is engaged, they are bound to be attracted to and be persuaded by the messages relayed.

Recently we organized Community Radio Hackathon 2018, involving 17 community radios of Bangladesh where most of the participants were youth. They conducted some intensive discussion and found that inter-community relationships, mental wellbeing and social media, among other vital factors, are affecting peace and tolerance in the community. Through such assessments and findings, they developed and broadcast different types of programmes focusing peace and tolerance. The programme also focused on engaging people, particularly youth, in socio-cultural activities to promote harmony in the community. Many organizations are working towards establishing peace and tolerance. If they incorporate community radio in their programmes their efforts would be more productive.

On behalf of UN Women, we have been implementing a regional programme titled 'Preventing Violent Extremism' in three countries since 2017. The UN Women programme in Bangladesh is titled 'Women in Ensuring Peace and Tolerance', through which we tried to identify factors which motivate women to engage in terrorist activities. Under this programme, we want to work with female perpetrators of terrorist activities, to help them realize that they too can play a positive role in combatting terrorism. Through our initiative, we are trying to offer protection to women who are involved in such deviant activities perhaps without even realizing the magnitude of their actions.

We worked with women of six districts, including refugee camps and host communities in Cox's Bazar. Our work ranged from awareness raising to helping these women find ways of income generation so that they are not lured to deviant activities.

We have also included around 600 women in our financial inclusion package through which they are able to help other disadvantaged women in their community. These women have formed a group that they call 'Polli Shomaj'; this group unites women to identify miscreant activities in their community and allow them to take the case to their local police station.

It's been almost six years since the riots that devastated the minority communities in Ramu. Those who had created this situation were able to instigate people against an entire community. If the public felt that their religious beliefs were hurt, they could have taken legal recourse. Some patience and tolerance could have averted that frightful incident.

If we are to disregard certain isolated incidents, however, we will see that the sense of tolerance is entwined with the very soul of this country and its people. If that were not so, we would not have different religious communities and institutes co-existing peacefully.

We have to establish peace and tolerance to take the country to the global platform. Otherwise we will not be able to fulfil the dream of Bangabandhu.

Pervez Siddiqui, Films4Peace Foundation

We are working with the host community of Ukhia, Cox's Bazar. We spoke to different communities in Ukhia to determine the reasons behind extremism and disharmony. We discovered that women are not allowed to participate in public decision-making process. They do not have any suitable platform to voice their opinions, and even when they attempt to participate in public activities, the male members of the community do not view this in a positive light. In the five unions that we are working with in Ukhia, we observed that there are no cultural platforms, clubs or even parks and fields. Thus, drug peddlers and human traffickers have found access to the young members of the community. It is therefore very easy to convince this young population to engage in deviant acts.

While NGOs and international organisations are offering material help to the refugees in Ukhiya, the need for peace education is basically neglected. When we spoke to the host communities and state agencies, we discovered there is a sense of conflict, as due to the refugee influx, young men of the host community are not getting any employment opportunities. Local businesses are not able to make profits due to various reasons, including the fact that they have to shut down their shops when VIPs visit the camps. All of this has led to rising conflicts and a tense situation.

Abdulla Al Mamun, Programme Coordinator, Manusher Jonno Foundation

We need to look at the factors to identify who is being lured to religious extremism by whom and why. Population dividend needs to be looked at, alongside the rising use of technology. While the use of social media is getting more and more popular, there is not much knowledge amongst the public about how to use the internet and what to follow and what not to follow. Moreover, with rapid urbanisation, more and more young people are coming into the cities for work. While the eight hours of their work are accounted for, we have no idea what they do with their free time, who they meet or are inspired by, and whether they are involved in any wrongdoing. Even in schools and education institutions, communal disharmony and intolerance is creeping in, as students can often be found comparing and fighting over their religions.

I am not worried about religious extremism in Bangladesh as law enforcers have been able to more or less bring these factions under control. However, I am worried about the spread of reactionary thoughts. We need to address and identify this to avoid other incidents like Ramu.

Manusher Jonno Foundation tried to identify the narratives used by extremist groups and the alternative narrations can be used to counter them. We also need capacity building to promote peace building amongst communities. Furthermore, we need to promote cultural thinking, a space for debates and discussions, and skills development. We need to create positive role models, and monitor social media while developing strong alternative contents.

Umme Habiba, Project Coordinator, Prerona

Many youth organisations are working toward peace and tolerance but if we can bring them under one umbrella, the work can get more traction. We should not just talk about promoting peace and tolerance but also uphold and protect the strong values that already exist in our country.

Our organization works with students in private universities. Unfortunately, a majority of these students don't have any idea about the meaning of intolerance, as they associate this word only with violence. They can't understand how intolerance affect their daily life or is reflected through their actions. When they are asked about how to create a tolerant, harmonious society, they are unable to say anything. This is because they are not given the space to learn about tolerance and acceptance or given access to the rule of law.

We also encourage students to initiate cultural programmes, debates, seminars, and other knowledge based endeavours to identify and understand about the space of tolerance and intolerance, not only in the political or religious sphere, but also in the economic, personal, social and everyday life.

Shazzad Hossain Mukit, Director, Funush Pvt Ltd.

Lack of knowledge about a person or a group of people feeds the othering process. For example, the word Rohingya has become a derogatory term in our country. If people become aware about the rich history of the Rohingya community, the feeling of otherness can disappear. We are producing educative content for both online and off-line platforms to bridge this knowledge gap.

Career-related frustration often leads to involvement in violent activities. We are working on creating an online platform where young people will get evidence-based advice to help plan their career. For example, in Bangladesh we need more nurses than doctors. Our medical institutions are overwhelmingly focused on producing doctors but little attention is given to training nurses. If students have a clear idea about the job sector, they will be able to plan their career path in an informed manner.

Fawzia Khondokar, Executive Director, Pragroshor

When children see domination, intolerance and violence in their family, it affects them negatively. They try to imitate what they learn from their family in the outside world. Furthermore, excessive use of social media and internet leaves little time for family members to spend together. Therefore, we need to begin with the family and instil values of tolerance in children by strengthening family relationships. Our educational institutions also have a big role in this regard.

Siddhartho Goswami, Project Associate, Violence Cluster, UNDP

Different organizations are taking different kinds of initiatives to tackle intolerance and violence. There should be coordination and exchange of knowledge and information among different entities working in the same field.

UNDP, in cooperation with government and non-government organizations, and academia, has developed a database platform called Bangladesh Peace Observatory Facility (BPO). It will provide data, analysis, research, and education opportunities to create better understanding of the state of violence in the country and how to counter it.

We need to change the mindset of labelling people minority based on their religious identity. Minority are those people who think in communal line.

More emphasis should be given on teaching moral education in primary and secondary schools. We have to instil the sense of Bengaliness in students through celebration of our culture and tradition. Young people should be effectively engaged in deradicalisation programmes.

Swami Dhrubeshananda, Principal, Ramakrishna Mission, Dhaka

No religion promotes intolerance. We need to learn about the values of every religion and respect them. We conduct a school which is open to all. Here we teach students about different religions. We regularly hold seminars where students from different religious backgrounds participate and share their values. It helps to know each other and create inter-religious harmony. We need more of such initiatives all over the country.

Dr Mohammad Monzur-E- Elahi, Associate Professor, National University

False information and knowledge gap contributes to intolerance. Educational and religious institutions and media have a big role in educating people and countering any sort of propaganda. Our educational institutions have to provide quality education so that students learn how to differentiate between the truth and lies. They have to instill love for knowledge in their students. Similarly, religious institutions have the responsibility to counter any false propaganda which promotes religious intolerance. Media also needs to be more alert in countering fake news and false information.

Youth unemployment is a big problem in the country. When a person does not have any productive work to do, he or she might be involved in deviant acts. We have to create adequate opportunities to engage our young population productively.

Md Kabir Hossain, Former Public Prosecutor, Dhaka Metropolitan

I have dealt with several terrorism cases and had the scope of talking to terrorists, including Mufti Hannan. When I asked them why they had committed such violent acts, they did not have any valid explanation. Some of them admitted that they led the attack in hopes of going to heaven in the afterlife. In most cases, they were brainwashed and misguided. Hence, our efforts should be directed towards countering misinterpretation of religion.

Abdul Mannan, Assistant Deputy Commissioner, Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) Unit, Dhaka Metropolitan Police

I want to pay my deepest respect to the brave boy Faraaz Ayaaz Hossain, who has set a great example of humanity and friendship, which are crucial forces in the fight against violent extremism.

We are conducting an extensive research on violent extremism in collaboration with Dhaka University. The research results will be made public soon. We are also preparing a database of the terrorists incorporating detailed information about their life and how they were radicalized. These initiatives will help fill the existing knowledge gap in this field.

I think radicalisation of the general public is more threatening than some isolated terrorist attacks. Unfortunately, this threat is growing rapidly in our country. It is the first stage of terrorism. Every radicalized person is a potential terrorist. After studying the background of terrorists, I found that most of them were brought up in a radicalised environment. This is due to the deterioration of our secular culture and deviation from the spirit of Liberation War. Our family values have also become weak. Children do not find their role models in parents or teachers. Our efforts should be directed towards stopping this ominous trend. We have to repair our social value system.

We have to make people immune to religious extremism through proper education and correct theological explanation. It will also help to bring back radicalized people to the path of peace and tolerance.

Instead of just publishing news about terrorist attacks, media should focus more on bringing out the story behind how a person is radicalised so that people can be aware of it. General people need to be made aware of the harmful effects of religious extremism.

To de-radicalise a person, we have to show love and sympathy and help him or her to come out of it. Family members should inform the law enforcement agencies about involvement of any family member or relatives in extremist activities. If they inform on time there will be an opportunity to bring back the person from ensuing danger.",2018-06-30 18:00:00,https://thedailystar.net/round-tables/peace-and-tolerance-challenges-and-way-forward-1597726,2023-05-18 10:26:06,thedailystar
384,Celebrating the French National Day with Bangladesh,"Marie-Annick Bourdin Ambassador of France to Bangladesh

France celebrates its National Day in commemoration of the storming of the Bastille in Paris on the 14th of July 1789. It remains the powerful symbol of the French revolutionary fight for emancipation from a then absolute monarchy, followed a few weeks later by the landmark proclamation of the “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen”, opening the long and arduous way to the establishment of democracy and the rule of law.

Bangladesh and France have nurtured warm and friendly relations since the early days of the fight for Independence led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1971; the support lent to him by André Malraux remains in our collective memory. Since then, through high-level political exchanges and visits, our two countries have developed a fruitful dialogue on numerous issues of common interest.

H.E. Mr. Emmanuel Macron, President of the French Republic, received H.E. Sheikh Hasina, the Honorable Prime Minister, in Paris last December. He expressed our gratitude and warm appreciation for the generous welcome and protection granted by Bangladesh to some 800,000 Rohingya refugees forced to flee Myanmar since August. He confirmed our active support in the UN Security Council and Human Rights Council, in order to press for an end to violence and bringing their perpetrators to justice.

Both leaders also exchanged on sustainable development and in particular combatting climate change, reaffirming their shared commitment to the full implementation of the Paris Agreement signed in 2015, prior to Sheikh Hasina's presentation of the commitments of Bangladesh, one of the most vulnerable State-Parties, during the “One Planet Summit”.

Sustainable Development is indeed the focus of our official development assistance, operated by the Agence Française de Développement, which aims among other things, at ensuring access to potable water, facilitating sustainable urban transportation, enlarging access to energy and improving its efficiency. In terms of scientific and technical cooperation, we have also focused our efforts on environment-related issues, such as oceanography, hydrology, renewable energies…

Our President has also marked his appreciation for the sustained path of economic growth in Bangladesh over the last 10 years, and underlined that France is also contributing to the economic development of Bangladesh through our private sector companies, supplying high quality and sustainable technologies. France has been very happy to join in sharing the pride of your country after the successful launch of the first Bangladesh's communication satellite Bangabandhu-I, built by the French company Thales Alenia Space, marking the entry of your country in a new era. We will soon witness the launch of other high quality projects, notably in the field of water treatment (Dhaka WASA and Suez-Veolia) and energy.

We are convinced that we can do a lot more together: working for peace and stability in international fora and in our respective regions; ensuring sustainable development for all; promoting our shared attachment to education, language and culture; and, as we will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the 10th of December consolidating democracy and defending the human rights of all women and men in the world as well as in our respective countries.",2018-07-13 18:00:00,https://thedailystar.net/supplements/celebrating-the-french-national-day-bangladesh-1604926,2023-05-18 10:26:08,thedailystar
385,Rethinking urban spaces: Dhaka and beyond,"Editor's Note

This issue, titled Rethinking Urban Spaces: Dhaka and Beyond, is the fourth instalment of our 216-page special supplement series on the occasion of The Daily Star's 27th anniversary.

Dhaka is a city of historical roots and deep problems; a city we love and sometimes love to hate. As the urban share of the country's population increases, the problems we face become more acute. But we like to think that none of the problems we face today is beyond solution. Be it traffic congestion, lack of public spaces, encroached waterbodies, or issues of decentralisation, we look towards a future Dhaka which would be a city at once modern, liveable and yet rooted in our history. For that, we need to rethink our priorities when it comes to planning, be mindful of preserving our heritage and invest in infrastructure that are needed for today and the future. And, as the country dips its toes out of the LDC category, our concerns cannot remain with Dhaka only—development and planning must decentralise towards a wider vision for the whole country.

Towards that visions, in this segment eminent academics, engineers, planners and professionals tackle some of these issues with their insightful and rich articles. Some look towards a Dhaka of the future, while others take a crack at the problems of our present. Together, they present the idea that a better Dhaka is possible and recommendations about how we can get there. We are grateful to all the writers who made this issue possible.

The last instalment of our supplement series, Changes that make us: #NowInLifestyle, is due to be published on the 24th. We wish you a very joyful and enlightening reading.

386,Dairy industry in Bangladesh: Prospects and roadblocks,"It may appear alien to many that traditional milk collectors and sellers, known as Goalas, used to visit households with their milk containers every morning to sell fresh milk. And households used to buy from them.

Over the last two to three decades, things have changed a lot. Several industrial processors have emerged—collecting, processing and selling milk and milk products in packaged form with the promise of hygiene and quality. And Goalas have started losing their prominence.

Today, an increasing number of people are shifting to packaged or powdered milk in their quest for safe food. At the same time, processors have increased processing and expanded their footprints in the urban landscape.

Now, more than half a dozen milk processors are processing 10 lakh litres of fresh milk daily, which is more than double the amount they could process a decade ago. And organised milk processors, gradually encouraged by business prospects arising out of increasing demand for milk and milk products, are increasing the volume of processing.

“With a change in food habits, we find that there is growth of milk consumption every year,” said Md Muniruzzaman, executive director of PRAN Dairy Ltd, a concern of the country's biggest agro-processor Pran.

Pran, now the market leader in UHT (Ultra Heat Treatment) and pasteurised milk category, entered the sector in 2003 sensing immense potential in the dairy sector because of a deficit in domestic milk production against demand. As a result, the country has to import more than 100,000 tonnes of powdered milk and dairy products by spending Tk 2,000 crore a year, according to data by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and Bangladesh Bank.

Industry insiders have said that this huge supply-demand gap offers business prospects as there is scope to increase milk yield per cow in the country as there is a high density of cattle population.

The World Bank, recently in a document, said growing demands for animal source food, a high density of cattle population, very high potential for productivity improvement, agro-ecological conditions favourable to feed production, availability of crop residues, and a culture of mixed crop-livestock farming represent assets the sector can build on.

Muniruzzman said Bangladeshi cows are low in yield providing 2-5 litres of milk per day. “If new breeds of cows are developed, they can provide even 14-15 litres of milk per day. This is not an overnight process but a gradual one that will develop generation by generation. Within 10-20 years, this can be done,” he said adding that Pran works with 12,000 farmers in five dairy hubs in four districts—Rangpur, Natore, Pabna and Sirajganj—to improve productivity.

He said because of a deficit in domestic production, Bangladesh still has to import a huge amount of powdered milk every year to meet the demand of households and sweets industry, as well as for making value-added products like cheese, butter and yogurt.

“This is because farmers did not even consider dairy as their profession like they do farming. Even today in the villages, farmers consider the cows to be the responsibility of their wives while they concentrate on the bulls, which they can use for ploughing land,” he said.

Dairy farming expanding

However, things are changing.

New faces are entering the dairy farming sector and many existing farmers are focusing on improving productivity of their cows through artificial insemination, providing better care and proper feeding.

In addition, milk processors such as Milk Vita, Pran and Aarong are supporting farmers.

“Many educated youths have started cattle farming for milk and meat production in the last five years. As a result, supply of milk is now double the amount produced five years back,” said Mohammad Shah Emran, general secretary of Bangladesh Dairy Farmers' Association (BDFA).

Emran started his farm, Shopno Dairy and Fisheries, at Trishal in Mymensingh, with only two milking cows and three heifers, in early 2015. Today, it has 22 cows, including 12 milking cows.

The Department of Livestock Services (DLS) also registers increasing farming activities. Some 58,590 farms, each with 10 or more cows, have registered with DLS for dairy purposes till now. Of those, 155 farms signed up since July this fiscal year, according to DLS.

New dairy zones have emerged in Gazipur, Savar, Rangpur and great Jessore in the last several decades apart from the traditional milk production Pabna-Sirajganj area, according to two officials of DLS.

“Overall farming is rising as demand for milk and milk-based products is growing in urban and semi-urban areas,” said DLS Assistant Director (Farm), ABM Khaleduzzaman.

“Previously, cattle farming had been limited to smallholders in rural areas. This has changed in recent years. Dairy farms have been established in urban and suburban areas,” he said, adding that more than 1,000 cattle farms have been established in areas surrounding Dhaka city, particularly in Dhaka's outskirt Keraniganj.

National average milk yield has also increased from 1.5 litres in the 90s, he added.

Md Hossain Shah Newaz, assistant general manager, marketing of BRAC Dairy, said 90.9 lakh tonnes of milk production would be required in the year 2025 in Bangladesh with a modest population growth rate and per capita milk consumption of 120 ml. Total yearly requirement will be 1.90 lakh tonnes if per capita daily milk consumption rises to 250 ml as suggested by the World Health Organization.

“Now we are highly dependent on imported powdered milk. Therefore, local dairy industry has immense opportunities to grow,” he said.

Problems lying ahead

However, there are various issues hindering faster growth of dairy farming.

Apart from shortage of high yielding cows, scarcity of land for dairy farms, shortage of high yielding and quality semen for AI, lack of technical knowhow for farming, high cost of labour and feed, inadequate treatment facility for cattle and lack of knowledge of handling milk are the major hindrances for faster development of the sector, said farmers and industry stakeholders.

Above all, low tariff on powdered milk import affects farmers in getting fair prices for milk.

“Dairy is an emerging sector. It cannot grow unless higher tariff is imposed to discourage import of powdered milk,” said BDFA General Secretary Emran adding that import prices of milk remain low because of subsidy given to farmers and to the industry by countries in the West.

BRAC's Newaz said locally produced milk becomes less competitive than imported milk owing to low import duty.

As we consider powdered milk as baby food and impose less tax on its import, local milk becomes less competitive in the market. But the reality is that only 10 percent of the imported powdered milk is being used as baby food and the rest 90 percent is being used for other forms of consumption, he said.

Emran said improved semen is necessary to increase milk yields. “Semen import and marketing should be opened up to the private sector. Let there be competition,” he said demanding authorities make rules to provide information of genomic and progeny tests available to farmers.

What to do next

Emran said farms are slapped with electricity bills at commercial rates although dairy belongs to the agro-based sector. “This increases cost of our operation. We demand waiver from electricity bills at commercial rates as dairy belongs to the agro-based sector,” he said.

“We also need support to import modern equipment for dairy farming.”

Both Muniruzzaman and Newaz recommended establishing a Dairy Development Board soon to promote the sector.

“Formulate and implement a national dairy policy and National Dairy Development Board to create a platform for dairy development in the country,” said Newaz of BRAC Dairy.

Muniruzzaman suggested providing easy and low-cost credit facility for the farmers and subsidy in feed and medicine, increasing facilities for animal husbandry and treatment, and taking steps to improve breed of high yielding cows.

“Allow good entrepreneurs to import semen for breed development,” he said, also recommending duty restructuring to import machineries, chemicals and packaging materials for the dairy sector.

387,Why we need to talk about mental health and menstruation,"She feels energetic and determined to do all her work. She has got the urge to work hard and give her best. She is proactive about her submissions and feels confident about her ideas. Her performance chart has reached its peak and she has never felt so positive.

But soon after, sometime in the following days, she doesn't feel very upbeat. Fatigue creeps into her body and laziness wins over. Her temperament is often on the edge now and she suddenly seems critical of everything around her. At one point of time, she might have even felt a little too low and those skin breakouts have begun to take their toll on her. To add to her discomfort, she starts experiencing lower abdominal pain.

It became clear that it was that time of the month. She was on her period.

These mood changes are so subtle that they are not even cared for. The changing levels of hormones in the menstrual cycle are responsible for the emotional ride but sometimes the severity of mental conditions can be alarming and they may reflect a mental disorder.

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) are the main mental disorders linked to menstruation. While PMS involves mild symptoms and is more prevalent, PMDD is more severe and is noted in 3-7 percent of women. Dr Fahmida Ahmed, a psychiatric consultant of Modern Psychiatric Hospital in Dhaka, said, “Symptoms of PMDD branch out to mood, behavioural, and physical symptoms. The diagnostic criteria for PMDD include different classes of symptoms but the most important criterion is the duration in which the symptoms are notable. PMDD symptoms are present in the final week before the onset of menstruation and they start to improve after the onset. Symptoms are minimal or absent in the week after menstruation is over.” Dr Ahmed mentioned some of the major symptoms of PMDD which include mood swings, tearfulness and increased sensitivity to rejection; marked irritability or increased interpersonal conflicts; increased anxiety or tension; lethargy; marked change in appetite; hypersomnia or insomnia, etc. Both PMS and PMDD should be dealt with medical supervision and not just with consultation of a gynecologist but a psychiatrist as well. While medications can suppress your symptoms, advice from a psychiatrist will help you to deal with them, thus providing comprehensive treatment.

However, Dr Ahmed also had this to say: “Any kind of mental distress often goes unreported in our country. Had people been more cognisant about the mental health implications and consulted psychiatrists for treatment, their distress might have been better managed.”

It is no hidden fact that seeking treatment for menstrual complications and mental issues in our society is deemed unnecessary and even mocked. While the ever-so-natural phenomenon, menstruation, is considered a taboo topic. So this stigma emanating from the community makes it extremely difficult for young girls and women to own their physiology and share their discomfort. People are quick to misuse the term PMS without even realising its seriousness. Even some women don't support a fellow woman who is going through severe menstrual cramps and they instead call it an “overreaction”. The biggest challenge lies in the lack of opportunity to talk about menstruation-related health issues—more so of the mental kind. “Young girls, especially in a conservative family, are deprived of basic information about menstruation. So at the start of puberty, they can get scared about the sudden change and not have anyone to talk to about it,” said Dr Ahmed. Hence, she suggested that counselling should start from the family and while doing so, extra emphasis must be put into mental stability and menstrual hygiene.

Mood fluctuations are intertwined with the menstrual cycle and can be troublesome for women. Hence, the absence of understanding of these changes of the family, friends, peers, and society as a whole serves as a barrier and builds up and takes a toll on the mental state. Women need to have an environment where they can relieve themselves from mental burdens and receive the support they require. We, as a society, owe it to them and their good health. This does not mean that we will have to invade someone's privacy. It merely means that we need to acknowledge first and foremost that menstruation is a natural process and that its mental health implications are just as important as any other. By dissolving the stigma around menstruation and mental health, we can make way for solutions and get rid of the social obstacles that should not have been there in the first place.

389,Winning the fight against corrosion,"In conversation with Prof. Dr. A.F.M. Saiful Amin, Civil Engineering Dept., BUET

Do you know why the Statue of Liberty looks blue-green in colour? Originally the statue was dull brown, reflecting the natural colour of its copper plates. It turned blue-green due to a natural weathering process in which air and water acted on the copper plates. With this anecdote, Professor Saiful Amin explained the science behind corrosion.

He added that the electrochemical oxidation of metal occurs in reaction with an oxidant typically in presence of moisture. This is a triangle. Rusting, the formation of iron oxides, is a well-known example of electrochemical corrosion. To prevent corrosion, we have to break this triangle by removing one of the legs. The whole idea of corrosion prevention is based on such a scheme. For example, we apply paint to keep metal away from water and air. This is a widely used corrosion-prevention technique.

Professor Amin continued that large structures such as steel bridges, locomotives and trains require regular painting to protect them from corrosion. Oils and lubricants are generally used to cover the moving metal parts from air. These are costly and harmful to the environment. To reduce costs and the harmful effects of these elements, and to ensure durability, we need to focus on design. The surface area should be kept to a minimum by using box-shaped units instead of using smaller sections of angular or complicated geometries. New generation paints are more durable. We have also seen the introduction of stainless steel in building infrastructure. Stainless steel provides better protection against corrosion. Further improvement has happened in this sector, and now we have weathering steel, which is also called paintless steel. In this technology, some metals are used which, after being corroded, create a stable dense surface that prevents corrosion from propagating deep inside the steel. This is a beneficial use of corrosion. We have seen some projects in Bangladesh that are using weathering steel. This is a benchmark of development. Currently, a local steel company is producing epoxy-coated rebar, which is a reinforced bar with upgraded corrosion-prevention technology.

In reference to the protection of concrete structures from corrosion, Dr. Amin emphasised the use of quality concrete. In most cases, due to the poor quality of concrete, cracks develop in a structure in a more intensive way than expected in design. This greatly reduces the lifetime of the structure. Using corrosion resistant steel reinforcement, and increasing concrete density and the thickness of concrete around steel reinforcement, are some simple approaches that can be followed to prevent corrosion. He underlined that we have to invest in the prevention of corrosion to save the whole structure. The investment must be made at the initial stage. Though this additional investment decision is often dictated by the financial capacity of an owner, s/he should also consider the lifecycle cost of the infrastructure, opined the expert.

He elucidated the concept of the lifecycle cost of an infrastructure as an assessment of the total cost of the structure, which includes initial investment and operational and maintenance costs throughout its lifetime. It may increase initial cost but result in significantly reduced operating and maintenance costs in the longer term. Investment in prevention of corrosion is a part of this long-term thinking. Dr. Amin said that we have to make people aware about this good practice.

He also discussed the environmental factors of corrosion. In reference to the government's ongoing development works in coastal areas to exploit the potentials of the blue economy and maintenance of the infrastructure across the coastal belt, he emphasised the necessity of seriously considering the airborne salinity that readily and largely promotes corrosion in metals.

There are also other sources that exacerbate corrosive effects. Air pollution is one of these. He also pointed to the use of domestic and industrial wastes in landfills as an emerging concern. The gases released from such wastes have the potential to increase the rate of corrosion in metals and electronic equipment installed in the structure. Therefore, proper waste management is strongly connected to the prevention of corrosion.

Professor Amin concluded with the hope that both public and private sector will work together to create awareness about various aspects of corrosion and take necessary measures to protect our valuable structures.",2017-04-23 18:00:00,https://thedailystar.net/supplements/winning-the-fight-against-corrosion-1395619,2023-05-18 10:26:17,thedailystar
390,What you should know about corrosion,"HOW IT OCCURS

Corrosion is degradation of the properties of materials due to interactions with their environment. It results in loss of function of the component or system. Most metals are susceptible to corrosion.

There are various types of corrosion based on the nature of attack as well as the type of environment to which the material is exposed. The corrosion product we see most commonly is the rust which forms on the surface of steel.

HOW IT AFFECTS OUR EVERYDAY LIFE

Corrosion is a massive deteriorating problem. It is way more damaging than you might think. Corrosion is everywhere. It is in the pipes that bring us water in our home; it destroys vehicles; it attacks tracks and bridges.

Though the cost of corrosion is high, we generally pay little attention to it except in high risk areas. The segments that are most vulnerable to the cost of corrosion are associated with utilities, transportation, and infrastructure. Several studies show that the annual direct cost of corrosion to an industrial economy is approximately 3.1 percent of the country's Gross National Product (GNP), and globally the corrosion cost is over 6 percent of the world's GDP.

There are also health and safety related hazards caused by corrosion such as pollution of supply water, collapse of buildings and factories, and so on.

HOW IT CAN BE PREVENTED

Like death and taxes, corrosion is something we hope to avoid, but ultimately it is something we must learn to deal with. Corrosion usually originates at the surface of the metal. Therefore successful corrosion control methods ranges from painting the surface of steel or galvanising it to high-tech laser-surface melting. Corrosion can be controlled if we educate ourselves regarding this issue. It requires long-term thinking about the life-cycle of a structure. Mass awareness about corrosion will make a major impact in preserving environment and resources, as well as protecting ourselves and our fellow human beings.",2017-04-23 18:00:00,https://thedailystar.net/supplements/what-you-should-know-about-corrosion-1395622,2023-05-18 10:26:19,thedailystar

The SC handed down death penalty for Quader Mollah, also known as Butcher of Mirpur.

JAMAAT-SHIBIR MAYHEM OVER VERDICT MARCH 2013

Following the tribunal's verdict of death sentence on Delawar Hossain Sayedee on February 28, 2013, activists of Jamaat and its student body Islami Chhatra Shibir resorted to violence across the country, leaving at least 65 people dead and several hundred injured in just one week.

CONTROVERSY OVER TRIAL

The trial of the perpetrators of 1971 crimes drew criticism after the Skype scandal, leakage of draft of a war crimes verdict, defence witness going missing from tribunal's gate and contempt proceeding against several eminent persons.

Justice Nizamul Huq, the then chairman of Tribunal-1 resigned in December 2012 after Bangla daily Amar Desh published an alleged Skype conversation between him and Ahmed Ziauddin, an expatriate Bangladeshi.

On October 1, 2013, soon after the pronouncement of the verdict in the war crimes case against Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, his wife and family members showed “a copy of the verdict” to newsmen and claimed that it was leaked.

Later, tribunal authorities said part of the draft verdict was leaked and a Dhaka Court in September last year jailed a lawyer of Salauddin and four others over the leak.

Shukho Ranjan Bali, originally a prosecution witness in the case against Delawar Hossain Sayedee who later changed sides to testify for Sayedee, was allegedly abducted from the gate of the war crimes tribunal .

David Bergman, a Dhaka-based British journalist and Gonoshasthaya Kendra founder Zafrullah Chowdhury, among others, faced contempt proceeding for their write-ups and statements over the trial.

The Supreme Court on March 27 last year convicted Food Minister Qamrul Islam and Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Huq and fined them Tk 50,000 each for contempt of court through contemptuous and derogatory comments about Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha.

The ministers faced contempt proceeding after they criticised the CJ, after the top judge of the country expressed dissatisfaction over the “poor performance” of the prosecutors and investigators of war crimes tribunal in dealing with the case against Mir Quasem Ali.

396,Hundred Hours of Stillness,"When you are living in a chaotic city like Dhaka and working in a high-stakes job, stillness, more often than not, seems like the most precious commodity.

By stillness, I do not just mean the absence of noise and movement around you; it also means a pause in your thoughts and inner dialogue. The body benefits from movement, but the mind benefits from stillness.

So, every year, in pursuit of stillness, in pursuit of clarity, in pursuit of balance, in pursuit of tranquillity, I take off for Nepal for at least a fortnight.

My sanctuary of choice this year was Atmashree Yoga Retreat in Pokhara.

Being a yoga practitioner for more than a decade, I felt the need to level my understanding of the discipline that has captivated hundreds and thousands worldwide. So, I decided to do a 100-hour yoga course, which involved a yoga trek and intensive Asana sessions.

I am so glad that I made this choice as I returned with a deeper appreciation for self-care -- body, mind and spirit — in a safe, nurturing environment and a need to make space for stillness in my day-to-day life.

When I arrived at Atmashree Yoga Retreat on a hilltop on a balmy April evening, I immediately felt tranquil.

Flickering candle flames were punctuating the darkness, and the chirping of crickets, the soft rustling of leaves and the whoosh of the cool breeze provided the soundtrack. It felt so far removed from my bustling life in Dhaka. What was even better is that I did not need to step out of my spacious room to take in the sights, sounds and smells as my room had a big window.

Dinner was a completely vegetarian fare cooked with little oil and spice, setting us up for the fortnight of resetting our minds, bodies and souls. After a breezy walk around the retreat, I was in bed by 9 pm, excited to start my intensive asana course.

The course started at 6AM, with a 30-minute silent walk to a nearby hill. Silent walking is a morning meditation through which you can connect with your mind. You just need to follow your breath while walking silently.

Once we got to the top of the hill, we sat in silence for 15 minutes, completely at one with nature and the surroundings. And just like that, all my stress, self-doubts and restlessness disappeared. This is the stillness that I was seeking.

After a refreshment pitstop at the retreat, our morning yoga session started at 7:45AM. During this session, the instructor demonstrated various asanas and sun salutations and taught us the benefits of each posture. It was an intensive session that lasted until 9:30AM when breakfast was served. Breakfast was fruits and vegetable khichdi with organic ghee.

The next class was from 11AM to 12PM. It was by Hardik Mehta, a yoga trainer from India. He not only taught me yoga postures but also the psychology and benefits behind each asana.

From 12PM to 1PM, we practised Yoga Nidra, a technique for connecting with our subconscious mind and inner selves. This practice can help reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, increase self-awareness and enhance creativity.

Additionally, Yoga Nidra has healing benefits, and research indicates that just 30 minutes of this yoga practice can be equivalent to four hours of sleep. It was so relaxing that I fell asleep during the practice.

After lunch, the next class started at 6PM, where the instructor taught us intense postures to improve our flexibility. This session lasted for an hour, after which we had a one-hour break to sit out in the open field and chat with our fellow yogis.

At 6PM, I attended another yoga class focused on balancing movements, which was designed to develop strength. Overall, the yoga classes were a great way to spend my day.

We had dinner from 7PM to 8PM. From 8PM to 9PM, we participated in an evening meditation session that focused on increasing concentration, also known as Focused Attention Meditation (FAM). This meditation style involves focusing your attention on an object, sound or sensation, instead of trying to achieve a clear mind without a specific focal point.

We often used a candle flame as our focal point, and sometimes we played instruments or local songs to enhance the experience. The whole atmosphere was magical and left us feeling rejuvenated.

After the evening meditation, we went to bed at 9PM. This was my routine for the 10 days at Atmashree Yoga Retreat.

On the 11th day, we went on a trek to Poon Hill, popularly known as Annapurna Sunrise Trekking or Annapurna Panorama Trekking. Anyone who loves yoga, meditation, nature and beautiful landscape will never forget this astounding experience.

It was bright and sunny when we set out, meandering through the beautiful ethnic villages of the Annapurna region and rhododendron forests.

The weather was great until lunchtime the next day when it started pouring. I did not have a raincoat with me, but my fellow trekkers improvised and managed a makeshift raincoat to shield me from the rain and catch a cold. I felt so grateful to be surrounded by such resourceful and caring people.

We stayed at a cosy rest house for the night. The next morning, we started our trek with walking sticks in tow, as the ascent from here onwards would be steeper. It was a physically exhausting climb, more so for those with not the best fitness.

But all of our sufferings were forgotten when we reached the peak, which was 3,210 meters above sea level. We were greeted with snowfall. It was an awe-inspiring, divine sight, and we took the time to meditate and soak it all in. The whole experience was unforgettable.

However, as we began our descent, we realised that coming down from the hill was even more difficult than climbing up. Our muscles began to ache, and we were reminded of the true physical challenge of our trek. We eventually made it back to Atmashree Yoga Retreat in one piece.

I woke up early the next day to take in the magnetic surroundings of the Atmashree Yoga Retreat for one last time before my departure. I sat down in the open field, closed my eyes, listened to the soft rustling of leaves and the whoosh of the breeze, and went into a trance. When I opened my eyes, the morning light was shining bright. What a restorative experience this place provided.

Saying goodbye to all the amazing fellow yogis, teachers and friends at Atmashree the next morning was certainly tough. The memories and lessons of this yoga retreat will stay with me for a lifetime, one I will try to practice every day.

397,Bornomala: A calligraphy and typography exhibition by KrayonMag,"The three-day long exhibition, 'Bornomala' started at the Liberation War Museum in Agargaon, Dhaka on 12 May, 2023 mentioned a press release. This was yet another endeavour by KrayonMag, a distinctive publishing and social storytelling platform in Bangladesh.

Out of deep concern for all the lost alphabets of the world, KrayonMag strives to preserve the Bangladeshi alphabet out of respect. The 'Bornomala' exhibition was organised to display the script of different languages of Bangladesh (Bangla and the language of tribal communities) in the form of calligraphy, typography, and lettering.

Addressing the audience on the inaugural day, Salma Adil, CFO of ""Top Of Mind,"" stated that ""KrayonMag has been working for a long time to promote and spread the Bengali language. This Bornomala exhibition is another essential part of that endeavour. I believe that this endeavour would raise awareness of the Bengali language among our next generation.""

Knowing the correct use of the alphabet is essential for correct pronunciation and correct application of the language. Many languages are lost today due to lack of preservation of alphabets. In this context, author Selina Hossain said, ""We fought for our language and it is our responsibility to protect and preserve this language. The Bangla alphabet should not be lost due to lack of preservation. And KrayonMag should keep up this effort in the future days as well.""

Rebecca Sultana, project Officer of UNDP Bangladesh said, ""The alphabet exhibition brings the language alive in front of us. I would like KrayonMag to continue this in the future. Many other languages grow at the same pace as Bengali language. UNDP is happy to be a partner of this event.""

Various artists from Bangladesh and India participated in Bornomala exhibition including Arup Baul, Jannatul Ferdous, Shubhra Dhar, Abdul Baten Sarkar, Manowar Hussain Shah, Md Morsalin bin Kashem, Obaidullah Omar, Upal Roy Chowdhury, Mehnaz Tabassum, among others.

Sustainable fashion activist, artist Faiza Ahmed participated in this event with her art collection. A collection of her saris was arranged across a part of Gallery 6 of the Liberation War Museum. The saris featured calligraphy of different colours.

398,“Blood Sweat and Tears”: Sami Alam's ode to fashion’s unsung heroes,"The fashion world is viewed as exclusively luxurious and glamorous by the masses. But there's more than meets the eye. The US $1.53 trillion industry has a larger share of workers whose working and living conditions are far from the onscreen glamour.

Bangladesh is the second largest garment exporter in the world. Our RMG workers have served global fashion needs at the cost of little to no benefits in their lives. They are regularly exploited with poor salaries that do not match the rising cost and inflation in the economy, the lack of employee benefits, the dearth of security, and many more.

Sami Alam, an aspiring fashion designer, decided to use his penchant for fashion to tell the story of these workers and highlight their unacknowledged labour. He designed the thought-provoking collection ""Blood, Sweat and Tears"" for his Master's graduation at International Fashion Academy (IFA) in Paris, France.

Who is Sami Alam?

Sami Alam, the fashion designer, started his career in 2016 at Aarong — the biggest and most influential fashion house in Bangladesh. He worked as a designer for the export department of Aarong before designing for Aarong's upscale and high-end sub-brand HERSTORY starting in 2017.

Becoming a fashion designer

""From my childhood, I really loved to draw and paint, but it was never explored academically and remained more of a hobby,"" said Sami. While pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) at United International University (UIU), he started learning French at Alliance Francaise de Dhaka. Out of curiosity, he participated in the creative blog writing and design competition ""Allons en France (Let's Go to France).

After winning the competition in 2010 and going on a cultural exposure trip to France, Alam came back home and with the blessings of his family, left UIU and pursued a Bachelor of Fashion Design Technology at Shanto Mariam University, graduating in 2015.

Afterwards, in 2022, he went on to receive a Master's in Contemporary Fashion Design from International Fashion Academy (IFA) in Paris. He completed a semester on exchange at Istituto Lorenzo de' Medici in Italy, studying courses on Fashion Styling, Fashion Cross Culture and Fashion Business.

His academic zeal took him to one of the most prestigious fashion schools in the world, Central Saint Martins, which boasts alumni such as Alexander McQueen and John Galliano. Sami completed two short courses on Fashion Creative Direction and Fashion Film at this esteemed institution.

""Blood, Sweat and Tears""

As part of his Master's programme, Sami had to design a graduation collection. He wanted to reflect on the history of garment manufacturing in our country. ""We serve as a manufacturer of these clothes which is something to be proud of. Looking back at the history, I found this process hasn't been fair to us. People got injured, suffered, and died. We paid for fashion with blood, sweat, and tears,"" noted Sami.

Hence, his collection perpetuated the notion of a safe and fair working environment through sustainability, to all the workers involved in the global fashion supply chain, both at home and abroad.

In his words, ""It is not a disregard towards the improvements that have taken place in the past few years, but rather a push towards better working conditions and a reminder that we still have a long way to go.""

It is an exploration of the concept of showing the fashion industry through the lens of an RMG worker. As stated by Sami, ""No human life should be cheaper than clothes. No one in the world should suffer, be injured, or die for fashion.""

Sami brought his message to life and motion by creating three acts within the collection. The acts, Confrontation, Tragedy, and Aftermath work in harmony to create a flow of the story. Confrontation evokes the acuity of the factory workers. The opening look starts with the slogan on the outfit 'We make your clothes.'

The second act, Tragedy, recalls the dreadful memories of the Tazreen Fashion fire in 2012 and the Rana Plaza collapse of 2013. The clothes portrayed the post-catastrophic visuals as a symbolic interpretation of the grim reality and the true cost of the clothes we wear. The final act, Aftermath, concludes the collection with the message 'No more death for fashion.'

The collection has 17 looks featuring an array of dresses; some hooded, along with skirts, tops, jackets, shirts, crop tops, shorts, high-waisted bottoms, and a sari. The clothes have been emblazoned with slogans that resonate, such as ""Fashion kills"", ""Inhumane working environment"", ""Our lives are cheaper than clothes"", and many more.

The colour scheme heavily features red, synonymous with the blood of the garment workers lost to tragedies. Various shades of denim bind the collection with cameo appearances of white and black.

The collection was shown on the runway at Le Salon des Miroirs in Paris.

Keeping sustainability at the forefront, the entire collection has been constructed using upcycled materials. Sami made excellent use of recycled saris, denim pants, end of roll fabrics from Aarong, alongside factory waste trims and accessories.

Regarding the techniques used, Sami said, ""I explored many experimental techniques to create the design language I wanted, including contemporising traditional Bangladeshi kantha stitch to create the blood vein texture, burning denim and compiling them together with single taaga stitches, typography using different textiles, using twill-tapes to create a fabric, utilising waste trims and accessories to create a picture on the garment and many more.""

Looking forward to the future

When asked about the future, Sami expressed his desire to keep working for Aarong. ""I consider my schooling of Bangladeshi heritage and culture rooted here (Aarong) and it guided me to be the designer I always wanted to be,"" stated Sami. He also plans to work in fashion education in Bangladesh. His ultimate dream is to bring all the stakeholders of the industry in Bangladesh to unified excellence on the world map by sharing education and knowledge.",2023-05-14 11:14:58,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/blood-sweat-and-tears-sami-alams-ode-fashions-unsung-heroes-3319796,2023-05-18 10:26:54,thedailystar
399,Activism through art,"How this one artist is using their creativity to drive social change and spark meaningful conversations about pressing issues.

Throughout the ages, art has always been a powerful form of expression, capable of provoking thought and bringing change. It has always been a powerful tool for activism and as such, artists have always used their creativity and imagination to shed light on many social, economic, and environmental issues around us. Today, we will be talking about one such individual who has dedicated his life to such thoughtful and empowering artworks, using his talent to drive social change.

Abdullah Al Morshed or Morshed Mishu as he's commonly known, is a Bangladeshi cartoonist, illustrator, cover artist, and graffiti artist. He has been working as a cartoonist professionally since 2012 and is the current Assistant Editor of the monthly satire magazine, Unmad. He has garnered worldwide attention with his prolific artwork addressing social, political, and environmental issues.

When asked about how art can promote social change, he said that art is merely a tool that helps deliver the idea of change to the masses. Change takes time and there are things in history that were right then but are not right anymore. So, to motivate people to bring about this change, art helps to make people believe in how the changes can help them.

Photo: Collected

He referred to his famous work in ""The Global Happiness Challenge"" where he envisioned a world without war and catastrophe. ""The idea for The Global Happiness Challenge was simple"" Morshed stated, adding, ""Instead of all the suffering and death and sadness, what would those scenarios look like if war didn't happen, this vision is what I wanted to show people.""

He also brought up his drawing of the sensational Bangladesh women's football team when they returned home after winning the SAFF Women's Championship. He depicted them on a roofless bus, smiling and waving to the crowd, much like the rituals you see abroad. ""I can't give them a literal bus, but I can still show the people of Bangladesh what it could look like through my drawing,"" said Morshed.

Morshed Mishu always takes the opportunity to illustrate his imagination through art on most social issues. Be it political or environmental, anything that aligns with his philosophy, he is at arms to represent the pressing matter.

""Any issue that I personally feel connected to that is good for me, my family, and especially my country that I'm very passionate for, I draw to evoke some thoughts and inspire my fellow countrymen,"" elaborated Morshed.

When it comes to his thought process on creating artwork, he always keeps it simple. ""I ask myself five basic questions; what, where, how, why, and when."" This seemingly small step helps him uncover a lot more answers about the issue or cause than expected. He says since he is just a common person, he tries to think from that perspective, adding to his own personal feelings towards the subject and approaches his work accordingly.",2023-05-14 11:10:35,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/activism-through-art-3319791,2023-05-18 10:26:55,thedailystar
400,Kanak Chanpa Chakma: Portrait of an artist,"Given the heights of the art world she has reached, it is obvious that her name follows a long list of prestigious accolades and exhibitions in Bangladesh and abroad. Let us, then, not even go there. But if we mention just one — the very fact that Kanak Chanpa Chakma is an Ekushey Padak recipient this year, one of the highest civilian honours of the country, speaks volumes about her work.

Hence, we met up with her recently to explore her work and life at large – to capture the portrait of the artist herself.

As soon as you enter her home and studio, you will immediately feel that this is indeed the space of an artist, particularly that of Kanak Chanpa Chakma. A canvas depicting a woman of an indigenous community in Bangladesh – her signature theme — stares back at you. Stacks of paintings lie here and there. Buddha statues adorn her house. Blobs of paint have made their mark on the floor. Several cats lazily sit around the cosy home.

Amidst all that, an amicable Kanak Chanpa Chakma welcomes you.

Over a birthday cake (it was her birthday the day before), we begun.

""When I close my eyes, my mind takes me back to the Chittagong Hill Tracts, where I was born and brought up. As I stand in front of the canvas, I feel an urge to work on that part of my life,"" she replied as to why she ardently portrays indigenous people in her paintings.

Hailing from Rangamati, she saw the beauty, joys, and sorrows of the people in the region, and as an artist, she passionately and boldly stuck to her roots.

The result of which, I reckon, was the development of her own style, surrounding a rather unique theme.

It is not that other artists before her never attempted to depict the culture and lifestyle of various indigenous societies in Bangladesh, but I would opine that what makes her work special is the scale, depth, and volume she has offered to the audience. In all beauty, she has presented the lives of indigenous peoples to the whole of Bangladesh and beyond the country's borders as well.

Females from indigenous communities frequently come to life on her canvas. ""I see women as Durga,"" she said. ""I portray them as a symbol of strength. I do not want to see them as neglected or weak. They are often the central characters of my paintings. Through my work, I want to tell their stories, contributions, and their dreams and feelings.""

Whilst doing that, she has also put forth a wide range of aspects – sights of the beautiful hill tracts, fashion, and so on.

To illustrate, a woman is seen in her traditional garb. Sometimes, she is carrying a basket on her back. She may fancy a flower tucked in her hair. Jewellery of various shapes and forms adorn her further — bangles, necklaces, earrings, etc. — all with a touch of the elegance and uniqueness of her culture.

""Some people may say that this is for times of festivities. But even in their daily lives, women like to wear ornaments and traditional dresses,"" she explains. ""Of course, during festivals and celebrations, they can take things further, but I have seen my grandmothers donning rather large nose pins regularly and when going about their regular work and chores.""

And flowers too. ""Let's say a woman is going to work, and she comes across some beautiful flowers. She'll simply pluck one off and put it in her hair. It is a very common sight,"" the artist described.

She feels that there are numerous stories and a huge wealth of information to be presented about the indigenous communities of our country, lamenting that a lifetime is not enough to portray all of that.

""There is so much diversity in Bangladesh! Diversity enriches a country. They say that a garden does not look very nice with just one kind of flower. A garden is richer when there are many different kinds of flowers, instead of just one type,"" she said.

And she added, remembering her deceased husband (notable filmmaker Khalid Mahmood Mithu), that he was a huge support in her life and career, and that he inspired her to go very deep into the hill tracts to further explore the cultures of the region.

On the other hand, the theme of Buddhism also sometimes appears in Kanak Chanpa Chakma's artworks. For her, it is not religion per se.

""With this line of paintings, I essentially want to represent peace,"" she elaborated. ""As a child, I used to see groups of monks come out and collect food in very early mornings. The sun is just rising. The monks are clothed in orange garbs. A splendid play of colours! Such illumination! One cannot express in words the beauty of that scene. It is only possible to show it visually.""

On a separate note, as an artist, she is a morning person. That is when she prefers to work, contrary to the popular belief that creative people usually work late nights. She is an artist, not detached or isolated from reality at all, hence breaking yet another baseless cliché for you!

In fact, she finds herself busy with many endeavours. For example, she is the founding president of Ethnic Art Foundation Bangladesh, an organisation that provides support and platform to indigenous artists of various fields.

Meanwhile, from acid survivors to the third gender population to autistic children to rescue animals, she is involved in tackling a diverse range of issues that our society faces.

And surrounding all these is of course her extraordinary career as an artist, earning her numerous awards, including the recent Ekushey Padak.

Sharing her thoughts on it, Kanak Chanpa Chakma said, ""My country has officially given me this recognition. It is a matter of huge joy. As a painter belonging to an indigenous community receiving this award, this shall be a source of inspiration for the next generations. I feel that my responsibility has increased. There is a long way to go and there is so much more to do!""",2023-05-14 10:55:36,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/kanak-chanpa-chakma-portrait-artist-3319776,2023-05-18 10:26:57,thedailystar

A Nigerian chef has spent 100 hours preparing meals non-stop, aiming to set a Guinness World Record for the longest ever cooking session by an individual.

Hilda Bassey, a chef in the mega city of Lagos, has captivated the country with her marathon cooking, which started on Thursday and ended on Monday night.

President Muhammadu Buhari and several politicians and celebrities congratulated Bassey, while cheering supporters camped outside an event's centre to witness the 27-year-old chef preparing a mix of local and foreign dishes, from jollof rice to pasta and akara, which is made from bean flour.

The current longest cooking record is held by Indian chef Lata Tondon, who set a time of 87 hours and 45 minutes in 2019.

Bassey's time will need to be certified by Guinness World Record officials before it can be made official.",2023-05-16 15:30:49,https://www.thedailystar.net/lifestyle/news/after-100-hours-non-stop-cooking-nigerian-chef-seeks-world-record-3321791,2023-05-18 10:26:59,thedailystar
403,Guide for new mums,"Dealing with all the chores that accompany being a new mother can be stressful. It adds a new depth to our lives. It's understandable to question, ""Am I doing this right?""

When you are thinking about putting together a series of questions, it's sometimes not immediately clear where to start. Understanding some best practices can make things a lot easier. With that in mind, here are some facts straight from Dr Farhana Afroze MBBS, MPH, Senior medical officer, Popular medical college hospital regarding any new mother's most frequently asked questions.

What is the importance of breastfeeding?

Breastfeeding or breast milk in any quantity is good for your child. A small amount of colostrum, or first breast milk, is beneficial for your infant. The initial breast milk contains more than just nutrients; it also has antibodies and other immune-boosting characteristics. It is much more beneficial to continue breastfeeding after the infant stage. Breastfeeding can reduce your child's chances of developing asthma, allergies, diabetes, and certain cancers in the distant future. It may also lower your risk of developing ovarian and breast cancer.

Which is preferred, breast milk or formula?

Whether you feed your baby breast milk or formula is entirely up to you. If you choose formula, bear in mind that it is designed to provide new-borns with a source of nutrients. A baby's best source of nourishment is breast milk. It provides the perfect ratio of fat, protein, and carbohydrates. And as your child grows, they change throughout each feeding as well as over the months.

How often should bottles and pacifiers be sanitised?

If your infant is younger than two months, was born preterm, or has a compromised immune system, disinfecting meals daily or more frequently is crucial. Older, healthy babies may not need to their utensils santised daily if they are carefully washed after each use.

Should sleeping babies be woken to feed?

New-borns wake up every several hours to be fed. Breastfed babies drink frequently, every 2-3 hours. Bottle-fed babies drink less frequently, usually every 3-4 hours. New-borns who sleep for extended periods should be woken up to drink. Wake your baby every 3-4 hours to drink until he or she gains weight, which normally occurs within the first several weeks. After that, your infant can sleep for longer amounts of time at night.

How to clean a baby's stump?

After your baby is born, their umbilical cord is cut, but a small portion remains, which is supposed to fall off naturally within 5-15 days. During this period, use a cotton swab, cotton square, or cotton round to wipe the stump or umbilical cord's base with clean water in a safe manner. Keep in mind that the diaper should not cover the chord region because it needs to be kept dry and clean at all times.

Is it a problem to carry your baby too much?

Contrary to common assumption, research demonstrates that there is no such thing as ""too much"" holding of a baby. While some people believe that holding a baby can make them clingy or demanding, studies show that rather than spoiling, holding a baby helps to reduce stress.

Should parents share a bed with their baby?

Put a bassinet, play yard, or crib next to your bed to keep your infant close. The risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is reduced when a new-born sleeps in a different area in the same room as the mother. You can also think about getting a bedside sleeper, which attaches to your mattress and allows you and your baby to be close but still on different surfaces.

Should they start with vegetables and fruits for their babies?

It's crucial to introduce veggies before fruits. When your baby first starts eating, you should also introduce one different puree every two to three days so that your baby can get used to the new flavours and you can keep an eye out for any allergic responses.",2023-05-13 10:13:47,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/guide-new-mums-3318776,2023-05-18 10:27:01,thedailystar
404,Transcending Boundaries: Pritom Hasan's 'Deora' in Coke Studio Bangla,"Amidst the timeless tapestry of music, where tradition meets innovation, Pritom Hasan emerges as a maestro who fearlessly traverses uncharted territories. In his latest Coke Studio endeavour, ""Deora"", he weaves together the threads of Bangla folk genres, urban grooves, and even draws inspiration from the anime realm. With Pritom Hasan's distinctive musical vision, we embark on a rhythmic odyssey that transcends borders and defies expectations.

The crowd-favourite musician has yet again shown his take on music through Coke Studio Bangla's song, Deora. The hit song was launched last Sunday night across all of its digital platforms, presenting high energy. When asked about his process of coming up with this song, Pritom replied, ""Deora combines Bangla folk genres 'Shaari', 'Jaari', and 'Pala Gaan' with explosive urban grooves. I signified it with the outfit I wore in the Deora music video, the Jonin Vest, which originated from the anime, Naruto.

""Deora"" is dedicated to the boatsmen's rhythm and enthusiasm during the 'Nouka Baich' or traditional boat race, popular in rural Bangladesh and held throughout the monsoon and fall seasons, and was composed, produced, mixed, and mastered by Pritom Hasan. ""I took inspiration from the style of Kanye West and the band Queens, the performance took a lot of physical movement,"" added the musician.

The title of the song relates to 'brother-in-law' in the regional dialect of north Bengal, and this type of song is performed from the banks of rivers during boat races, cheering on the racers.

The song's biggest surprise has been Islam Uddin Palakar's outstanding performance, who is well-known in the 'Pala Gaan' tradition of Bangla folk songs. ""The rich heritage of this genre usually necessitates elaborative theatrical performances in which the actor takes on multiple roles—sometimes as a man, sometimes as a woman, and sometimes as an inanimate object—to tell stories to their audience. These shows can last up to 8 hours without a break.""

The lyrics were co-written by Pritom and Fazlu Majhi, a boat racer who also sang in the song with his team. Armeen Musa, the first Bangladeshi Grammy Award nominee, and her 'Ghaashphoring Choir' provided a new dimension to the song.

As the euphonic journey of ""Deora"" comes to an end, the listeners have been fascinated by the combination of talent and legacy. Pritom Hasan's determination to retain the integrity of Bangla folk while infusing it with current vigour gives the musical landscape a fresh lease on life.

""Deora"" becomes an ode to the resilient spirit of boat racers and an encouragement to embrace the power of narrative through song, thanks to Islam Uddin Palakar's memorable performance and the transforming contributions of Fazlu Majhi, Armeen Musa, and the Ghaashphoring Choir. With his unwavering devotion to the invention, Pritom Hasan continues to push the frontiers of music, leaving us eagerly awaiting his next masterpiece.",2023-05-13 10:01:33,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/transcending-boundaries-pritom-hasans-deora-coke-studio-bangla-3318721,2023-05-18 10:27:02,thedailystar
405,Introducing Linguaskill: Revolutionising English language proficiency assessment in Bangladesh,"English language proficiency plays a vital role in the corporate and higher education sectors in Bangladesh. To address the need for standardised assessment, Linguaskill, developed by Cambridge University Press and Assessment, has been introduced in the country. This cutting-edge tool utilises industry-leading artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate English language skills comprehensively, providing a score, CEFR grade, and detailed reports on candidates' abilities in speaking, writing, listening, and reading. Linguaskill offers organisations and individuals the opportunity to gauge language competency effectively, identify strengths and areas for improvement, and make informed decisions regarding recruitment, training, and admission processes.

Cambridge has designed Linguaskill to be highly adaptable, allowing organisations to seamlessly integrate it into their recruitment, training, and admission processes. Becoming a Linguaskill venue empowers organisations to administer the exam in-house, streamlining the evaluation process. Alternatively, individuals can choose to take the exam either face-to-face at the Cambridge exam centre (Englishology BD266) or remotely from the comfort of their own homes. Remote exams utilise a state-of-the-art proctoring system that employs AI to detect and prevent any malpractice, ensuring the integrity of the assessment.

Linguaskill offers two distinct options: General and Business. This flexibility enables organisations to select the language variant that aligns with their objectives. Linguaskill Business assesses English proficiency in a corporate and business context, making it suitable for recruitment in organisations where employees are expected to be well-versed in the business language. On the other hand, Linguaskill General focuses on language skills required in daily life, making it an excellent choice for university admission, job recruitment in non-business environments, and situations where strong English skills are necessary but specialist business terminology is not.

Englishology, the authorised agent and examination centre of Cambridge University Press and Assessment in Bangladesh, takes charge of managing Linguaskill in the country. Sabiha Ashalata, Business Development Lead at Englishology, believes that Linguaskill has the potential to revolutionise the way English language proficiency is assessed in the corporate and higher education sectors. As an experienced English language teaching and assessment specialist, Sabiha is optimistic about the positive impact this accessible English test from Cambridge will have on English language teaching and learning in Bangladesh.

The arrival of Linguaskill in Bangladesh marks a significant milestone in standardising English language assessment in the corporate and higher education sectors. With its advanced AI technology, comprehensive reporting, and adaptable testing options, Linguaskill empowers organisations to make informed decisions about candidates' communication skills. Additionally, it helps individuals identify their strengths and areas for improvement. By offering tailored assessments, Linguaskill ensures that language proficiency evaluations align with specific objectives. As Bangladesh embraces this transformative tool, it is poised to enhance English language teaching and learning, ultimately contributing to the growth and success of individuals and organisations in the country.",2023-05-13 09:30:47,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/introducing-linguaskill-revolutionising-english-language-proficiency-assessment-bangladesh-3318686,2023-05-18 10:27:03,thedailystar
406,Workin’ Moms: 5 things you can learn from the Netflix series,"Popular Netflix series Workin' Moms has come out with its final season and those who have religiously followed the lives of Kate Foster and her group of mum friends are sorry to see it end. Full of light-hearted and dark humour, and a host of inappropriate antics, the show is more than just a hoot and a laugh.

Here are 5 things that Workin' Moms can teach you — even if you are not a mum.

Girl clans are important

If there's one thing this painfully relatable series can teach you, it is the importance of a girl clan. Time and again, these friends are put in situations that threaten their work, rock their personal relationships, or make them question their decisions. At each stage, the friends have come through for one another- buoying each other up, holding hands through scary times, and understanding the struggles of one another more acutely.

Being genuine is better than being nice

Kate, Anne, and the rest of the gang rarely have much peace at a stretch. The overwhelmingly honest show regularly throws its leads in testy situations where they have to navigate their personal and professional lives. They often find themselves juggling biases, feeling overconfident or even in denial about things, and more often than not, the show has one or more friends giving the other a reality check. While this may feel blunt, or painful even, not once has the check been given rudely or with malintent.

Life is not a well-scheduled plan

Working mothers will agree that sticking to plans is as important as oxygen, but life rarely shows any respect for painstakingly made schedules. Babies will fall sick, teenagers will act out, and partners and friends will fall out right before a work deadline. Despite everything, the girls manage to bounce back and work out a Plan B for themselves and so can you.

You can do it all, but not all at once

Mostly all the female leads in this show have high-flying careers or problems at work. Kate runs her own PR firm, Anne is a psychiatrist, Sloane is a coveted book publisher, and Jenny is struggling to keep her job. Despite that, they manage to have wholesome moments with their children and/or partners, but not without support. While at some point in their lives, they all feel as if they can juggle it all, life shows them how to navigate each slump and high with grace.

You are not perfect

As strong individuals who have members of the family looking up to us, we often make the mistake of holding ourselves to a ridiculously high standard. Humans (including mothers) make mistakes, but uncomfortable as they are, there is not one mistake that does not come with a lesson. The series normalises difficult situations between parents and children, and brings to its viewers, a fair share of gut-wrenching realisations, apologies, and opportunities for tough growth.",2023-05-13 09:22:49,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/workin-moms-5-things-you-can-learn-the-netflix-series-3318676,2023-05-18 10:27:05,thedailystar
407,Love notes from children to their mother,"Celebrating mother’s day with a compilation of love notes from children.

For most of us, our mothers are our rocks. They are the light that guide us home and life will just not make sense without them. There is a lot that we want to say to our mums but because of life, we hardly ever get the chance to express our emotions the way we would want to. However, with Mother's Day just around the corner, we wanted to give people on the internet the opportunity to share these thoughts and feelings and write a love note to their mothers. Here are a few of them:

Note # 1

""Dear Mum,

I wanted to write this letter to tell you that you were always right about life. I apologise for all the times I argued with you. I didn't know any better but I do now and I know that you always wanted what's best for me. Now that I am a mum myself, I know exactly how you felt and where you came from during our arguments.

Mum, I love you so, so much. Even though I have to act mature and all grown up, I am still and forever will be your little silly girl. The girl who used to tag along with you everywhere you went and thought the world of you growing up. Thank you for all the amazing memories and for all the things you taught me. Thank you for the hair braiding, the late-night stories and letting me attempt to do your makeup! I really miss those wonderful days and I really miss you Mum.

I love you now and forever Mum.

Your silly little girl""

Note # 2

""Dearest Ma,

I hardly ever confess this, but I love you so very, very much. You have always loved me with everything you had. No matter what I did, your love for me never went away.

I always wonder what makes you so selfless. You always got up early at the crack of dawn to help me get ready. You never got angry when I made a fuss when I didn't get what I wanted. I was so naive back then to understand your sacrifices. Thank you for bearing with me all this time Ma.

I'm so happy that we are such good friends, in fact you're one of my best friends. I can talk to you about everything going on in my life knowing that you'll never judge me and always will support me. Thank you for being the world's greatest Ma. I love you very much""

Note # 3

""Dear Maa,

Thank you for never letting Baba find out that I smoke. Thank you for always covering for me when I lied. Thank you for always believing in me (even when no one else did) and standing up for me. I know I have not been the best person and more importantly the best son but the older I grow, the more I realize that it is your belief in me that keeps me going and makes me want to be the best I can be. I hope I can make up for all the excuses that you have had to make for me. I hope I can repay you for the belief and make you proud. You deserve all the happiness in the world and then some. I love you, Ammu. More than you will ever know""

Note # 4

""Dearest Ammu,

You are the most selfless person I know. You are the bravest, the most kind hearted, the most passionate and most persistent person I know. You also make the best custard in the world. And the best polao-korma, in fact the best everything in the world. I can go on for hours talking about how amazing you are, Ammu. But the truth is that there are not enough words to help me do that. So, I'll just end by telling you that you are my everything and I love you a lot. Happy Mother's Day, Ma""

Note # 5

""To my best friend,

I have never had to worry about making friends throughout my life because I have always had you. I have never had to worry about pursuing anything in life because I always had my support. Be it arts & crafts, sports, photography or cooking, you never had a problem with my ever-changing passions. You are my biggest cheerleader and support system. You taught me to always follow my heart and I am where I am today because you have always made me feel like I can conquer the world. It hurts to be thousands of miles away from you, especially on Mother's Day. But I know that as soon as the clock hits 12 in Bangladesh, I will get a call from you wishing me on Mother's Day, it should be the other way around, Ma. I love you to bits""",2023-05-13 09:14:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/love-notes-children-their-mother-3318666,2023-05-18 10:27:06,thedailystar
408,How credible are your research sources?,"It might come as an unpleasant shock to some, but you actually need to research the research you want to cite. While ""trust the science"" has become an unofficial motto in a post-pandemic world, like the humans that produced them, they're not infallible.

Research usually falls into two categories – qualitative (non-numerical data collection) and quantitative (numerical data collection). The quality criteria for qualitative research are credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability. Quality criteria used in quantitative investigations are internal validity, external validity, reliability, and objectivity. While the factors determining their legitimacy differ, the core principles are the same.

Purpose

The purpose of the study itself will influence its methodology, and its result by extension. This is even more applicable to qualitative research, where there's more room for human interference.

Author

It's necessary to determine whether the people who conducted the research had the relevant expertise for it. Checking the source of funding is a good option in this case.

Industry-sponsored studies tend to be biased towards providing favourable results of the sponsor's products. A famous example is Coca-Cola's history of funding scientists who downplay the risks of sugary beverages on obesity.

Bias

Selection bias is a common phenomenon that occurs when the researcher includes or excludes relevant groups or data while conducting the study. People volunteering (self-selecting) for the study will also lead to highly skewed results, for instance, online surveys. Interpreting information in a way that fits a preconceived hypothesis, known as confirmation bias, has been observed in political, financial, and organisational contexts and research is no different.

This is why it's important to observe who is conducting the research, as their interests might influence their conclusions. Design bias happens when the structure of the study is flawed. You can usually see this type of bias in flawed research questions.

Sample size

A small sample size likely won't be representative of the larger population. This is why large sample sizes are heavily preferred in quantitative experiments.

On the other hand, qualitative investigations can get away with relatively smaller samples, since each respondent will likely yield a lot of information to be analysed.

Methodology

For qualitative experiments, you should check whether multiple data sources and methods were used or not and whether the participants had enough time to answer the questions.

For quantitative studies, internal validity needs to be scrutinised. Internal validity refers to how accurately results reflect the studied group. This means having control groups and a sufficient sample size.

Peer-reviewed articles are generally considered trustworthy since it adds another layer of quality control.

Transferability

When the study passes all other checkpoints, it's time to ponder the most important question – does the conclusion apply to your context? For example, the results of a study measuring stress levels of high school students in Germany cannot necessarily apply to students in Bangladesh.

It's important to note that using unreliable sources can make your work less credible by association. Aside from ethics, blindly following research without fact-checking can also influence your personal life, especially considering how quickly misinformation goes viral on social media. Healthy scepticism is celebrated even in the scientific world, so why not practise it?

409,Public libraries could solve our public space problem,"Imagine it's noon and you're wandering around Dhaka under the scorching heat in search of a quiet place to work or study. You're hoping to find a quiet environment where you can focus on completing your homework for the day and maybe get some reading done as well. The noise from the nearby construction site is inhibiting the peace at home, making it impossible for you to concentrate there. Your only other option is to go to a cafe, but you don't want to spend the last of your weekly allowance on overpriced coffee just to get a seat.

In times like this, you desperately wished that there was a well-equipped public library in Dhaka that you could frequent. And that is me. Growing up in Dhaka, I have always felt the need for a public library for various reasons.

In the increasingly privatised and neoliberal societies that we live in, public spaces are becoming scarce. The existing libraries in Dhaka fail to ensure the availability of diverse reading materials essential to engage readers of all ages, backgrounds, and interests like me. I have always found the existing ones to cater to only specific groups of people, mostly individuals preparing for the BCS or other public exams.

Although this is a great example of how resourceful public libraries are, it also reveals the issue with the existing ones – it's not catering to the demands of young people like me. The absence of a rich collection of reading materials and research content renders a library meaningless, which is why most libraries in Dhaka are in a sorry state.

Thus, there needs to be a push for a strong public library culture in Dhaka.

Firstly, the existing public libraries must stock the shelves with the latest books. Secondly, it must ensure that it's catering to people of all socio-economic classes.

One of my favourite accounts on Instagram is the Milwaukee Public Library account. Its key feature is that it's marketing a strong public library culture to its audience through funny and relatable content, mostly memes and reels. This sends a message across to the audience that public libraries can be a fun place too.

A similar marketing approach can be introduced here as it's a creative way to get more people to use libraries.

Let's break down the myth that young people don't read these days. Online bookstores are witnessing a surge in book sales indicating that young people want to read but want to do it on their terms. It reveals a trend that young people like accessibility and convenience when it comes to reading. By making public libraries more accessible and user-friendly, we can encourage more young readers to use them.

Public libraries can be a great equaliser, offering access to knowledge and resources that might be out of reach for many. Therefore, libraries must be easily accessible and welcoming to everyone.

With public spaces becoming increasingly scarce and the overall community well-being threatened, public libraries could play a crucial role in fostering a strong sense of community. It's high time that the public library culture in Dhaka gets a boost and becomes an integral part of the community.

410,Rethinking education and future skills,"Don’t you want to stay relevant?

The world is undergoing a loop of innovation and invention. Artificial intelligence, blockchain, NFTs, the ever-present diffusion of digital cultures, Internet of Things (IoT), and mixed reality-enabled communication are just the tip of the iceberg – knowledge essential for staying relevant. Whether in IT, business, science, economics, or art, knowledge gives one an advantage in the game of society and success.

But where does one gain knowledge in these areas?

From online tutorials and courses to formal higher education ecosystems, learning opportunities to stay relevant are no longer scarce. People fresh out of high school in Bangladesh are no longer limited to higher education in the proverbial sense, as higher education is no longer limited to national borders today.

Want to learn a new skill? Search it up on YouTube. Trying to get certified? Check out platforms like Udemy and Coursera. Besides, many global universities also offer bachelor's and master's programs online. Regardless of these options, nothing beats the experience of a university campus.

Of course, there are pros and cons to each of these approaches. Staying relevant translates to positive outcomes for people – most commonly in a job, business, or expanded opportunities. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a lot of meaning behind it.

Employers always look for the cream of the crop, and that does not necessarily go in favour of graduates from educational institutions that have long held the spot of being societal elites. An employer looks for well-built foundations in their hires – good communication capacity, foundational technical skills, ability to critically think and solve problems, being a doer, and of course having unique traits that they can utilise or find interesting.

For instance, a job advertisement from a renowned company would receive hundreds of thousands of applications. A recent graduate interested in the role may apply with a great resume, cover letter, and portfolio of work. However, if a thousand people get those right, they are still knee-deep in competition. So, apart from a good dossier, an added advantage is needed that can come in many forms.

Perhaps, an entry-level web developer primarily needs programming skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Laravel, Python, and MySQL. These are skills that nearly every apt web developer has. But, experimentation experience in developing Smart Contracts and knowing the Solidity language accounts for that edge, making them graduate to the top one to five percent of the applicants. These future skills can be easily accessed online for free or at convenient prices.

Advantages can also take much simpler forms, like being a graduate from a perceivably top-tier institution in Bangladesh or studying abroad. Not to disregard university-level education in Bangladesh, but many employers in our country are attracted to foreign degrees.

Foreign degrees can also open doors to the global workplace. Having studied at the University of Sydney for my master's, I know that experience, networks, and affiliation can open many opportunities. Currently, foreign degrees are plentiful online as well. However, there is a stark difference between studying online and having the experience of a full-blown campus and academic environment.

Campus life incubates peer-to-peer learning. It expands on extracurricular experiences as well and activates a student's social circle, enabling them to mix with others from diverse backgrounds and different skill levels. This is amplified further if the campus is a global education institution.

However, it is difficult to get into foreign institutions because of competition and financial bottlenecks. Satellite or branch campuses of global universities are a great countermeasure to bring these international education institutions closer to international students as opposed to them going abroad. NYU Shanghai, Monash Malaysia, and Carnegie Mellon in Qatar are just a few examples of globally stationed branch campuses.

Thankfully, one such institution opened up in Bangladesh as well – Universal College Bangladesh, a place which gives out Monash University's foundation year courses and is accredited by the University Grants Commission, enabling easy access to Monash Malaysia or Monash Australia which is ranked 57th in the world by QS as of 2022.

It is inspiring to see growth in prospective Bangladeshi students' access to these institutions as the international curriculum guarantees the adoption of future skills and the networks to make it big in one's career and life.

Options such as complete digital education, skill-based short courses, onsite education, hybrid deliveries and easy pathways to enrol in top-tier institutions are now available. Bangladeshi students and graduates are making considerable headway both locally and globally. The quality of students in Bangladesh has always been great. We just did not have the connectivity and opportunities to go global at scale.

Now, we do.

411,Making the most out of self-help books,"Self-help books are some of the most popular reads to exist. Almost everybody has had experiences where somebody comes over to them, buzzing with excitement, and ask in the most fervorous manner possible, ""Have you read that book? You really should, this book changed my outlook on life!""

Despite all the uproar regarding self-help books, most that I have read never seem to be, well, helpful. The first chapter is usually about some deep, pretentious hogwash about how abiding by just a few simple rules has the ability to change somebody's lifestyle and perspective entirely. The books then continue to list the most ludicrous standards known to mankind, for example, eating vegetables grown in your own garden while you live in a bustling city. To entertain the notion that these books could have the power to be life-changing is like saying that Hero Alom has the potential to win an Oscar.

However, there are ways you can make the most out of your experience with a self-help book:

Set achievable dietary restrictions

Although there is no need to follow the strict, ridiculous regimens suggested, try to set a few boundaries. These boundaries should be something you feel comfortable with and do not have a difficult time adjusting to. For example, instead of refraining from eating red meat at all, you could limit it to once or twice every fortnight.

Aim for practical and affordable

Buying organic fruits and vegetables to stay healthy, or paying a premium for an app to organise your day down to the minute may look good on paper, but is a whole different case when you're being realistic. Especially for students with tight budgets, expensive items that make life easier aren't the most facile to come by. Go for things that do not put stress on your wallet, but at the same time you can make the most out of.

Make an efficient routine

Allocate different pockets of time in your day to fit in some meditation or exercise tips from the book. All the time slots do not have to be filled with productive activities either; leave out time for your luxury and relaxation. There is no need to stress yourself out if the routine goes awry either, try to continue with your day as best as you can. Your life is not something you can map out, things are bound to spin out of control from time to time.

412,How to deal with disagreements with your teacher,"Authority does not necessitate agreement. Although teachers are there to advise and guide you, it is inevitable that you get into disagreements with them. Such is human nature, and it is not something that should be discouraged or shamed. However, in the complex arena that a classroom can often be, it is best to tread wisely when it comes to tackling disagreements with teachers, lest you fall on their bad side and have your assessment compromised.

Firstly, disagreements pop up mostly in subjects that are more related to the arts or social sciences, and less so in STEM fields, although the latter is not impossible either. The subjective nature of the former ones make it so that various opinions and perspectives are brought to the table. Often, there is no clear-cut right answer, and much can be debated over among students and with teachers, which can often be healthy, insightful and productive.

If such situations are allowed, it indicates that the teacher has respect for their students and values their input, despite them being less qualified or potentially less knowledgeable than them on the matter. This can be highly motivating for the students, who will be encouraged to freely discuss their thoughts and views without the fear of punishment or ridicule, leading to effective learning.

However, not all teachers are so open to disagreement. Some do not want to give students the opportunity to express themselves, possibly because they feel it's unnecessary or they don't find students' inputs to be valuable. Others may feel that it is disrespectful when a pupil disagrees with their instructor, and they should instead blindly go along with everything that they teach in the classroom. This can be very demoralising for the students, who may feel suppressed by the authority figure.

In cases like these, it is best to be more strategic when voicing your opinions as a student. Plainly blurting out your views that oppose the instructor's can be a bad idea. Instead, you can try posing your opinion as a question. Maybe even include research, statistics and evidence to back up your claim. For example, instead of saying ""XYZ is bad"", it would be more tactful to say ""What are your thoughts on new evidence being found that XYZ is injurious to our health?"" This way, the teacher doesn't feel threatened, and therefore they're more likely to be receptive towards what you have to say.

Furthermore, it's also important to analyse what the reaction from your classmates may be. If you feel that the reaction will be overwhelmingly negative and you won't be able to handle that, you can opt to meet the teacher after class during their office hours, which will relieve much of the pressure coming from being in a classroom.

Despite all this, there are times where it's best to just let it go. Picking your battles wisely is an important lesson to learn, especially when your grades and assessments are at stake. Therefore, first decide whether the risks are manageable enough for you to voice your disagreements safely, and then proceed. If they're not, then prioritising your academic performance might be the right choice. But if the risks are manageable, don't hesitate to stand up for what you believe in, keeping in mind that tact and respectfulness are paramount in making sure you get your point across while neither compromising your grades nor your values.

413,Studying journalism in this day and age,"Watching movies like Spotlight and All the President's Men, I used to look in the mirror and think, ""I can be another Michael Rezendes or Carl Bernstein if I had the nose for news."" The admissions process rolled around, and I was not exactly thrilled to learn that I would be able to major in Political Science. My heart yearned for journalism, so I migrated departments.

I had many things to bemoan, but not migrating to journalism. The teachers were enthusiastic about their subjects, and the curriculum was just what I was looking for. I am currently in my third year and have missed a total of only four classes, primarily because I love what I study. I learned about so many things alongside the fundamentals of journalism. I learned about the nuances Mrinal Sen left in his films, and I learned about how Nazi party employed propaganda to manipulate the Germans. I learned about what a staccato lead is and how Chanakya's Arthashastra was a practical guide to governing a nation. Studying journalism has marked an epoch in my life.

Right after starting classes, the pandemic gripped the world. My spirit did not diminish even during the online classes. With nothing to do but stay chronically online, I read online discourses about Mushtaq Ahmed and Ahmed Kishore being detained under the Digital Security Act. Then, in 2021, Rozina Islam faced charges under Articles 379 and 411 of the Penal Code as well as Articles 3 and 5 of the Official Secrets Act 1923 for her anti-corruption reporting. I gradually realised that pursuing a career that this major will lead to had its risks, and my dream of being another Rezendes or Bernstein might even put me behind bars. The recent case of Shamsuzzaman Shams does not ease my worries.

As I weigh the risks and uncertainties involved in this field against other seemingly ""safe"" career options, the constant questions about my chosen journalism major haunt me every day. Every sentence I may write carries the burden of possible misinterpretation, I can only hope that what I write aligns with the law when it should align with the truth. So, I learn to censor myself.

The urge to leave the country for higher education and never return can be strong, fuelled by the unpredictable future of journalism in Bangladesh. Nevertheless, an inner voice fully comprehends the dire consequences of the words I speak and write and urges me to stay in my country and make a difference, whatever obstacles stand in my way.

415,What it takes to get into DU C Unit,"Everyone discusses what it takes to get into a certain university but no one talks about what this admission season takes away from our lives. Looking back, it surprises me how carefree I was in my admission days. I was never a textbook ""good student"" because of my laziness like Nobita's but my results somehow resembled Dekisugi's.

Admission season was different. It wasn't anything like our usual academic exams, and it was definitely frustrating as well. When I made up my mind to prepare for Institute of Business Administration (IBA) Dhaka University (DU), I could feel how unfit I was for that fast-paced analytical exam. Just 12 days before my C unit admission test, I decided not to go for IBA and to devote my time solely to my HSC books.

But just like Nobita, I still wasted the first six days crying about my poor choices. I spent the next six days studying the same things I've learnt in the past four years as a business student in high school and college. This must have worked because some weeks later, I noticed I had ranked 8th in Dhaka University's C unit admission test. I know this story sounds too good to be true, but in reality, it's merely the result of years spent attempting to comprehend how things function rather than memorising facts.

The 30-mark written part of the C unit admission test question was a blessing in disguise for me. Since the written portion of the DU's admission tests was still relatively new, there were no specific guidelines for the materials that admission coaching centres could offer. Since I didn't have the time to follow any suggestions, I applied my creative writing skills there.

Examinees in 2023 will find this section to be more difficult because it carries 40 marks out of the exam's total of 120. This 45-minute segment will include translations and error corrections in both Bangla and English. There will be questions on Accounting, Business Organisation and Management, Finance, Banking and Insurance, and Marketing.

I've always done well in school since I loved my Business Studies subjects. Despite being the topper in both school and college test exams, I failed to achieve a golden A+ in my SSC or HSC exams. It might not seem significant right now but at the time, it was aggravating to see myself struggling in the board exams.

To add to the troubles, 20 marks of the 120-mark admission test were based on SSC/O level & HSC/A level scores. Getting into DU seemed far-fetched back then.

However, anyone who enjoyed studying the Business Studies topics in their HSC should pass this exam with ease, because I didn't notice any questions on my test that were noticeably out of the syllabus.

It says on the admission notice that ""the purpose of the examination will be to verify the knowledge acquired at the higher secondary level. Question papers will be prepared based on the syllabus at higher secondary level.""

All examinees should take these words on the admission notice seriously. I've observed numerous instructors at various coaching centres disregard this instruction and convince examinees that passing this exam requires rocket science. My results prove these thoughts to be a myth.

Not everyone can do well in this exam the same way I did, however, so here's some general advice for everyone. You should have a profound knowledge of your business-related subjects and a proper grasp of Bangla and English grammar and vocabulary. You should solve previous years' questions, and practice translations or error corrections daily.

Although the written portion is now slightly different, analysing previous questions is always an effective way of understanding the question pattern and important topics. Practice will pay off, whether you work alone or with the help of an admission coaching centre. Your HSC books, any C unit guides with questions and any wordbooks should be enough to practise by yourself. Model tests can also be helpful.

Conceptual questions from compulsory subjects like Bangla, English, Accounting, and Business Organisation and Management are included in the 60-mark, 45-minute Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) section. You can choose between Finance, Banking and Insurance or Marketing. It doesn't matter if you answer questions from the Marketing section without having it as an HSC subject. It also doesn't matter if you want to study in the Department of Finance but you answer marketing-related questions, and vice versa.

Your written answer script won't be examined unless you receive 5 out of 12 in English and 24 out of 60 in the MCQ section. Remember to be mindful of the negative marking, which is 0.25 for each incorrect response. Learn to skip confusing questions.

The question pattern and mark distribution for English medium students are a bit different but the preparation plans and exam strategies for the C unit exam should be identical.

Most of you already know that there are nine departments in the Faculty of Business Studies, DU. Out of them, 30-32 courses are common to all departments and 8-10 courses are offered for respective majors. After the results, if you want to specialise in a certain subject, choose it. But if you're confused, I'd suggest taking a look at the BBA brochures of each department available online and then deciding.

To answer the original question of what it takes to get into DU C unit, the answer is that it takes passion, motivation, practice, knowledge, calmness, luck and most importantly a certain sense of achieving a goal. Stay true to yourself, always be aware of what you want and where you want to see yourself, and make a plan and work for it accordingly. It may seem unachievable, but it really isn't.

Last but not least, please believe that failure is not the end of life. If not DU C unit, life will provide you with something even better.

416,How to get into Bangla folk music,"Bangla folk music is a rich and diverse genre that has evolved over centuries in the eastern part of the subcontinent comprising the Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura, and Bangladesh. From the soulful Baul music of the wandering minstrels to the lively beats of the Bhatiali boat songs, Bangla folk music is a treasure trove of culture and history. While a handful of folk songs have been popularised by contemporary artists and production houses, and continue to appeal to the masses, a massive portion of this magnificent genre remains in the dark.

Dabbling in a new music genre can feel daunting but you can follow a few steps to further explore Bangla folk music.

Start with the popular stuff and attend concerts

Needless to say, the first step to getting into Bangla folk music is to start listening to it. You can find a wide variety of Bangla folk music on online platforms as well as through traditional media like television and radio. It helps to start with the most popular songs.

Bangla folk music continues to be celebrated across the musical communities in Bangladesh and India. In fact, many artists have created beautiful contemporary renditions of various folk songs. Coke Studio Bangla, Gaan Bangla TV, and Folk Studio Bangla are some of the more popular YouTube channels you can start exploring the genre with. You can also check for upcoming folk music events and concerts in your area, and experience the energy and excitement of a live performance.

Know the sub-genres

Bangla folk music is incredibly diverse and can be classified into a multitude of sub-genres. Baul, Bhawaiya, and Bhatiali are some of the more popular sub-genres.

Each of these categories has its distinct style, rhythm, and theme. For example, Baul music expresses the spiritual journey of the Bauls and the mystic minstrels of rural Bengal. Accompanied by austere instruments, their music is characterised by simplicity, spontaneity, and soulfulness.

Bhawaiya songs originated in the northern region of Bengal and explore themes of love, romance, and the day-to-day struggles of rural Bengalis. Bhatiali, on the other hand, originated in the coastal areas. The songs, dealing with themes such as rivers, love, and nature, are an assortment of melodious tunes usually sung by boatmen as they rowed their boats. Apart from these categories, Bengali folk music includes many other forms, each with compelling themes and diverse structures.

Learn to play a folk musical instrument

If you're interested in playing music yourself, picking up a Bangla folk instrument is be a great way to connect with the tradition. Some widely played folk instruments in Bangladesh and West Bengal are Ektara, Dotara, Flute, and Dhol. You can take lessons from a local music teacher and even learn through online tutorials and videos.

Learn about the history and culture of Bangla folk music

Finally, to truly appreciate and understand Bangla folk music, it's essential to learn about the history and culture behind the music. Folk music has long been used to ridicule oppressive social structures and also been a tool to point out the obvious problems in society through the ages. Read books and articles about the history of this genre and its impact on the history of the Bengal region. That way, the themes will not feel alien even if you have had minimal exposure to Bangla folk.

The world of Bangla folk music is a vibrant and colourful tapestry of melodies, rhythms, and lyrics that tell stories of love, loss, struggle, joy and the divine. It remains a testament to the creativity and resilience of people from this part of the world.

417,Working out a productive study schedule for Ramadan,"For students, Ramadan can be a challenging time to keep up with academic responsibilities while also observing the holy month's religious obligations. With long hours of fasting and late-night prayers, it is understandable if studying takes a backseat.

But worry not, for you can do a few things to make the most of this holy month and attain both spiritual and academic excellence.

Experiment with what works for you

Adjust your usual study timetable a bit. When we fast, it is typical to get groggy and lose our attention span while studying. So, the wise thing to do is to study when we are most energised.

You can study at night up to sehri time and sleep during the day. However, some prefer to study after fajr, and some prefer sticking to a usual schedule consistent with daylight hours. There is no right way or wrong way of doing it. Every person has their own preference, so it is your job to figure out which timetable works best for you.

Plan ahead

Without a well-thought-out study plan, it is easy to become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material to be covered, especially during Ramadan. By taking the time to plan ahead, you can ensure that you cover all necessary material and get them done within time by reducing the likelihood of procrastination or last-minute cramming.

Break down studying into manageable chunks

Dividing your task into manageable chunks and taking frequent breaks can help you avoid burnout and keep going. The Pomodoro technique is a very popular approach used by students, but it is better to adjust it to what suits you the best. Chunking is not limited to studying and can also be used for your prayers and Quran recitation.

Take breaks

Studying for long periods of hours can be draining especially during Ramadan. You will have times when you will be struggling to concentrate, so consider taking a break because your brain needs one. It can range from taking a shower to napping or going for a walk. Remember that it is completely fine to get some rest. Just make sure you use your energy efficiently when it returns.

Get yourself a study buddy

Getting a friend on board to study with you will not only make studying less stressful, but it will also improve focus and retention for both of you. If you don't have any friends (like me), worry not. ""Study With Me"" YouTube videos or live streams can be just as helpful as having a study buddy.

Have nutritious food for sehri and iftar

After a long day of fasting, it can be tempting to eat fried or fast foods. However, remember that what you eat will affect your productivity, making you feel lethargic and less energetic faster. So, try incorporating more brain foods and more slow-energy foods into your diet.

Ramadan is more about recharging our souls and coming together to celebrate what we believe in than the academic challenges we face. Thus, we are not expected to overlook the spiritual significance of this holy month in our attempts to be productive.

418,What it takes to get into DU B unit,"My Dhaka University (DU) journey started on my first day at college when I learned about the qualifications of many of my teachers at Govt. Michael Madhusudan College, Jashore. Most of them had graduated from DU, and they told us all about the excellence of the country's premier university, which inspired me a lot to start taking preparation for the admission test for B unit.

During my preparation period for the admission test, I got the opportunity to communicate with seniors who got admitted to DU in previous years. This helped me design my study plan for the admission tests.

Students from the Arts background are eligible for participating in DU's B unit admission test. Success in this admission test grants them the opportunity to admit themselves into subjects like Law, English, International Relations, Economics and so on. The B unit admission test comprises three topics – Bangla, English, and General knowledge. The Bangla and English section are derived from the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) English and Bangla books. The General Knowledge section is derived from recent event, as well as other subjects that are part of the HSC syllabus for the Arts section, and some questions may appear from ICT as well. The questions focus on testing the students on their basic knowledge of Bangla and English. General Knowledge, on the other hand, is all about finding out whether students keep up with current affairs and testing their powers of memorisation. Therefore, to obtain good marks in the General Knowledge section, students must dedicate their time to continue going over the same topics over and over again, as this section plays a salient role in ensuring qualification to study certain subjects if a student does pass the exam.

Time management

Students get 60 minutes to answer around 60 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) followed by 30 minutes of descriptive writing. This leaves them with one minute for each question.

It is important to know the order in which a student wants to approach each section of the question paper. If a student wants to get into the Department of English, they have to achieve a certain amount of marks in the English section of the question, so they should focus on that portion more.

Like with any exam, one should start with the subject they feel most comfortable with and then get into the more difficult ones, and stay calm if they face any difficulties. During my exam, I allocated three separate time slots for the three sections. It's important to make sure that a student passes all the sections separately because only then will their descriptive writing section be examined.

Be aware of negative marking

For every wrong answer, 0.25 marks are deducted from the total. Thus, it's a wise decision to avoid answering a question unless one is sure about it. But if anyone is a good guesser, or has good instincts, they can try making some educated guesses because sometimes we suffer from the regret of not answering a question that we thought would be correct if we went with our gut feeling. As I am personally not good at it, I tried to avoid this.

Practice helps with this by increasing speed and accuracy. I used to solve questions from previous years over and over again and evaluate myself every day. It also helped me recognise my mistakes and allowed me to learn how to minimise errors. Besides, it gave me self-confidence and a sense of time management. I practised the written part with special care because a large section of students drop out of the race because they don't get the required number in the written part despite getting good marks in the MCQ section.

The mental aspect

Many students get disoriented at a point during their preparation when they experience the vastness of the admission test syllabus. This is a problem only if a student finds it difficult to be regular. I tried to finish the day's work on the day which gave me the confidence to gain ground over time and cover the whole syllabus.

If at any time it feels like the mental pressure is getting too much, that information should be shared with parents, teachers, or someone trustworthy with the ability to help. Mental strength may just be the supreme tool to conquer the exam field of admission.

Staying true

Other than these obvious tricks of the trade, one important thing to remember would be to ignore the negativity that is prevalent among admission seekers during this time. Staying positive and executing the plans one sets down on the path to success is vital. Instead of working too hard and getting nowhere, it's important to devise smart plans that work for the individual.

Once that is done, all that is left is to give our best during the exam and hope that luck favours us.

419,Preparing for O levels without attending coaching classes,"If you've been a student in the last ten years or so, chances are you've probably invested a significant amount of time chasing ruthless coaching schedules. Coaching culture is nothing new in Bangladesh, but the cult-like reverence it has gained certainly is. In the eyes of many parents and students, preparing for your board exams without after-school help is the same as not preparing at all.

Despite this, I've had the rare opportunity to prepare for my O levels without attending coaching classes at all.

Whilst the mere idea of having to study without after-school help might seem daunting to some, my experience has been painless and straightforward. Granted, I've had to put a reasonable amount of attention into my school classes, but apart from that, the internet and books are all I've needed to keep up my grades. For O and A levels, online resources are widespread and publicly available for everyone to access, and arguably a better experience than external coaching, partly because you can pace yourself accordingly instead of following a pedagogy crafted for a more diverse demographic.

A major advantage of not attending coaching classes is the amount of liberty it has offered me. Instead of spending hours stuck in traffic and rushing everywhere to attend coaching classes, I've been able to find time to indulge in activities that interest me and develop my extracurriculars. The liberty of studying on my own has skyrocketed my productivity and made studying less stressful than it is for my peers.

Of course, not attending coaching classes has its drawbacks too. For many, the initial stages of self-studying are akin to the effects of withdrawal one gets by quitting an addiction. Untethering yourself from the coaching culture seems unfathomably difficult in the early days, as you struggle to settle in and find a track in your curriculum. Thankfully, this subsides quickly as you get adjusted to your new lifestyle and discover what suits you best.

One problem that persists in my experience is distraction. A rough day, a stressful exam, or even just a foul mood can sometimes result in my pace dwindling and cause lethargy to overwhelm my motivation, which can become particularly detrimental considering the limited time students get to prepare for their exams.

Another side-effect of not going to coaching classes is the loneliness it often harbours within people. These classes are not just for studying. They're also hubs for socialising. Many of my peers credit their coaching for the people they share bonds with today. Not going to coaching classes often mean missing out on such things.

Study leaves at school become boring and frustrating, and social media simply serves as proof of your isolation, bringing out the worst of your mental health and making you feel miserable. Fortunately, all of this only lasts for an incredibly short time, and spending free time with your friends instantly recharges your battery.

Not going to coaching classes isn't for everyone, but if it works for you, having the freedom and liberty of not relying on external help may well be the greatest privilege you'll have in your academic career.

420,What it takes to get into DU A unit,"Seeing my older brother go through the university admission journey almost five years before me gave me a sneak peek into the rigorousness of the process. As someone who belongs to a batch of students who had lost about a year to Covid-19, stepping into the realm of admission tests was an overwhelming experience, maybe more so than for anyone else.

Dhaka University's A unit admission test is the path that leads to studying engineering, pure science, life science and other science- related subjects. The test has two major sections: 60 multiple-choice questions in 45 minutes and another 45 minutes for the written part. In the test, students must answer questions on the main subjects they had in their HSC, and then they get to choose between English, Bangla, and their fourth subject. Since I was determined to pursue something related to Biology in my undergrad, I went for Biology. For students who don't want to study Biology related subjects, and have a good command of English, choosing to answer the English section is a good idea. This way, the chance to study engineering and other science subjects remains open.

As I advanced with my preparation, the trickiest part of the test for me was to solve the mathematical problems without a calculator. As I was taking preparation the engineering admission test alongside DU A unit prep, knowing how to use the calculator efficiently was a crucial skill to adapt. What helped me to get better at doing complex calculations without a calculator was sitting for practice tests every day for a month or so before the actual exam. Getting used to doing calculations in my head or relying on the elimination method for answering multiple choice questions helped me to be more efficient at solving problems.

For both Chemistry and Physics, it is important to have a clear understanding of basic concepts and accuracy in descriptive writing since the written part has recently been added to the test. Chemistry in the multiple-choice section mostly tests a student's theoretical knowledge, so reading the textbook contents intensively can help them ace it. As I did not have to sit for Biology in my HSC, I had to put extra effort into maintaining a regular revision routine to carry out preparation in Biology alongside the other subjects. Making flashcards of the content that I was struggling to remember and going through them regularly helped me a lot.

Analysing previous years' questions

This applies to almost every admission test you're going to sit for. Analysing the questions from the previous ten years or so gives a rough idea about the actual test. Since the written section is a comparatively newer addition to the test, it's safer to develop equal expertise on both the theoretical and mathematical problems.

Stress management

The enormous pressure a candidate feels during this season is very expected. I had friends who were stellar performers in the mocks but panicked at the last moment and could not give their best in the real test. Knowing how to manage stress in the exam hall plays a vital role while you're trying to give your possible best. To handle the overwhelming feelings, it is a must to attend as many mocks as possible and to give them equal importance as to that of the actual test. Simulating the exam hall environment at the test center or even at home when giving mocks will help to identify exactly what part of the exam a student is losing concentration or getting perplexed.

Time management

Admission tests generally have a tendency to go in unpredictable directions. So, it comes in handy if students have a preferable sequence of subjects to approach each section. Starting with the subject one is most confident with will give them an early boost in the examination hall. Some subjects require more time to answer than others. Mapping that out in the head beforehand and having a backup plan will reduce some stress.

Knowing how to skip

This is the skill I undermined the most at the beginning of my admission journey. The test is about how accurately students can answer the questions in a very limited time. It is important to accept that one might have to skip a question midway to prevent wasting too much time on one single problem. This will also help in not getting overwhelmed if a question is too difficult to solve on the first try.

Tracking error

The main objective of mock tests is to help students identify their weaknesses and strengths. Keeping track of all the errors made in the practice tests and analysing them is definitely a game changer to utilising the mocks to their best.

Although the rationality of judging one's capability by a ninety-minute-long examination remains questionable, a good deal of luck with hard work is what can get you through this. The end result of success in the DU A unit exam is the opportunity to study some exciting topics with some of the top minds in the country, so putting in the hard work may well be worth it.

421,Cambridge Majlis celebrates South Asians and Anti-Colonial history,"The Cambridge Majlis is a student society at Cambridge founded in 1891 as a platform for discussion of social and political issues in South Asia. The Majlis moulded some of South Asia's most influential political figures and leaders like India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen. Figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, E.M. Forster, and Bertrand Russell also addressed the Majlis.

Over the past few years, Majlis members have uncovered much of the society's long-neglected history. An archival exhibition at the Wren Library in Trinity College showcases many of the region's leaders and thinkers. It highlights how Majlis members played an active role in the Indian independence struggle in the 1930s and 40s. Archives from the British Library show that the Majlis' 'seditious activities' and 'communist leanings' led the Metropolitan Police and Scotland Yard to begin monitoring its activities.

The Majlis debated and discussed issues such as the Government of India Act and Britain's policy of divide and rule and also engaged in political action to further the independence movement. Protests were held, petitions were signed, and money was raised to ""Get the British out of India"". In response to a proclamation by Gandhi that Indian students should hold monthly demonstrations and meetings to demand the release of political prisoners, the Majlis held a gathering at St. John's College, Cambridge on February 10, 1945. The Cambridge Majlis received wires from both Gandhi and Nehru, thanking them for their contribution to the Indian Independence movement.

One of those under scrutiny in this period, Subrata Ray Chowdhury, went on to become a leading constitutional lawyer in India. Scotland Yard's recently declassified records include his correspondence with Irish nationalist leaders expressing support for freedom fighters against the British Raj. Chowdhury also reportedly travelled to Ireland where he was expected to meet Seán O'Kelly, the new President of Ireland and De Valera, who had a leading role in introducing the 1937 Constitution of Ireland.

Chowdhury also met with both Seán and Irish republican, revolutionary and suffragette Maud Gonne MacBride on this visit. MacBride was also a long-time love interest of the poet W.B. Yeats. Her son Seán MacBride, the Irish independence activist and later politician, founded Amnesty International. Interestingly, reinforcing the ties to South Asia, Seán MacBride later formed part of the 'people's commission of enquiry' created in September 1980 to investigate the circumstances impeding the prosecution of those responsible for the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family members.

In the 1950s, as ideas of state-building, economic policy and modes of government dominated discourse, the Majlis provided a way for South Asian students to directly engage with public and political life in the post-colonial, post-partitioned world. Majlis members during this period went on to become influential policymakers in their respective countries.

The Majlis stopped its activities after 1971, reportedly following the rising tensions between Indians and Pakistanis at Cambridge over Bangladesh's war of Independence. After almost five decades, following Mahid Qamar and Sahil Baid's rediscovery of the Archives, the Majlis returned to being a centre of South Asian intellectual and cultural life at Cambridge.

Since its revival, it has had presidents from India (Sara Saloo, 2021), Pakistan (Mahid 2019 and Sahil 2020) and now, Bangladesh (Laleh Bergman Hossain 2022).",2023-03-28 00:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/shout/news/cambridge-majlis-celebrates-south-asians-and-anti-colonial-history-3282156,2023-05-18 10:27:25,thedailystar
422,A definitive guide to the digital SAT,"The SAT, or the Scholastic Assessment Test, is a standardised test conducted by the College Board that is needed for undergraduate university admissions in the United States. Until very recently, the SATs were taken by paper. However, a few years back, the College Board announced its intentions of fully digitalising the SATs and the very first digital SAT was administered internationally on March 11, 2023.

If you are thinking of applying to universities in the US and are confused about the new SATs, here are a few guiding points for you.

The key differences between the digital and paper SAT

While the previous SATs required students to physically solve the paper and write in the answers on an answer sheet, the digital SATs are conducted through an app named Bluebook where you can digitally access the paper and input your answers.

The paper SAT consisted of an English section and a Math section, with them being divided into two sub-sections each – Reading and Writing, and Calculator and Non-calculator. The digital SATs also consist of two sections but they are divided into two modules each and the two modules have no difference between them in regard to the pattern of questions. Both the English modules have 27 questions each and both are 32 minutes long. The Math modules have 22 questions each, and are both timed at 35 minutes.

A major reason behind students struggling with the previous SAT was its length of over three hours. The digital SAT is comparatively shorter at 2 hours and 14 minutes, and there is a 10-minute break between the Math and English sections.

The digital SAT also claims to be adaptive, which means how well you do on the first module for each section determines the difficulty level of your questions on the second module.

The style of questions is a little different now. Instead of focusing on Reading and Writing skills separately, the digital SAT tests your evidence-based reading and language skills simultaneously. The English section, which previously had long passages with multiple questions from each passage, has been altered so that it contains smaller passages and only one question per passage. This makes it easier for people who struggle to keep their attention perfectly attuned to stay focused and means that you will likely find the answer to your evidence-based question with less searching.

The Math section doesn't have many differences in terms of question pattern. The big change is the fact that students can use calculator in both the modules as opposed to before when its use was restricted to one module. The app, Bluebook, in fact has a built-in graphing calculator that students can use in addition to their own approved calculator. The percentage of student-generated responses as compared to multiple choice answers is also higher now in the Math section.

The key skills required to excel at the SATs remain roughly the same as before.

How exactly do you sit for the SATs?

In order to register for the SATs, you have to head over to the College Board website, create an account, select a session and then proceed to fill in a form and pay a fee (USD 100 for the March session). A few different test centres are available and you get to choose a location which is convenient for you.

During registration, they provide you with the necessary information about your testing device. You have to bring your own testing device – a laptop or a tablet – to the physical testing centre. If you don't have a device of your own, you can request a device from College Board and the testing centre will arrange one for you. My testing centre had charging portals available, but it is advisable that you take a fully charged device with a battery life of at least three hours. You will be provided with scratch paper by the invigilator.

How can you prepare for the digital SATs?

The best way to prepare for a test that is as dependent on your time management skills as the SAT is to practise. Khan Academy, in collaboration with College Board, has an official digital SAT prep course that is free of cost. Four full length mock tests are available on the Bluebook app. Once you take them, the app marks them digitally and provides you with a score from 400-1600. Doing these will give you a better idea of the question pattern as well as the areas where you may need to put in more effort.

423,Navigating the world with a poker face,"Right when we were about to go on stage to get our science fair awards, my friend subtly elbowed me in the ribs and hissed, ""You really need to start smiling more.""

This was back in eighth grade, and even to this day, there are times when I struggle with looking like I'm over it. Sure, like Simone Biles said, ""Smiling doesn't win you gold medals"" but a soft, approachable expression can do wonders in the way people perceive us, or at least that's what I've been told over the years. Many people who're now some of my best friends have told how they thought I was an ice queen when they first saw me, and it's definitely the worst in group settings because then I have to be extra diligent in building a rapport with others. Without the compensation of smiles and calculated expressions, I know I appear cold and uninterested, and perhaps even unwell, because there have been times when people directly asked if I was going through hard times when in reality, I was actually really happy about something.

But surprisingly, it's not all bad. For starters, having a poker face myself means I'm less intimidated by others with a stony expression because I know that usually, it's nothing personal. They're probably not even aware that they have their poker face on, and won't mind being approached. As a result, I'm more comfortable in my social interactions and open to engaging with more people. On the flip side, of course, my face can act as a great repellent for unnecessary chats when I'm not in the mood for them. I also have an easier time in negotiations because I don't come off as desperate, and when I'm working in a team, I always earn my teammates' trust as the most level-headed one.

That being said, my poker face has ironically made me more invested in those around me. Because I know some people often wrongly translate a poker face as annoyance or flippancy, I pay more attention to my facial expressions and body language when I'm talking, and that helps me make people feel safer. Similarly, my focus on my own social and emotional cues in conversations means I observe other's behavior very minutely as well. Be it very well-hidden contempt or more apparent hints, chances are I'll notice instantly.

Poker faces get a lot of negative attention in social settings, and I can obviously see why. Even if unintended, it can come across as apathetic or even angry to most people, and unless someone's alright with how people perceive them, it'll be in their best interest to figure out when they really should put on that face. After all, it can be both an asset and a liability, and it all depends on the timing and place. In my personal experience, my poker face has been a source of understanding how I interact with other people as well as how other people interact with me, and for that, I'm grateful.

424,A guide to applying for undergraduate programs in the United States,"Applying to universities in the United States is a confusing, exhausting, and painful experience. So, here is a five-step guide cultivated from my experiences and mistakes on how to make it less so.

Plan your standardised tests

A good SAT score makes a lot of difference. Start preparing early and sit for your first test at least six months before your application deadline so that you can re-sit for it if needed. You will also need to sit for the IELTS Academic test. While not all US universities require proof of English proficiency, some do, and you will definitely need it to apply for your student visa anyway. Any score above 7 should do.

Do a lot of research

The key to getting into US universities all boils down to finding the right fit. Find a list of 10 to 20 universities that interest you and spend as much time as you can to find features about the institutions that align with your personality and life goals.

University websites and YouTube videos by currently enrolled students are excellent places to start. At the same time, think about how your specific quirks and traits will fit within their community. This is an effective way to tie your application back to your hobbies and extracurriculars.

Also, take note of all your deadlines including financial aid applications. This entire process needs to be thorough and should take about three months.

Get your academic documents in order

Your high-school counsellor is your best friend here. Universities require a high-school transcript from your counsellor with a record of your school and board exam grades.

If you apply before graduation, you will receive predicted grades. In most cases, you will also need a minimum of two recommendation letters from school teachers. However, don't stress if the recommendation letters and transcripts are slightly overdue. Most universities generally grant a couple of weeks after the deadline for your counsellor and teachers to submit their materials.

Apply for financial aid

Most colleges will either provide financial aid or scholarships. For financial aid, check whether the university you are applying to is either need-blind or need-aware. The latter will consider financial aid requirements as part of your evaluation.

Your financial aid application starts with a College Scholarship Service (CSS) profile which documents all your household income, costs, and the estimated amount your family can contribute. Here, you will need your parents' tax returns and bank statements.

Note, Bangladeshi applicants need the tax return from the previous tax year. For instance, applicants for fall 2023 will submit the tax return from the 2020 to 2021 tax year. Afterwards, some universities might request verification of documents through an Institutional Documentation Service (IDOC) package or their own portal.

Write a stellar essay

There isn't any fixed formula for writing a stellar essay. This is actually a blessing in disguise as it allows you to express your true self. For inspiration, you can check out various online resources to find excellent sample essays from successful applications.

However, avoid plagiarism at all costs. Universities will detect it no matter how obscure your sources are. And obviously, don't make others write it for you. Besides being unethical, it will only lead to impersonal essays that colleges don't appreciate.

425,BMSS organises ABC of Surgery workshop,"On March 10, the Standing Committee on Medical Education (SCOME) of Bangladesh Medical Students' Society (BMSS) organised the event ""ABC of Surgery"" at Ibrahim Cardiac Hospital and Research Institute with third and fifth-year medical students as well as intern doctors from various medical colleges across Bangladesh. The surgical workshop was conducted under the supervision of Dr Saklayen Russel, Associate Professor and Head of the Department of Vascular Surgery, Ibrahim Cardiac Hospital and Research Institute, in collaboration with Nutricare as the nutrition partner.

The event was inaugurated with a presentation from the National Officer of SCOME, Dr Suzana Afrin, regarding the past activities of SCOME. It was then followed by a welcome speech from Dr Saklayen.

There were several interesting sessions about surgical training skills facilitated by doctors of the Vascular Surgery department. Assistant Registrars Dr Wahidul Azad Palash and Dr Rusama Nuzhat discussed surgical dressing, suture materials, and knots. Following that, two other sessions were taken by resident doctors, Dr Saima Islam and Dr Marjan Hashi, regarding IV cannulations, catheterisation, and surgical history taking.

Later, Dr Serajus Salekin, Assistant Professor of Thoracic Surgery at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, taught the students and intern doctors about pleural fluid aspiration.

The most awaited segment was conducted by the abovementioned trainers – the hands-on training segment. The participants were divided into three groups, and each group took turns on three different stations. They explored the operation theatre, learnt how to do dressing on an admitted patient, and had the opportunity to use surgical instruments for practising suturing techniques. Dr Saklayen demonstrated the proper method of gowning and wearing gloves and ended the event with an interactive Q&A session with the audience.

At the end of the day, Dr Saklayen and the other doctors of the Vascular Surgery Department received crests from the President of BMSS, Dr Myesha Maliha Binte Mamun. All the participants were provided with certificates as well.

428,How I learned to not hate dorms,"I remember when my roommate started to cough frantically at 2:30 AM one day, making me wake up. He had a severe cold for a few days, and that night it got worse. I got up from my bed to fetch the medicine and got the syrup for him. It didn't feel like a big deal at the time, but the realisation hit me later, what had I just done?

Had I encountered this situation just a while back, I'd have probably panicked and woken up an elderly at that ungodly hour from their deep slumber and explained them the situation in half-baked sentences and watched what they do.

For my whole life, I have been in Dhaka. My life was in Dhaka, with my family and friends. My school and my college always had the same roads and I was always at home after dark (aside from a few thrilling evenings). As I listened to the stories of my parents' dorm lives, I never felt that it would be something I myself would have to face someday. But fate had reserved something else for me.

The period of denial occurs before one commits to the dorm life. ""I have never lived outside home! How can I stay in a dorm?"" the thought haunted me. But practical necessities forced me to take up residence in a random room that was allotted for me. And since then…

There was a brief period of sadness. I had never imagined myself in a scenario like this, but here I was, sharing a room with three different strangers. I looked at the unrecognisable ceilings, talking only when needed. It didn't take long to go from there to a place where my internal voice screamed, ""I WANNA GO HOME!""

After the initial phase of denial, I slowly realised that we were living, studying, sharing notes, borrowing each other's tools, and helping each other out every day without realising it consciously. And it's wasn't just my own room, either. The people living in the hall became the most familiar faces. It did feel like… home. That night, I never once thought I was doing it for someone else. My roommate felt like family.

Is family really the word for it? I can't think of any better. Leaving our loved ones elsewhere, dorms do create a new family for everyone, where you live with each other day-to-day and become more than friends. Not that there aren't any struggles, obviously. Just like a real family, a dorm family involves adjusting with people from different backgrounds, differing beliefs, and different habits. Nights where there are no classes the next day can result in a night-long storytelling epic, sharing one's most embarrassing moments, or emotional ones.

This is not to say I don't miss my home family. I really and sincerely do. And by romanticising my hall life doesn't mean I don't want to shy away from the fact that in many universities the dorm life is not so rosy, due to issues as ragging, student politics, etc. But these experiences have given me the privilege to create a new family in a safe place and for that, I'm extremely grateful to my new family members!

429,"The museum with nothing to show, but lots to see","A museum is a place to see things. This is a museum, paradoxically enough, you visit to not see.

My visit to the Dialog Museum in Frankfurt, Germany, a small establishment within a busy metro station, showed me things that we would never see in the light. In the lightless corridors of the museum, I experienced the vulnerabilities of blindness.

The museum's concept is fairly simple – a blind or visually impaired guide leads you through rooms with changing themes, all in the dark. You are put in the shoes of the blind. Absorbed into total darkness and immersed in blindness, you have no choice but to adapt and rely on your other senses.

The guide takes you through a dark corridor showing how to count money, cross the road, take the train, and much more, all without sight. Not seeing for 45 minutes has shown me the struggles of the person clutching onto a white stick, tapping it repeatedly against the asphalt trying to navigate.

The experience humbles you. It reminds you of your blessings of sight and of your obligation to someone who lacks it.

The museum I visited in Frankfurt is an initiative of Dialogue Social Enterprise (DSE). It is a social enterprise with a mission to promote inclusivity. Dialogue in the Dark (DiD) is an exhibition of theirs. DiD raises awareness for blind people by leaving a lasting impression on visitors. It also creates jobs for the visually impaired and the blind.

Bangladesh, according to some sources, accounts for roughly 2.2 percent of global blindness and 2.53 percent of global visual impairment. Needless to say, the visually impaired are neglected in our society, mainly due to a lack of awareness and empathy.

Setting up something like this in Bangladesh can show others what the Dialog Museum has shown me. It can raise awareness for the eight million people in Bangladesh struggling to cross the street. It will, eventually, lead to better accessibility and infrastructure for the visually impaired, and we can be a truly inclusive society.

430,Why sports are fun but studies are not,"A few days ago, as I was struggling to concentrate while juggling tasks, I rummaged through articles and videos to find a fix. I then landed on the concept of flow – a euphoric state of mind in which a person performing an activity becomes fully immersed in a feeling of energised focus. When we are in flow, our mind is entirely present in the moment, and hours seem to pass in minutes.

Learning about flow got me thinking about the age-old questions we all wonder – why are some activities fun while others aren't? Why do some of us enjoy sports so much but not studies? And why do some of us even enjoy studying at all?

On the surface, the answer seemed obvious. We are all different beings and have our own preferences. However, on a deeper level, I suspected there was something more to that. Perhaps it boils down to how distinctly we enter the flow state.

The idea of flow dates back thousands of years to ancient China. In Taoist philosophy, there is a concept known as ""Wu Wei"", translated paradoxically as the action of non-action. Modern positive psychology also studies flow with great interest. Psychologist Mihaly Csíkszentmihályi first coined the term ""flow"" and described the state as being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. To get into the flow state, the psychologist suggested we stretch our body or mind to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. In other words, the activity has to be challenging, and at the same time, we need to have the skill set required to carry through the task.

Some of us can enter the flow state while writing, some while playing a musical instrument, and some while solving a complex problem. But a large group of people finds flow when playing sports.

I asked one of my most sports-enthusiast friends how he feels in the field. He replied, ""I become so happy, I only think about the game forgetting all my problems and struggles.""

Interestingly, most of my friends, whom I consider sports enthusiasts, are top performers. They are ambitious and have the skills to back it up. As they meet both preconditions to enter the flow state, they can lose themselves in the field. For this very reason, those who ace academics are usually the ones who can absorb themselves in studying. A perfect combination of challenges and ability is what we need to enter flow. When we are in flow, we can concentrate intensely, which translates into superior performance and we tend to like that activity more.

Knowing why we like the things we like might tell us something significant about how to make things we don't like a bit less boring. When we lament about studies, it's often because we can't focus as we don't find the topics purposeful or don't have a basic understanding of them. Because it's easier said than done, I have something to say in this regard. Perhaps if we learn to see tasks we can't escape as challenges and start upgrading our skills, we can experience flow more often and lead a more fulfilled life.

431,Shamsin Ahmed is taking us all one step closer to a better tomorrow,"Shamsin Ahmed is the CEO and Lead Consultant of Identity Inclusion and the winner of this month's ""Stellar Women"" award a joint initiative of The Daily Star and BTI. Through Identity Inclusion's wide plethora of programmes, Identity Inclusion strives to do precisely what its name suggests – work towards creating a more inclusive society. Nonetheless, the mantra that fuels her vision is a challenge that most would deem insurmountable but through strategic planning, Shamsin works towards shattering the stigma around discussions of mental health as well as encouraging community-driven services that cater to the needs of disabled individuals.

The majority of society views disabled people through a lens of apprehension. They hold the belief that they are flawed and do not conform to the standards that warrant participation in society. Shamsin wants to break that mindset. She believes by giving the help these people need, we can build a world where they are accepted.

Shamsin and her team provide consultation services to some of the biggest NGOs. While her pursuit is noble, Shamsin started off with no institutional support and was even aware of the risks involved with working for the benefit of disabled people and mental health.

But where there's a will, there's a way. With multiple successful initiatives undertaken by Shamsin, her perseverance has been awe-inspiring.

One of her initiatives with Identity Inclusion involved working with BRAC and Underprivileged Children's Educational Programme (UCEP) Bangladesh. What Shamsin did was change policies, infrastructure, and roles of leadership to help quantify employment and inclusion for disabled people. Furthermore, she conducted sensitisation training to over 200 Regional Managers of BRAC to raise awareness and spread that knowledge among 27,000 field-level employees who work for BRAC's Microfinance program. But her work was not done yet. To ensure that she left a mark in all areas of the organisation, Shamsin ensured that 36 regional offices at BRAC was inclusive to disabled people.

The initiatives she undertakes are dictated by the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), four of which influenced her project with BRAC. They included quality education, decent work and economic growth, reduced inequalities, and sustainable cities and communities.

Another initiative of hers that involved developing a strategy for UCEP Bangladesh revolved around similar SDGs. She conducted multiple focus group discussions to address the need to develop a national strategy for menstrual hygiene management.

Yet another noteworthy project of hers involved organisation sessions at CARE and Oxfam Bangladesh. With the aid of these sessions, Identity Inclusion sought to raise awareness about mental health and self-harm prevention measures.

In a time where it often feels like the world is a gloomy place, people like her light it up with their beacon of hope. With Identity Inclusion, she has already worked towards breaking the taboo around discourses of mental health in the workplace.

But it has not only been contained within offices, as Shamsin conducts workshops through the aid of media content in schools as well. And while she spreads word about the need to be more accepting in all spheres of life, she follows it up with action as well. By establishing inclusive youth leadership opportunities through her own firm, as well as consulting for sustainable changes, Shamsin proves that she is willing to go above and beyond to fully realise her vision.

Due to her valiant efforts, Shamsin received a Special Mention from the late Dhaka North City Corporation mayor, Annisul Haque. Shamsin is an inspiration to many people. Not only does her work aid hundreds, if not thousands of people, but it takes us all one step closer to dismantling barriers that never should have existed in the first place. That is precisely what makes Shamsin Ahmed worthy of the ""Stellar Woman"" award.

""I am humbled and grateful for this recognition of my work. I hope this award will inspire more women like me who do not carry conventional traits of leadership and realise that quiet strength works too,"" she said on winning the ""Stellar Woman"" award.",2023-02-22 11:39:06,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-youth/news/shamsin-ahmed-taking-us-all-one-step-closer-better-tomorrow-3254446,2023-05-18 10:27:38,thedailystar
432,"In conversation with Mike Henniger, CEO and President at Illume Student Advisory Services","Mike Henniger visited Bangladesh recently to attend ""Canada Application Day"", organised by Osprey Education Canada Inc. and Eduproof Inc. The Daily Star sat down with him for a brief conversation.

The Daily Star: Why is it important for institutions to recruit international students?

Mike Henniger: It is extremely important to internationalise universities and colleges, and to have an international mindset for all students, faculty and staff. There is no real area of study that does not have international and cultural implications. Take the Business and Economics Faculty, if they do not have international students and faculty members, it limits the general perspective because we know that the world is a global village, economies are global, and businesses are international.

DS: How do you think Bangladeshi students can benefit from an education abroad?

MH: When I look at the countries and universities that I represent, I know they are providing world-class education in sectors like Environmental Sustainability to Economics or Social Justice. I think Canada is a leader in many of those fields, and Bangladesh needs to continue to advance in those sectors. Many of the students studying at the institutions we represent will be able to come back to Bangladesh and be future leaders.

DS: What are some of the challenges prospective international students from Bangladesh face when applying abroad? What are some of the things they should be aware of?

MH: I think one of the biggest challenges is that related to budget. Unfortunately, international study is expensive. Many students look for scholarship opportunities that often are unavailable.

For many, the realisation that they want to study abroad comes later in life. Most of these people are excellent students that the universities would be more than happy to accept, but because of study gaps or because they have dependents, it can often be difficult to obtain a Canadian visa.

When that happens, it is important that the student remains true to their dreams. I believe it is important to carve out an academic life and career path, instead of finding ways to just get to Canada or any other country. It will also allow institutions and immigration officials to understand the student's story and help them actualise their dreams.

Knowing the basics, and not outsourcing your education choice will go a long way. Researching about the faculty, entry requirements or job outcomes will make sure that the student is making the right choice.

DS: Can you talk about some of the shortcomings in the current application process? How can students get around those shortcomings to make sure their profiles are being accurately judged?

MH: Universities and colleges pride themselves with inclusivity, but often we do not do a great job and end up putting up more barriers. There is a constant effort to try to make education easier to access, but certain problems still persist, such as those related to proof of English proficiency and shorter degrees.

It is my personal belief that in academia, all the importance is put in a student's grades, even though we know that a student's skills in terms of conflict resolution, and their ability to gain different experiences in life are more influential. We often do not measure these things. However, many programs are now looking at a more holistic approach, so I believe we are headed in a direction.",2023-02-16 11:39:23,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-youth/news/conversation-mike-henniger-ceo-and-president-illume-student-advisory-services-3249656,2023-05-18 10:27:40,thedailystar
433,St. Joseph and Scholastica Uttara win at Scholastica Interschool Debate Tournament,"On January 6, Scholastica Debate Club returned with their flagship event ""Scholastica Interschool Debate Tournament (SIDT)"".

434,"4 kids, including baby, found alive in Amazon after plane crash","This handout picture released by the Colombian Army shows a crashed plane in the forest at a rural area of the municipality of Solano, department of Caqueta, Colombia on May 16, 2023/AFP

Four Indigenous children, including an 11-month-old baby, have been found alive in the dense Colombian Amazon after a plane crash more than two weeks ago, President Gustavo Petro said Wednesday, declaring ""joy for the country.""

Petro shared the news on Twitter, saying the children were discovered after ""arduous search efforts"" by the military.

Authorities had deployed more than 100 soldiers with sniffer dogs to search for the minors who were traveling in an airplane that crashed on May 1, killing three adults.

Rescuers believe the children -- who in addition to the 11-month-old included a 13, 9, and 4 year old -- have been wandering through the jungle in the southern Caqueta department since the crash.

Earlier Wednesday, the armed forces said that search efforts intensified after rescuers came across a ""shelter built in an improvised way with sticks and branches,"" leading them to believe there were survivors.

In photographs released by the armed forces, scissors and a hair tie could be seen among branches on the jungle floor.

Previously, a baby's drinking bottle and a half-eaten piece of fruit had been found.

On Monday and Tuesday, soldiers found the bodies of the pilot and two adults who had been flying from a jungle location to San Jose del Guaviare, one of the main cities in Colombia's Amazon rainforest.

One of the dead passengers, Ranoque Mucutuy, was the mother of the four children, who are from the Huitoto ethnicity.

- Inaccessible region -

Giant trees that can grow up to 40 meters tall, wild animals and heavy rainfall made the ""Operation Hope"" search difficult.

Three helicopters have been used to help, one of which blasted out a recorded message from the children's grandmother in the Huitoto language telling them to stop moving through the jungle.

Authorities have not indicated what caused the plane crash.

The pilot had reported problems with the engine just minutes before the airplane disappeared from radars, Colombia's disaster response body said.

It is a region with few roads that is also difficult to access by river, so airplane transport is common.

The Huitoto, also spelled Witoto, are known for living in harmony with the remote jungle, and for their hunting, fishing and gathering skills which may have helped the children to survive.

Exploitation, disease and assimilation have reduced the population sharply over many decades.

Petro, who announced the rescue, is Colombia's first leftist president.

He came to power last August but has been unable to usher in the fundamental reforms in labor law, healthcare, pensions and the judiciary that he promised during his campaign.",2023-05-18 02:17:24,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/world/news/4-kids-including-baby-found-alive-amazon-after-plane-crash-3323081,2023-05-18 10:27:42,thedailystar
435,30 journalists confined for taking photos of AL-BCL clash in Barishal,"At least 30 journalists were confined after they took photos of a clash that broke out between Awami League and Chhatra League men in Barishal yesterday.

Later, they were freed following interventions by senior leaders.

The melee broke out between two factions of Awami League and Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) after a meeting of public representatives of Sadar upazila with Awami League candidate Abul Khair Abdullah Khokon Serniabat regarding Barishal City Corporation election last night.

The incident happened at the residence of Jubo League joint convener Mahmudul Haque Khan Mamun.

According to eyewitnesses, followers of Khokon Serniabat, Awami League leader Shahidul Islam and District Chhatra League vice-president Zobayer Abdullah Jinnah got involved in a dispute over the distribution of packets and giving speeches after the opinion exchange meeting of the AL-backed mayoral candidate. Then there was a scuffle between the two groups.

The 30 journalists were confined by supporters of Shahidul and Jinnah, when they went there to take photos of the clash. Later, the situation calmed down with the intervention of senior leaders, said the eyewitnesses.

Azim Sharif, cameraperson of Asian Television, said, ""BCL men hit our cameras when we went to film the scuffle. We also had a fight over this. At one point, about 30-35 of my colleagues, including I, were locked in a room. Later, senior leaders of Awami League came and freed us.""

These two groups have done such things to embarrass the candidate of the boat, said AL leaders.

Jubair Abdullah Jinnah, vice-president of the district Chhatra League, said, ""The conversation was over trivial issues and nothing else.""

Mahmudul Haque Khan Mamun, joint convener of the Metropolitan Jubo League, said there was a problem over trivial issues.

436,Legal notice sent to Bidyanondo Foundation seeking clarification on donation,"Says SC lawyer

A woman has sent a legal notice to Kishore Kumar Das, chairman of the Bidyananda Foundation, seeking information on how her donation to the foundation was spent.

Supreme Court lawyer Md Haider Tanviruzzaman said yesterday that the notice was issued on Tuesday on behalf of Sabiha Rahman Nitu, who had donated to the charitable organisation.

Through the legal notice, the donor has asked the foundation to provide information on how the donated money was spent within 30 days.

Otherwise, legal recourse will be taken, the notice states.

According to the legal notice, the donor gave Tk 40,500 to the foundation in three phases through banks and bKash to contribute to social work.

However, various allegations against Bidyanondo Foundation -- including financial irregularities and improper use of donation funds -- have been circulating in different newspapers and on social media.

According to the notice, although the audit report made clear the scope of all expenses, the donor did not get information about the money she donated in the audit. And there was no satisfactory response from the foundation despite repeated requests regarding the matter.

Bidyanondo Foundation, which is known for distributing food to thousands of underprivileged people under the 'Ek Takay Ahar' project, started its journey in 2013.

Following the Bongobazar fire last month, the foundation announced to stand by the traders by making and selling products -- made with the burnt clothes recovered from the fire -- including children's clothes and jewellery.

However, a Facebook post containing collage photos of various products -- that the organisation claimed have been made from burnt clothes recovered from the Bongobazar fire -- sparked a criticism on the internet. People took to social media accusing the foundation of promoting another woman entrepreneur's work as its own.

The foundation's chairman Kishore Kumar Das, however, denied the allegations.

""An attempt was made to make these jewellery after seeing some pictures of some jewellery made by a woman entrepreneur,"" he said. ""However, while publishing the collage picture on Bidyananda's Facebook page, photos of some jewellery made by the woman entrepreneur were also published,"" he said.

Following the criticism, the foundation removed the post from its official Facebook page and issued an apology.",2023-05-17 19:11:55,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/rights/news/legal-notice-sent-bidyanondo-foundation-seeking-clarification-donation-3322971,2023-05-18 10:27:44,thedailystar
437,Helmets cannot be marketed without BSTI nod: home minister,"Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said yesterday that no helmet can be marketed without the certification of the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI).

The minister said: ""Bike riders are often involved in accidents. Statistics show that more motorcycles are involved in accidents than buses and trucks. That's why we want to ensure the quality of the helmets of the drivers and riders.""

""We have decided that helmets -- made at home or imported-- will only be marketed after the certification of the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI).

He made these remarks in a press conference after a meeting of a task force formed to strengthen discipline in the road transport sector and control accidents.

Drawing attention to the fact that BRTA is already conducting drives against unauthorised helmets, the minister said, ""We are taking steps to implement it better.""

Permission must be obtained before marketing, he added.

During his speech, the minister said service charges or donations cannot be collected from any place except terminals.

""Charges, tolls, and fees cannot be collected anywhere other than the city corporation's designated terminals,"" he said. ""In other districts without a city corporation, these service fees may be collected at locations designated by the municipality or deputy commissioner.""

The minister warned of legal consequences against those who extort money from people on the roads.

He also said those who want to set up driving training schools will require a BRTA licence.

""The ones that are currently operational will be monitored by BRTA. They can continue running those training schools only after getting the approval,"" he said.

Dhaka Wasa Managing Director Taqsem A Khan has turned the state-run agency into ""a den of corruption"", according to an allegation made by Dhaka Wasa Chairman Gholam Mostafa.

Taqsem runs the administration in an autocratic manner, bypassing the board, Mostafa wrote in a letter to the secretary of the local government ministry yesterday.

He brought several other allegations against Taqsem, and sought directives from the secretary.

Only five days ago, three associations of employees of Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority wrote to the LGRD ministry demanding immediate action against Mostafa for ""tarnishing the image of Wasa"" on a TV talk show.

In yesterday's letter, the board chairman said as per the Wasa Act-1996, there is an obligation to convene a board meeting every two months. But the managing director often ignores this obligation.

After Mostafa's talk show appearance, Taqsem, who was abroad at that time, tried to force the employees to form human chains against Mostafa. After he failed to do so, Taqsem had employee associations file a complaint against him with the LGRD ministry, read the letter.

Mostafa's letter read, ""The list of his [Taqsem's] irregularities and misrule is so long that it is not possible to write them here.""

Taqsem runs Wasa as he wishes and the internal situation in Dhaka Wasa is very bad, read the letter.

""He terminated those who raised voices against him. Hundreds of such incidents happened in the past. Therefore, no one dares to speak against him for fear of getting fired. A government agency cannot run this way.

""Dhaka Wasa is being run bypassing the board and the board's decision,"" it added.

Local farmers said production of the fruit was badly hampered due to the drought like situation and lack of adequate rainfall.

As a result, most of the litchi trees could not flowered during the flowering season, while the sizes of fruit is also smaller than the usual one.

Moreover, wild animals like squirrels, bats and different kinds of birds often damaging the litchi, forcing many growers to sell their unripe litchi in advance.

Abdus Shahid, a fruit seller in Moulvibazar town, said currently there is no quality litchi available in the market as the area hardly saw any rainfall during the flowering of the fruit that has a high demand.

The additional security for some countries, including the US and the UK, will be restoredif they want it but they must pay for the facility, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said yesterday.

""There was a reign of terror here when we saw the rise of militants… At that time, we used to give protection to only four embassies. They didn't write to us and no requests were made either. We gave them [additional security] so that they face no trouble,"" the minister said.

""We think that situation doesn't exist any more. That's why we have withdrawn this protection. However, if an ambassador thinks it will be needed, the new Ansar Guard Regiment will give protection… They have to pay the cost and we will arrange it for them accordingly. That's how it has been decided.""

The minister made the statement in response to a question after a meeting of a taskforce, formed to implement recommendations on ensuring discipline in the road transport sector and curbing accidents. The meeting was held at the conference room of the home ministry.

""I reiterate that we have police protection in every embassy. Gunmen are also there for the four ambassadors I spoke about. There are all kinds of protection. The protection we used to give only on the road has been withdrawn. I think I've made it clear."" — Asaduzzaman Khan Home Minister

China considers self-ruled Taiwan to be its territory, to be taken one day by force if necessary, and strongly opposes any formal engagement with the island, including by high-profile foreign political figures.

Truss, who is on a five-day visit to Taiwan, accused Sunak and other Western governments of ""trying to cling on to the idea that we can cooperate with China on issues like climate change, as if there is nothing wrong"".

447,Thai parties meet for coalition talks to form govt,"Thai opposition groups met for coalition talks yesterday after hammering government rivals at the ballot box, but some junta-appointed senators warned they would try to stop the victorious party's leader from becoming prime minister.

The progressive Move Forward Party (MFP) emerged from Sunday's election as the biggest party after voters emphatically rejected nearly a decade of military-backed rule.

MFP leader Pita Limjaroenrat met senior officials from five other opposition parties at a Bangkok restaurant, posing for photos before ushering them inside for closed-door talks.

Pita, 42, is trying to build an alliance with Pheu Thai -- the party that has dominated Thai politics for two decades -- and four smaller groups.

MFP claimed 152 seats, with Pheu Thai second on 141. Allying with the other parties would give them more than 300 of the 500 lower house seats.

But to secure the prime minister's job the coalition needs a majority across both houses -- including the Senate, whose 250 members were handpicked by the previous junta.

MFP and its allies need 376 lower house votes to ensure senators could not block Pita from becoming prime minister.

Some senators have already voiced opposition to him, rattled by his strong anti-establishment stance that includes plans to amend the kingdom's tough royal insult laws.

""I will not accept Pita as a PM,"" Senator Jadet Inswang said, raising concerns about lese-majeste reform.

Senator Kittisak Ratanawaraha also declined to support Pita.",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/asia/news/thai-parties-meet-coalition-talks-form-govt-3322871,2023-05-18 10:27:56,thedailystar
448,Next five years set to be hottest period ever: UN,"It is near-certain that 2023-2027 will be the warmest five-year period ever recorded, the United Nations warned as greenhouse gases and El Nino combine to send temperatures soaring.

Global temperatures are soon set to exceed the more ambitious target set out in the Paris climate accords, with a two-thirds chance that one of the next five years will do so, the UN's World Meteorological Organization said Tuesday.

The hottest eight years ever recorded were all between 2015 and 2022 -- but temperatures are forecast to increase further as climate change accelerates.

""There is a 98-percent likelihood that at least one of the next five years, and the five-year period as a whole, will be the warmest on record,"" the WMO said.

The 2015 Paris Agreement saw countries agree to cap global warming at ""well below"" two degrees Celsius above average levels measured between 1850 and 1900 -- and 1.5C if possible.

The global mean temperature in 2022 was 1.15C above the 1850-1900 average.

The WMO said there was a 66 percent chance that annual global surface temperatures will exceed 1.5C above pre-industrial levels for at least one of the years 2023-2027, with a range of 1.1C to 1.8C forecasted for each of those five years.

While this does not mean that the world will permanently exceed the Paris benchmark, ""WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency"", said the agency's chief Petteri Taalas.

""A warming El Nino is expected to develop in the coming months and this will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory.

""This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment. We need to be prepared.""

El Nino is the large-scale warming of surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The weather phenomenon normally occurs every two to seven years.

Conditions oscillate between El Nino and its opposite La Nina, with neutral conditions in between.

The WMO said earlier this month that the chances of El Nino developing were 60 percent by the end of July and 80 percent by the end of September.

Typically, El Nino increases global temperatures in the year after it develops -- which in this cycle would be 2024.

Despite the cooling influence of La Nina conditions over much of the past three years, the warmest eight years on record have all been from 2015 onwards, with 2016 the hottest.

Heat gets trapped in the atmosphere by so-called greenhouse gases, which are at a record high.

The three major greenhouses gases are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.

Temperatures in 2023 are likely to be higher than the 1991-2020 average in almost all regions except for Alaska, South Africa, South Asia and parts of Australia, the WMO said.

Parts of the South Pacific Ocean are likely to be cooler than average.",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/world/news/next-five-years-set-be-hottest-period-ever-un-3322866,2023-05-18 10:27:57,thedailystar
449,"Unaffected by Dhaka’s relations with Beijing, Moscow","Says state dept official

US Deputy Assistant Secretary Afreen Akhter has said Washington DC does not define its relationship with Dhaka taking into account Bangladesh's ties with Russia and China or any other country.

She said this in an interview with the BSS in Dhaka this week.

Afreen said the US has a multi-dimensional relationship with Bangladesh, and it found a lot of synergies as Dhaka recently released its Indo-Pacific Outlook (IPO) that had many elements in common with the US Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS).

""Broadly, we see a lot of synergies between our two documents, our strategy, and your outlook. We both are focused on building economic prosperity in the region and through infrastructure, through our substantial development projects,"" said the senior state department official.

Her comments came months after US Ambassador in Dhaka Peter Haas said Washington DC does not force countries to choose sides over relationships with other countries and particularly with China.

Afreen thanked Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for her recent joint statement with her Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida ""condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a violation of international law and the UN charter"".

The US diplomat said Bangladesh's IPO laid emphasis on the ""maritime security"" issue that was a key focus of the US and the other QUAD partners and that's why the US would look for opportunities to continue to collaborate on that.

The deputy assistant secretary also said Washington DC was concerned about the application of the Digital Security Act and particularly ""where the law has been applied"".

RAB SANCTIONS

Afreen said Washington DC was pleased to see ""a substantial decrease in extrajudicial killings"" after its sanction on the Rapid Action Battalion.

""We welcome that decrease... [but] we need to see a long time sustained trend, positive changes of behaviour [in Rab],"" she said, adding that Washington DC focused on ensuring accountability, reform and transparency of the force.

She said the US needs to see long term systemic change for removal of sanctions to be considered.

Talking about the Rohingya, the state department official said her country was working to find a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis through their repatriation to Myanmar under right conditions, a task she termed ""difficult and challenging"".

""We believe very firmly that the conditions in Myanmar right now do not warrant a safe, voluntary, dignified return and so we would oppose any effort to forcibly repatriate individuals to Myanmar,"" she added.",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/asia/china/news/unaffected-dhakas-relations-beijing-moscow-3322861,2023-05-18 10:27:58,thedailystar

451,Resale Of Russian Oil: EU should crack down on India,"Says bloc’s diplomatic chief

The European Union should crack down on India reselling Russian oil into Europe as refined fuel, including diesel, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in an interview with the Financial Times published on Tuesday.

India has emerged in the past year as a top buyer of Russian oil following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Access to cheap Russian crude has boosted output and profits at Indian refineries, enabling them to export refined products competitively to Europe and take a bigger market share.

Borrell told the newspaper he would raise the issue with India's foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, at a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday.

""If diesel or gasoline is entering Europe ... coming from India and being produced with Russian oil, that is certainly a circumvention of sanctions and member states have to take measures,"" the EU's chief diplomat said.

""That India buys Russian oil, it's normal... But if they use that in order to be a centre where Russian oil is being refined and by-products are being sold to us... we have to act,"" Borrell said.

In remarks after the meeting, Borrell said he had brought up Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including the issue of food security, in his talks with Jaishankar, but his remarks did not refer to Russian oil.

Jaishankar told a news conference his understanding of EU sanctions rules was that Russian crude substantially transformed in a third country was no longer considered to be a Russian product.

European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager said the EU would have a discussion with India on the issue ""but it will be with an extended hand and of course not with a pointed finger"".

Indian refiners, which rarely bought Russian oil previously due to high transport costs, imported 970,000-981,000 bpd of it in fiscal 2022/23 (April-March), accounting for more than a fifth of the country's overall fuel imports.

Russia's largest oil producer Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and top Indian refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS) have also signed a term deal to substantially increase and diversify oil grades delivered to India.

According to ship-tracking data from Kpler, Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) and Nayara Energy were the key exporters of refined fuels and buyers of Russian oil.

No immediate response was available from the companies.

India typically exported an average of 154,000 barrels per day (bpd) of diesel and jet fuel to Europe before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, that has increased to 200,000 bpd after the EU banned Russian oil products imports from Feb. 5 this year, data from Kpler shows.

Any mechanism to stem the flow of Russian oil would need to be implemented by the national authorities, Borrell told the FT, suggesting that the EU could target buyers of Indian refined fuels which it believes are derived from Russian crude.

""If they sell, it is because someone is buying. And we have to look at who is buying,"" he said.",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/world/news/resale-russian-oil-eu-should-crack-down-india-3322851,2023-05-18 10:28:01,thedailystar

453,"Matarbari Deep Sea Port: It’ll boost GDP, create 9 lakh jobs","Claims SANEM study; Japanese envoy says support to continue regardless of who’s in power here

The Matarbari deep seaport, which is set to start operation in 2026, will help Bangladesh accelerate its GDP growth by an additional 1.14 percentage points and create nine lakh jobs, says a study.

Bangladesh's first deep sea port in Cox's Bazar and the other related regional connectivity projects can also help the country tackle the challenges of its LDC graduation, it said.

The study was jointly conducted by the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (SANEM) and Shillong-based Indian think tank Asian Confluence

Selim Raihan, executive director of SANEM and also an economics professor at Dhaka University, presented the study on the impact of Matarbari port at a policy conference at the capital's North South University (NSU) yesterday.

The Center for Peace Studies (CPS) of the South Asian Institute of Policy and Governance (SIPG) at the NSU organised the event titled ""From the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal: New Possibilities in the Bangladesh, Japan, India Trilateral Partnership"".

During Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's recent visit to Japan, the countries discussed the creation of industrial value chain and connectivity to the Northeastern India and southeastern Bangladesh centering the Matarbari port. Japan is implementing the port project.

Prof Selim said the Matarbari port will facilitate berthing of ships with a draft of more than 16 metres, compared to those of 9.5 metres in Chattogram Port. This would significantly reduce the travel time and distance for carrying goods, making trade more viable, he added.

He said there are still significant challenges to developing infrastructures for connecting the Northeastern India with Bangladesh and building inland and overland transportation networks.

With the India-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in operation and Bangladesh planning CEPA with India and Japan, a trilateral free trade zone would eventually emerge in the near future, Selim told the programme.

""The Matarbari deep sea port will significantly reduce the travel time and distance for carrying goods, making trade more viable."" — Selim Raihan Executive Director of SANEM

The SANEM executive director suggested India and Bangladesh scale up the multi-modal connectivity, bring synergy in trade facilitation and build express corridors for transshipment and transit of goods from the Northeast of India to Chattogram and Matarbari and vice versa.

Speaking at the event, Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen said Matarbari deep sea port along with the other ports in Payra, Mongla and Chattogram, and other connectivity to India, Nepal, Bhutan and Asean can help Bangladesh achieve 10 percent GDP growth, which is required for the country to become a developed nation by 2041.

Japanese companies are already in the process of investing in the Japan-built special economic zone in Araihazar of Narayanganj, Masud said.

The foreign secretary said Indian companies are expected to invest in Bangladesh, with more opportunities being created.

Japanese Ambassador to Bangladesh Iwama Kiminori said his country will continue carrying out development activities in Bangladesh like it has been doing for 50 years, regardless of who is in power in Bangladesh.

Asked about Bangladesh's elections, he said he won't comment on the matter.

Prof Shahidul Haque of SIPG said both Japan and India are very close and strategic partners of Bangladesh, and global shift in geopolitics has catalysed the three countries for the trilateral initiative.

""We also need to improve people-to-people cooperation,"" he said.

NSU Associate Prof Jashim Uddin said the trilateral cooperation involving the Matarbari port may be a matter of concern for China, but Bangladesh can surely do whatever needs to be done in its national interest.

Unless Bangladesh joins any military alliance, there should not be any major issue from China's perspective, he added.

Asian Confluence Executive Director Sabyasachi Dutta and NSU Vice Chancellor Prof Atiqul Islam also spoke at the event, moderated by NSU Prof Sk Tawfique M Haque.",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/diplomacy/news/matarbari-deep-sea-port-itll-boost-gdp-create-9-lakh-jobs-3322841,2023-05-18 10:28:03,thedailystar
454,"Pakistan Violence: Imran says cops surround his house, fears re-arrest","Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan said yesterday that police had surrounded his house and that he expected to be rearrested soon, after the government warned him to hand over supporters who it blamed for attacks on the army.

Khan was arrested by the army on May 9 on graft allegations, which he denies, triggering a wave of violence that has deepened political instability in the South Asian nation of 220 million. Pakistan has also been facing its worst ever economic crisis, with a long delay in securing critical IMF funding.

The country's Supreme Court ordered Khan's release on bail last Friday.

But yesterday the government accused him of sheltering aides and supporters wanted over the attacks following his arrest, and warned he had 24 hours to hand them over or face a police operation.

Khan, 70, a former captain of Pakistan's cricket team, said his re-arrest was imminent. Hours earlier, Islamabad's High Court had granted him a bail extension until May 31, his lawyer Faisal Chaudhry said.

""Probably my last tweet before my next arrest,"" Khan tweeted yesterday evening, adding that police had surrounded his house in the eastern city of Lahore.

In a live video statement, he said his opponents were out to trigger a fight between him and the army.

""I'm afraid that this will bring a big backlash that will cause huge loss to our country,"" he said. ""... If someone thinks that this strategy can win a ban on my party, it is not going to happen.""

He demanded a judicial commission headed by the chief justice to probe the violence.

Punjab province's information minister Amir Mir said intelligence and law enforcement agencies had identified that some 30 to 40 people accused of attacking military installations were hiding at Khan's home.

""We're giving an ultimatum that these terrorists should be turned over to the police, or else there will be action,"" Mir told a press conference. He said Khan had 24 hours to surrender the suspects, and that a police operation would be launched if he did not comply.

Khan's aide, Iftikhar Durrani, denied the former PM was sheltering people suspected of involvement in the violence.

Khan, who has been rallying his supporters to demand a snap election since he was ousted in a parliamentary vote of confidence in April 2022, called on authorities to come to his house with arrest warrants rather than storming it.

Following Khan's arrest, thousands of supporters attacked and set on fire scores of government and public buildings, including the army's headquarters. More than 3,000 people are already in custody over the violence.

Federal Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb described the attacks on army installations as ""sedition"" saying those involved in them would be tried in military courts.

The military had already announced that those who attacked its installations would be tried under army laws, calling the May 9 attacks ""pre-planned"" and ordered by leaders of Khan's party, which he and his party deny.",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/asia/south-asia/news/pakistan-violence-imran-says-cops-surround-his-house-fears-re-arrest-3322836,2023-05-18 10:28:04,thedailystar
455,Action against those selling drugs at higher price,"DGDA decides in meeting

Law enforcement agencies will take action if anyone sells drugs and other medical products at a higher price than the one fixed by the drug administration.

The Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) decided this at a meeting yesterday after it was instructed by the prime minister's office recently to take measures to reduce the ""excessive price hike"" of drugs and medical equipment.

Representatives of pharmaceutical companies, medical product importers, consumers and law enforcement agencies attended the meeting with Maj Gen Mohammad Yousuf, DGDA director general, in the chair.

The meeting concluded that the recent price hike is not ""excessive"" since it was done to adjust the depreciation of the taka against the US dollar, Yousuf told reporters after the meeting.

On June 30 last year, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare hiked the prices of 53 out of 117 essential medicines by 13 to 75 percent.

Prices of around 1,500 generic medicines and all other medical equipment -- which are indicated by DGDA based on the demand of the companies -- were also hiked at different times accordingly.

""No one in the meeting could place any proof that the price has been hiked excessively. But we will find a way if there is an option to reduce the price,"" said Yousuf.

DGDA will also write to the National Board of Revenue for tax and other duty exemptions on medical imports and to the health ministry to revise the price fixation rule for drugs and other medical products, he added.

According to sources, the health ministry will arrange a meeting of the ""medicine price fixation committee"" based on the recommendation made at yesterday's meeting.

A summary of reports from the prime minister's office and the Special Branch of Police, including a 17-point recommendation was also discussed in the meeting. This newspaper obtained a copy of the recommendations, which was annexed with a letter sent by the health ministry to DGDA on May 9 for discussion.

The recommendations highlighted weak market surveillance, raw material crisis due to the dollar price hike, and aggressive marketing by pharmaceutical companies. It also included establishing DGDA's authority to fix prices of all medicines in addition to the 117 essential medicines, increasing the supply of high-demand medicines, reducing unnecessary packaging costs, etc.

""Stopping aggressive marketing is a policy-related issue dealing with which the ministry should take the lead. A proposal has been sent to the ministry a year ago in this regard,"" said the DGDA director general.

Humayun Kabir Bhuiyan, general secretary of Consumer Association of Bangladesh, also attended the meeting.

""The meeting was to discuss ways to reduce the price. However, no conclusive recommendations were made in this regard other than discussing the rising production cost,"" he told The Daily Star, following the meeting.",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/action-against-those-selling-drugs-higher-price-3322831,2023-05-18 10:28:06,thedailystar

Two soldiers of the Bangladesh Army were killed and two officers injured in an attack of Kuki-Chin National Army members in Bandarban's Ruma upazila on Tuesday, said the Inter Services Public Relations in a press release yesterday.

The KNA members detonated an improvised explosive device (IED) and opened fire on the army personnel, the release said.

The release did not contain the identities of the deceased.

The incident took place when an army patrol team led by Major Monowar on Tuesday left Sungsungpara army camp after receiving information about a hideout of armed criminals in Jarulchharipara.

As the team reached near Jarulchharipara around 1:55pm, the KNA criminals detonated the IED and started firing indiscriminately, leaving two officers and two soldiers injured, it added.

The injured were flown to Combined Military Hospital, Chittagong, where the two soldiers died of their injuries, said the ISPR release, adding that the injured officers are receiving treatment at the hospital.

In recent times, the KNA has been trying to create a chaotic environment through criminal activities in the deep forests of Ruma, Rowangchhari and Thanchi upazilas of Bandarban, it added.

Foreign ministry officials said this at a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on foreign affairs yesterday.

There, the officials placed a progress report, which mentioned what role the Bangladeshi missions have been playing to prevent the spread of anti-state propaganda.

In the nine-point progress report, they said the missions are always active in protesting and responding to the propaganda through the foreign ministries of the respective countries.

However, they also said the list prepared by the home ministry carries no specific details.

The foreign ministry officials added that the missions abroad have been clearly instructed to appeal to the governments of the countries concerned to try the perpetrators of anti-state activities under their existing laws.

Bangladesh ambassadors and high commissioners in those countries have also been instructed to regularly monitor the activities of the listed persons or organisations and inform the authorities of any social media posts, content, news or information that are harmful and defamatory to the government or against the Bangladesh's interests.

Steps are already being taken to ensure that informative and objective news are regularly published in the international media to counter misinformation and promote a positive image for Bangladesh, the report said.

Fifty-one percent of the capital's poor people had slid into poverty because of the lingering fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, according to a survey by Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies.

The survey conducted on 2,046 households said 22.24 percent of Dhaka city's population was poor in 2022 and more than half of the poor people were ""new poor"".

The capital city currently has a population of over 1.02 crore, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics data from last year.

Addressing the BIDS Research Almanac 2023 at a hotel yesterday, the institute's Director General Binayak Sen said, ""Evidence shows that the new poor, as a new social category, is emerging as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.""

Steps must be taken to keep people from becoming poor, he said while presenting a paper titled ""Urban Poverty Dynamics During Covid-19: Anatomy of Resilience"".

He added that from 2019 to 2022, the number of poor people in the capital fell by 4.3 percentage points from 26.54 percent.

Besides, the proportion of extremely poor households declined from 17.01 percent to 13.83 percent during the period.

The reduction of poverty happened due to self-employment, social safety net programmes and charity, and utilisation of savings by individuals, Binayak Sen said.

He said digital technology like mobile financial services played a positive role in creating self-employment.

During the pandemic, some researchers said the number of poor people doubled, he said, adding that their studies were done in a hurry.

But the BIDS study found that poverty increased in the first few months of the pandemic and then started to decline, he added.

He said digital technology like mobile banking services played a positive role in creating self-employment.

""However, the number of new poor rose, and the government should work on it.""

Planning Minister MA Mannan said disparity was rising as the economy was growing.

The government is trying to reduce disparity through social safety net programmes that directly benefit the poor, he added.

Thanks to government initiatives, extreme poverty has fallen, he added while addressing the event as the chief guest.

Satyajit Karmaker, secretary at the planning ministry, also spoke at the event.",2023-05-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/51pc-dhakas-poor-are-new-3322806,2023-05-18 10:28:10,thedailystar

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said the Awami League has successfully been able to retain its popularity even though it has been in power for a long time.

""Staying in power for a long time, a very few parties or men can sustain popularity or work for the welfare of the people continuously, but the Awami League has been able to do so. We've proved it,"" she said.

The premier, also the AL president, said this when a group of leaders of the ruling party and its associate bodies greeted her at the Gono Bhaban on the occasion of her 43rd homecoming day.

On May 17, 1981, Hasina returned home from India after nearly six years in exile following the assassination of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members on August 15, 1975.

About the AL's steps to establish democracy and voting rights, and reform the electoral system, Hasina said those who once rigged votes are now vocal about democracy and voting rights in the country.

""Those who were the thieves and robbers of votes [in the past] now want democracy and are talking about voting rights. They were born in an illegal way. But we are to hear such words from them.""

The AL chief asked her party leaders and activists not to considersuch political rhetoric seriously. She said they shouldrather stay by the people and work for them to change their fortune.

""We'll have to retain the confidence of the people. The trust of the people is our only source of power. We've no other power except it.""

Hasina asked the AL members to reorganise the party and its associate bodies.

She said the AL is the only party that thinks about the welfare of Bangladesh while the others are plunderers.

The PM said Bangladesh has gained success in every area, including saving the environment, food production or protection of human rights, curbing militancy and terrorism. Bangladesh has also been able to show this success before the world, she said.

""Since we've truly developed the country with limited resources, Bangladesh is now a role model for development.""

So, the anti-liberation elements, war criminals, their successors and local and international patrons would not like this progress of Bangladesh, she said.

Hasina recalled the days when she returned home from exile and remembered those who helped her during those tough days.

""It has been found from relevant documents that one of the owners of illegal brick kilns has been jailed for a month while other such offenders have only been fined.

476,Creeps and stalkers consider filing lawsuit due to mental trauma caused by friend request glitch,"If there's anything Facebook is known for other than being a habitat for creepy internet stalkers, it's the weird glitches the platform comes up with every once in a while, and the sea of legal trouble it faces. However, the powerful forces met again yesterday as a glitch on the social media platform started sending out friend requests automatically to profiles visited by its users, causing a nightmare for internet stalkers.

""I was on my usual stalking spree, visiting the profile of that random girl in my university who asked me for a pen once during an exam and so I assumed she was in love with me,"" said Shadman Sakib, Jinish World Record holder for the most restraining orders issued against a person, ""Her profile might be locked but my eyes aren't. I suddenly noticed that I had sent her a friend request. My worst nightmare came true since it made me look like a desperate and pathetic creep. Sure, I might actually be one in real life but if I can't hide my true self on social media, is there even a point of being on the platform?""

""Soon, I realised that the glitch had accidentally sent friend requests to all the profiles I had stalked that night. All the girls I was in love with! All 81 of them,"" cried Shadman, ""And then the inevitable happened. They either blocked me or ignored my friend request. I knew I didn't have a chance with them to begin with but I didn't need that sort of a reality check in my life at such a young age.""

Having learnt nothing after multiple rejections, Shadman then decided that the only way to move on from this is to sue a multi-billion-dollar company.

""I might have not been able to explain why I am not like other men but I will put into words the incurable damage that has been inflicted on me in a court of law. Even if the glitch is fixed soon, there will be no compensation for the trauma I have had to endure. It is my legal right to be able to hide behind the cloak of anonymity on social media and Facebook can't even grant me that""

Meanwhile, panic rose across the internet as netizens were no longer able to stalk the profile of their exes as a part of their daily 3 AM depression routine.

""It was past midnight and time for me to regret my life choices and obsess over my past relationship despite all the trauma it inflicted upon me,"" Raisa explained how the glitch affected her, ""When I went to his profile to see whether he was miserable without me, the glitch automatically sent him a friend request. Being the desperate loner he is, he accepted the friend request in less than a second. Next thing you know, my emotionally needy self forgot about all the therapy sessions and got back together with him.""

Raisa has since broken up yet again with her partner and resides in a state of shock. While she wasn't exactly sure who to blame for her series of terrible decisions, Raisa has turned to the very functional legal framework that governs big tech companies. She hopes to emerge victorious.

""A girl can only lose so much,"" she said upon asking what was the rationale behind her drastic decision.

Their efforts might be futile but the silver lining to their wild goose chase is that the only people more reckless than Shadman and Raisa are billionaire tech entrepreneurs. So, the odds may not entirely be against them.

Facebook CEO Mark Lizardburg has come out and claimed that the glitch was intentional, ""With the Pranuv Train concert less than a month, it is pathetic how most of you don't even have a date. I decided to take matters into my own hands and be the matchmaker myself.""

""The real victims in this tragedy are the ones who didn't get any friend requests despite the glitch and me,"" said Mark.

477,Cutting trees to make way for air,"DSTC a step ahead of environmentalists

In a bid to help citizens during the ongoing heatwave, the Dhoka South Town Corporation has launched a tree-cutting drive across the southern parts of the capital.

Although experts and environmentalists have opposed the move for their nonsensical reasons based on fictitious science, the Dhoka South Mayor Faposh Dhur provided ironclad logic and reasons for the drive.

Speaking to this correspondent, the charming mayor said, ""See, the capital is like a jungle. Too many trees everywhere. They are occupying too much space and this is resulting in low amounts of air and wind. We need bigger spaces for air and wind to pass through, and cutting the trees will give us that space.""

About the ""beautification"" reason given by the authorities, he said, ""It's true. Who needs green everywhere? It's not even a pretty colour. Have you studied colour theory? Green is known to be the colour of jealousy. Are we a jealous city? No.

""The northern mayor probably likes ugly things. His side of the city will not be as beautiful as my side. They can rot in hell with their trees and lack of air and wind. The south shall rise again!""

""Let's just say, we are not only helping humanity, we are also making the city much prettier. I believe in the colours brown and grey, so the innumerable concrete buildings, the dirt, and dust are all contributing beautifully to our purpose. I also believe in diversity in colour, and if you want green, you can find shades of it in the drains, which are left open for your viewing pleasure.""

Meanwhile, protests have been going on across the city as environmentalists are claiming that the cutting of trees will have adverse impacts on the atmosphere.

Regarding that, Dhur said, ""Who are these 'environmentalists'? If they know so much, why couldn't they be mayor? They only know science and science is the least of our concerns. Do they have logic as strong as mine? They want the city to be cooler. How will it be cooler without the space for air and wind? And where will that space come from if there are so many trees surrounding us? Did they ever ask themselves these questions?""

Asked about the ""environmentalists"" comments that trees help keep the temperature down through providing shade and evapotranspiration, he further said, ""Hah! Evapotranspiration? You see what I mean about all this pseudo-science. These people just make up words. And anyway, what shade does a tree provide? So much light comes through the leaves. But when you make buildings, they provide so much better shade, and when you go inside, you get air conditioning – cooler air, meaning not global 'warming' but global 'cooling' inside your own flats!.""

Meanwhile, Dhoka North Town Corporation has decided to plant two lakh trees in areas under its jurisdiction, upon its mayor's directives. The reason given by the mayor was that he too was helping citizens tackle the heatwave.

About these vastly different approaches, Faposh said, ""The northern mayor probably likes ugly things. His side of the city will not be as beautiful as my side. They can rot in hell with their trees and lack of air and wind. The south shall rise again!""",2023-05-12 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/cutting-trees-make-way-air-3318351,2023-05-18 10:28:32,thedailystar
478,Growing number of locals nominate female family members for basic tasks,"Locals are being inspired by a city father's mother's decision to represent her ousted and disgraced son by nominating herself as an independent woman … erm … candidate.

The incident seems to have given rise to its own set of strange events that are oddly connected to one another. For example, just recently a mayor nominated his daughter to clean up his counterpart's dirty track record.

The power of an independent woman doesn't seem to be lost on anyone as more and more men continue to take advantage of this phenomenon.

To find out more about the matter, this correspondent spoke to some very tired, independent women about the perils of this freedom.

""I have a very feminist husband and he generally values my independence a lot. But these days, life is so hard owing to the heatwave and traffic, and I am also very tired from breaking the glass ceiling at work every day that I usually just return home and don't have the time to think about what to feed my children. My husband is the same too. So we tasked my mother to take on this task for me. Because these days, feminism means 'ghor o shamlai, kaaj o shamlai',"" says Nasima Chowdhury.

""I hate this man's world. My mother was better equipped to handle it because, you know, she had the power of tolerance because she had to learn where a woman's place was. So, I have decided to take my mother to work with me. With her around, no man comes and cracks jokes with me that I have to politely laugh at.""

479,Guardiola promises to cut his hair if City fail to beat Real in UCL semi,"Pep Guardiola, who is popularly known for bottling Champions League campaigns, is once again dreaming again of winning it, even at the cost of his hair.

A leaked audio of one of his confidential UCL-related conversations with Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been circulating on social media, and Guardiola was heard promising that he would cut his hair and go bald permanently if he, once again, failed to beat Real Madrid.

English media and their pundits have termed Madrid's triumph over Man City last year as ""a major shock"" despite Madrid being the club with the highest champions league titles. A major shock shocked Guardiola again as his team drew the first leg at the Santiago Bernabeu.

However, the 1-1 tie of the first leg has inspired Guardiola to be more ruthless against Madrid this Thursday at their home ground, Etihad, which is more famous for its emptiness and surreal quiescence than UCL wins. Guardiola has reportedly urged fans to be loud and proud of their team as they are going to smash Real Madrid, echoing Wayne Rooney's sentiment.

""I am begging you to fill the emptiness of Etihad and be the eye-witnesses of sublime glory. Your responsibility is to be chaotic and my responsibility is to beat Madrid. If I fail to do that, I promise, I will cut my hair completely and go bald permanently,"" Guardiola said in the secret message sent via the Zlatan conversation to Man City's easily-countable fans, which was obtained by a Satireday correspondent later.

On the contrary Real Madrid fans seemed relaxed ahead of their crucial away match in England.

When asked why they were so calm and confident about their victory in the second leg, set to kick off in England days later, Tausif, a die-hard Madrid fan from Basabo, said, ""Well, we don't consider it an away match. We will surely outnumber their fans in their own stadium, which eventually will make our players think that they are actually playing in our home ground.""

When asked why he was so sure about their domination, he said, ""Why wouldn't I be? I have more friends on my Facebook than there are Man City fans in their country.""

However, ever since Guardiola's promise went public, fans, borrowed from PSG and Barcelona, started to celebrate their potential victory over Madrid. While a group of mercenary fans was planning what they would do after Manchester City's victory over Inter Milan in the final, our Satireday correspondent intruded.

When asked what was more likely to happen -- Guardiola goes bald or Man City win their first Champions League title -- Zuabair, a mercenary fan from Barcelona, said, ""Bro, how can Madrid win against Man City, that too, after Guardiola's greatest ever threat?""

Another fan, Sakib, said both outcomes were equally likely and might not be mutually exclusive.

Satireday tried to contact Pep Guardiola about the validity of his viral comment, but he said ""No ingles"".",2023-05-12 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/guardiola-promises-cut-his-hair-if-city-fail-beat-real-ucl-semi-3318336,2023-05-18 10:28:35,thedailystar
480,The shoes that killed football,"The month of May, 2077.

The BFFE (Best Friends Forever and Ever) are holding a grand ceremony to celebrate 50 years of the successful eradication of any kind of football-related activities in the country.

For decades at the BFFE headquarters, informally known as Bluffufo, a celebration has been taking place this time of the year.

May marks the pivotal month when, 54 years prior, BFFE ensured that half the sports journalists could not cover football any longer. It stemmed from one classist ""inside joke"" from the then and the now president of the football board, Don Vito Salamanca.

This reporter -- who travelled through time as part of an inter-temporal investigation to find out what drove a board to declare war on the very sport they were assigned to steer to growth -- first learned upon arrival that no one could recall exactly when the term ""Bluffufo"" was coined.

Rumours had it that a certain leading spyware company of the 2020s hacked the BFFE website and replaced its name in an act of protest, saying Salamanca was hampering their business by leaking sensitive content himself.

In a tell-all interview back in 2027, the football boss said that he wanted to make football elite, because that is the only way standards would be raised.

The rumour refers back to when the BFFE chief was overheard demanding that sports journalists must carry a photo of their fathers wearing shoes to secure entry to the BFFE House.

It first drew ire from people from all walks of life, and some naive folks even thought that was to be the last straw for Salamanca but the reality was different.

The remaining half of the journalists, who had the required photos, faced further challenges as Salamanca demanded pictures with their fathers wearing ""branded shoes"", and DNA results showing Caucasian ancestry.

Once sports journalists were eliminated, Salamanca's elitist attitude did not spare the footballers as they too were subject to the demands, and by May 2027, had stopped playing the game altogether. The spectators were gone before any of this happened.

In a tell-all interview back in 2027, the football boss said that he wanted to make football elite, because that is the only way standards would be raised.

Fast forward to 2077, and it is impossible to find any sports reporter who once covered football or knew anyone who admitted to doing so.

Asked, a sports journalist who covers Crazeball -- a hybrid of cricket and baseball, the most popular game here -- said football is a taboo topic in this part of the world, mainly because it triggers PTSD in people.

During the 50-year-celebration, this reporter discovered a bizarre costume party going on, where BFFE officials were dressed in red and white -- reminiscent of the uniform worn by the East India Company.

Moreover, the hosts were seen sipping on this particular drink. It was learned that the so-called beverage, considered sacred at BFFE, was made by soaking the boots and socks of their beloved colonial masters for at least 12 years.

Football is not completely dead, though. A few BFFE officials, who requested several times that their names be mentioned, told this reporter that they have been taking the video game industry quite seriously for a while now and expected more funding from FIFA, EA Sports, PlayStation et al in future.

They also mentioned that spreading the FIFA game to the grassroots is their primary goal, following which everyone laughed hysterically and made a toast.

Soon Salamanca, still BFFE president somehow, tuned in via a hologram from an undisclosed location, somewhere in Europe.

Salamanca was accompanied by his personal lawyer and psychologist. He began his speech, saying, ""We must not let every Abul, Mokbul and Emily play the football video game; only the ones whose great-great grandparents had tickets, passports, etc. to show that they had travelled to England can play. It should be made mandatory, alright?""",2023-05-05 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/the-shoes-killed-football-3312216,2023-05-18 10:28:36,thedailystar
481,Farmers confused by helmet-wearing seasonal farmers,"Chapasthan has employed student leaders of universities and colleges, especially those who wear helmets regardless of whether they have bikes to boost agriculture.

Not only did their addition to the paddy fields during harvesting season change the profile of agriculture, it changed their social media profile pictures too.

Bhair Er Chotobhai, a first-year university student, recently added a new profile picture where he was seen standing with shears in hand right in the middle of a paddy field, with disturbed farmers in the corner of the frame.

When asked whether he abandoned his studies for farming, Bhai Er Chotobhai said, after taking his helmet off, ""No, not yet. We are just helping our helpless farmers. I doubt whether they could take their crops home if we didn't come forward to help them.""

Bhai Er Chotobon, another dedicated soul who prefers uttering slogans to studying, was caught reaping crops whimsically, apparently to draw the attention of the photographers as she stopped doing so as soon as the photographers left.

When asked what exactly brought her out underneath the scorching sun instead of studying in an air-conditioned room, Bhai Er Chotobon said, ""Well, no other work can be as great as helping our farmers!""

The leader of students, Aadu Bhai, whose age implies that he is more an uncle than a brother, has asked everyone not to be confused by the helmets of his soldiers.

But the farmers continue to be baffled by this practice. Anxiety grips them as their crops get smashed by the unwanted parade of helpers.

The leader of students, Aadu Bhai, whose age implies that he is more an uncle than a brother, has asked everyone not to be confused by the helmets of his soldiers.

""Look, we are witnessing the hottest summer of the last few decades. Our boys are using helmets while helping you in the paddy fields just to save them from the scorching sun. Neither they nor their helmets pose any threat, especially for farmers,"" Aadu Bhai said loudly in front of the crowd, of which 70 percent were media people, 20 percent local inhabitants and 10 percent farmers.

Farmers, on the other hand, remained disrupted as they couldn't accept ""the new farmers"" on their fields. They remained clueless about what exactly compelled these bikers to leave the roads and join farmers in the fields.

When asked how they were feeling as they didn't have to do the toil, Tausif, the lead farmer, said, ""Have you really been present here since morning? How will I fix my spoiled crops, smashed by the helpers? It actually doubles my work. We need more farmers, not bikers who act like farmers.""",2023-05-05 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/farmers-confused-helmet-wearing-seasonal-farmers-3312206,2023-05-18 10:28:37,thedailystar
482,Living in a loving society,"We are lucky to be growing up in a society so caring and loving.

Through a series of questions, this society shows its undying affection for all its members.

These very thoughtful questions are asked from the heart, with the need to make the person questioned feel important and loved (read: humiliated and traumatised).

One of the very first questions a Bangalee, anywhere in the world, will ask at the very first meeting is ""Desh er bari kothay (which district are you from)?""

This is an all-important question, because each district has a distinct set of characteristics irrevocably associated with the locals.

So, when they find out you are from Noakhali, whether they ever meet you again or not, they will know to keep dinner invitations short. If, say, you are from Barishal, in the two minutes that you spend with this caring Bangalee questioner, you will come off as someone with anger issues, and just a bad person overall.

If you are from Cumilla, you are supposedly selfish. If from Chattogram, you are all things terrifying.

With this particular information, it is easy for society to analyse and dissect your character to judge you better to know precisely how much and what kind of importance and love to give you.

Your ""desher bari"" dictates who and how you are -- regardless of your manners, your morals, or your charming smile.

The next question on the list, more often than not, is ""Matric/inter kon shale (When did you sit for SSC/HSC exams)?""

This is society's caring, tactful way of finding out your age.

However, questions following this one will include your grades, your future plans, your subject of interest and whether or not you are getting a Master's degree and a PhD.

Again, all these matters matter very much because without answers to these very crucial questions, one cannot find enough material with which to judge you, very lovingly of course.

Another thoughtful question parents face is ""Bachchar result ki (What is your child's exam results)?""

Because who doesn't love watching parents crumble in embarrassment if by any chance there is a child who did not get to flash the infamous V sign this year?

Whether they have passed the exams or not is the least of their concerns. They have to know the exact numbers, for how else can they compare your child with theirs and everyone else's?

Because society has taken it upon itself to make sure you know whether or not your child is stupid -- out of sheer love and concern.

But society reserves the most incisive inquisitions for when you enter adulthood.

While you are already conflicted regarding what you want to do in life, society never fails to remind you that you are always falling behind.

Behind what, no one knows. But your time is somehow ""running out"". Forever.

Any wedding you attend after the age of 18, you will be asked ""biye kobe korba (When will you get married)?""

Because how many suitors you have and which one you pick (or picks you) is all you have left to ""achieve"" after all those degrees they want you to have. And society just wants you to achieve, because it cares.

If, ""luckily"", you have someone you will be getting married to, men will face ""Meye ki forsha (Is the girl fair skinned)?""

Mind you, she cannot be foreign, lest you want to become an outcast, but she has to be fair like foreigners.

Meanwhile, the ladies hear ""Chhele koi chakri kore, salary koto (Where does the boy work, how much does he earn)?"" Because, if you are a woman, you cannot be the one making the money. You must be making the sandwich with the bread he buys with his money. And society must know if he can buy you that bread.

And if, by any small chance, you are already married and thinking, ""Hah! No more ridiculous, beyond-personal questions now!"" you will be slapped on the face with a ""Bachcha kobe niba (When will you have kids)?""

You have kids?

""Bachchar results ki?""",2023-05-05 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/living-loving-society-3312201,2023-05-18 10:28:39,thedailystar
483,Gas distributor does some gaslighting,"An official of the Largest Gas Distributor of Chapasthan (Lagadicha) assured subscribers that there was no reason to be concerned by the smell of gas that drove many of the capital's residents to spend a night stargazing instead of lying in the comfort of their own beds.

This exodus from homes happened on one of the nights following a festival that drove a lot of the capital's residents to their home districts for altogether happier reasons.

Those who remained had to deal with gas and the fear of sparks, rivalled only by the fear of earthquakes and well, fire, in the hearts of the Japanese. But they have wooden houses, experts say.

On that night a few days after the festival, residents said they were frightened by the smell of gas coming from their stoves, and so, fearing a fire or explosion they went out on the streets.

Bodbashpo Haider, chief gaslighting officer of Lagadicha, said the thousands of residents of the city were actually misguided. The smell, he said, had to do with another kind of leakage and a very different kind of gas.

It is our satirical policy to only allude to what he meant, without actually saying it. Here goes nothing…

""The thing is, there was increased pressure of gas of another kind,"" he told Satireday. ""You see, in the days leading up to the festival, people went without eating. Then on the day of the festival and the days following it, they had feasts.""

These feasts were rich, he said. Even for the poor, they must have been richer than normal, he mused.

""When there is so much sudden gas pressure, it is of course to be expected that some would leak,"" the chief gaslighter said. ""After all, not all distribution networks are as robust and continent as ours.""

Asked what in Lucifer's lair he was actually talking about, he said, ""Well, I am saying that people's bodies have limits, you know?

""And just to prove that the gas was not ours, people smelt it, which means they must have dealt it. This is because our gas is odourless.""

Our correspondent was shocked at this, because it was reported that odour was added to the gas to alert people in cases of leakage.

""Oh, if you believed that you are very prone to gaslighting. You can't get a job in my department,"" Bodbashpo said.

He went on, ""What I am saying is scientifically accurate. Those who left the city also went through the same thing -- they had feasts, felt the pressure, squeezed the cheese, opened their lunchbox. But since they were in open areas, they could not smell any leakages. In the city, where the wind breaks and people live in congested areas, you can smell it.""

But what about reports of distribution pipes being 50, 60 years old and needing repairs?

""Oh, pipes, is that what we are calling them? Well, I feel it is very ageist of you. Biden is the president of America at 80 and no one is pipeshaming him.

""Anyway, I better leave and you should too, I think a stove is on somewhere. I smell gas.""

Our correspondent did not smell the gas.

484,Satire writer shunned after 2- week gap in publication,"A writer for this page lost his girlfriend, was shunned by his family and lost his job, all because there was no publication of this page for two weeks.

This was not because people were missing the satire page, oh no, but because Rasel, the writer, was constantly spouting satire ideas even when people were being serious with him. It was learnt that this habit intensified on Tuesdays and Wednesdays as the Thursday deadline for submissions loomed.

He was supposed to send in an article this week, to be used in this space, but said he has exhausted all his ideas, and because of their repercussions, is taking an indefinite break from satire.

The publication of this page was halted for two weeks because of Pahela Baishakh and the Eid holidays the following weekend.

""I was just complaining to him about a friend of mine who kept showing her privilege on social media, and he looked at me and blurted out 'Privileged woman complaining about others' privileges',"" his girlfriend said. She also complained about many other such instances, including saying ""Woman gets distracted by shopping app while complaining of expenses"".

He has also alienated his family in similar fashion.

His sister had called to ask their mother where she had kept the achar in her own flat, before she was able to find it on her own, and Rasel overheard the conversation.

""I could hear Rasel laughing loudly in the background and saying '30-year-old married woman finally able to find her own nose without the help of her mother',"" said Rasel's sister. ""This set off a fight between all three of us, and now we are not on talking terms.""

Finally, he lost his job too.

After a meeting at his company, where all the bosses were present, had finally ended after one and a half hours, Rasel, who had reportedly stayed silent throughout, blurted out: ""Meetings are like Las Vegas: what happens here stays here… you guys get it? None of what is discussed here ever gets implemented! Hahaha…""

While we may not really miss him, we may be using some of his ideas in the coming weeks.",2023-04-28 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/satire-writer-shunned-after-2-week-gap-publication-3306926,2023-05-18 10:28:41,thedailystar
485,Heroes sparring over who had the better movie create local Avengers plot,"""Eid without our local heroes' fighting over their movies' supremacy is like sweet without sugar. You cannot enjoy the festival wholly if they don't fight,"" Tausif, a local movie freak from Basabo, said while sharing a movie meme in his timeline on Facebook.

""I feel suffocated and immense emptiness around me unless I see our heroes' war of words during Eid. It reminds me that I am still alive and kicking and the festive mood is knocking at the door,"" Nazmus Sakib, another movie fanatic, said.

Bangladesh, the land of hidden talents, holds the record of having the highest number of heroes per capita. People are blessed here to be able to discover different ""heroes from nowhere"" every day.

A humanitarian research organisation framed Bangladeshi people's life-cycle after conducting a very sophisticated research programme. Birth-complaining about traffic-discovering new heroes every day-death is the cycle made by a delicate computer program, based on data found after research.

This tussle of titans was a blessing in disguise as it led to talk of creating Avengers, a local, and probably low-cost, universe of Bangalee superheroes.

Heroes from all walks of life have shown their potential many times on television, YouTube, Facebook. People call it 'Avengers of Bengal' as these heroes tend to attack each other collectively or individually with their superpower, a verbal attack that penetrates hearts more severely than a break-up. The attack gets momentum whenever one hero has to bring hundreds of reasons why his movie is better than his counterpart's.

Satireday encountered some of these characters who are believed to be in leading positions in becoming the Avengers of Bengal. ""I am the number one hero of the country, and that means that my upcoming movie 'Litre' is already number one. No one other than me deserves to be the best Avenger Iron Man,"" Shaaksobji Khaan, a vegetarian actor said while looking for broiler chicken at Tk 250 per kg.

""My wife Forsha and I had to hold 20 business meetings to complete the shoots of my next movie 'Save Him'. Can you guess its appeal?"" Antoto Reel, country's self-proclaimed superhero who can do the impossible, indicated what he was coming up with.

""People say when Appi's movie gets released, time stops and the audiences become hypnotised. My next movie 'Foolish' will show how important an Avenger I could be,"" said Appi Bohudoorie, who believes himself to be more powerful than Thor, that too without a hammer.",2023-04-28 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/heroes-sparring-over-who-had-the-better-movie-create-local-avengers-plot-3306921,2023-05-18 10:28:42,thedailystar
486,Summer lover changes favourite season after air conditioner stops working,"""It was 40 degrees outside and everyone was complaining about the excruciatingly painful heat waves. But it felt like 18 degrees in my room so I had no idea what they were whining about,"" said Shadman, ""Sure, I had my air conditioner on for 10 hours at a stretch and I'm privileged enough to not have to worry about the electricity bill but that has nothing to do with my love for summer. Just when I was about to post on social media why summer is my favourite season and be the most hated person on the internet because I crave the idea of holding unique opinions to feel superior, my air conditioner stopped working. My worst nightmare was about to come to life – I was about to start sweating. Before a single drop of my sweat could touch the ground, I finally realised that summer wasn't my favourite season anymore.""

Shadman Sakib, runners-up of the reality TV show 'The Privileged' on NetFlex, recently realised that there is a world outside the air-conditioned room and car his father pays for, ""Previously, every time someone crammed in the local bus or rickshaw complained about the heat in the traffic jam, I just told them to turn the AC on. I'm the kind of person who'd celebrate how magical Dhaka is despite the constant abuse I've faced from the city. Stockholm Syndrome is legally my middle name. I'm the kind of guy who'd spend their entire day in an air-conditioned car, hang out in rich Gulshan cafes and call this abysmal chaotic mess 'Jaadur Shohor' without even acknowledging the existence of South Dhaka. So naturally, I find an attraction to everything that treats me harshly, such as my university, my father, or the summer season in Dhaka.""

""After my AC stopped working, I finally had the revelation that not everyone can afford to love the 40-degree Celsius environmental nightmare that is summer in Dhaka,"" continued Shadman, ""Liking summer in Dhaka is like saying you are a big fan of Artcell. It might sound interesting at first but 16 minutes into it, you realise you need to splash water on your face and get your life together.""

Meanwhile, commoners are reportedly launching a manhunt to find the summer sympathisers and bring them out to the UV radiation without sunscreens on. However, environmentalists are still hopeful about saving the planet. ""The dehydration is so strong that the mighty Aquaman is just 'man' now. This isn't even summer! It's just global warming at its peak. Bangladeshi weather is acting like my cup of tea in the morning, it's either burning hot or excruciatingly cold, with no in-between. How can global warming be someone's favourite season?"" asked environmentalist Greta Sunburnt.

""But it's not too late to fix the climate. We can start by planting more trees,"" said Ms Sunburnt, ""Unfortunately, when we asked the authorities to raise consciousness about tree plantation, they cut some trees, raised a billboard and put up a huge promotional banner about tree plantation on it.""

Meanwhile, the popular restaurant chain ""Six Seasons Restaurant"" is reportedly changing its name to ""Two Seasons"" since six seasons in Bangladesh is now a myth thanks to global warming.

487,Girlfriend breaks up with boyfriend because he’s obsessed with chikon jilapi,"""It started with him prioritising chikon jilapi over the mota ones,"" said Raisa talking about her breakup, ""But unlike half of my countrymen, I'm aware that people can hold opinions different than mine and can survive without making a mess out of it. So, I simply let it go. But soon, his fascination turned into an obsession. The man who'd whine about standing in line at a clothing store for 10 minutes was suddenly as patient as a girl discussing lehenga measurements with her tailor. Whenever I'd call him, he'd either be waiting in a line for chikon jilapi or getting out of one.""

Chikon jilapi has ruined more than just Raisa's relationship. Raisa's boyfriend Shadman spent all his savings on chikon jilapi this Ramadan, ""Whenever he'd see a Facebook post of some restaurant selling chikon jilapi at a ridiculous price, he'd go and buy it out of sheer obsession. They literally sprinkled chocolate wrappers on top of the jilapi and called it golden jilapi, and Shadman was naive enough to break his savings account to spend it all on one kg of jilapi. Worst of all, he didn't even make a food vlog out of it. I mean, what's even the point then?""

Shadman's obsession reached the point that he started taking money from his family and even Raisa to fulfil his cravings.

""He took money from me in the name of buying panjabis and bought jilapis with it instead. I forcibly took him from the jilapi line one evening and bought him an expensive Illeen DeGeneres Panjabi. But he sold it to someone else the next day and bought chikon jilapi with that money. Things even ended up in violence when one of my friends called it ""jalebi"" in front of Shadman, which I don't honestly blame him for.""

""I informed his family members and together we tried to put an end to this obsession,"" added Raisa, ""We banished him from going to local sweet shops or hanging out with friends he eats jilapi with. But the local sellers won't stop luring him and I caught him red-handed taking chikon jilapi from his dealer right in front of his house!""

Shadman had so much sugar content in his blood that the mosquitoes in his room were scared of biting him thinking they might get diabetes from sucking his blood. When we reached out to one of the mosquitoes, it said, ""Jzz Jzz Jzz"". We don't particularly know what it meant but it sounded really angry.

""All our conversations were about chikon jilapi and all our dates were at local jilapi shops,"" cried Raisa, ""I even tried to get him into normal jilapis for a change but being the Bengali man he is, he just fat-shamed the jilapi on social media and laughed about it. But I wasn't prepared to let him go just yet. I loved him and was willing to sacrifice everything to bring him on the right track. That was until he said that he loved bangi and preferred it over all other fruits. That's when I realised, I couldn't build my future with this person and dumped him.""

488,"Man stays in Bangladesh despite apparently acing IELTS, goes viral","It is a given that someone who secures a commendable score in the IELTS exam will go abroad, and not stay back in Bangladesh.

But this simple truth was proved untrue in broad daylight by a middle-aged man as he was spotted effortlessly speaking with a foreigner in English, which he must have learned while preparing for the IELTS, an English language test believed to be designed especially for Sylheti inhabitants.

The man first came to light in a video where he was seen trying his heart and soul to help a foreign YouTuber in the alleys of Kawran Bazar.

Bangladesh is a coveted destination for YouTubers, as much for the country's natural beauty as its 170 million potential subscribers.

The long course of the IELTS ace's assistance to the foreigner started from the roundabout of Kawran Bazar and continued till the Hatirjheel signal. The journey included the greatest ""English to Bangla Translation"" show, where our man translated ""keep the change"" to ""bakita amare dite koiche"". As the IELTS test doesn't have a translation section, people did not bother about his E2B skills.

The long course of the IELTS ace's assistance to the foreigner started from the roundabout of Kawran Bazar and continued till the Hatirjheel signal.

While the foreigner was passing by the BFDC, the headquarters of the Shilpi Samiti where two groups of alleged actors always fight for the most desired chair, the IELTS graduate pleaded with him for some dollars as he was severely disturbed by the incessant devaluation of the local currency.

This Satireday correspondent, in disguise, closely observed the events from a distance and went to the man, who was utterly disappointed after successfully being denied by the foreigner several times.

When asked why he was asking for money from an obscure tourist, he said, ""You saw that? We were actually having a conversation as I was testing my English-speaking knowledge. Asking for some money was just an exercise.""

As his second interview with this correspondent also went viral, people were desperate to know why such an awesome speaker had not applied to go to the USA, Canada or some European countries yet, despite apparently having a good IELTS score.

Although the man never disclosed his IELTS score or whether he really sat for the exam, people believed that it was not possible that such a fluent speaker would rule out the idea of sitting for the IELTS exam and obtaining a handsome score.

So, the only concern of people, who watched his video on social media, was why he didn't yet join the leaving-the-country brigade.

""If I were him, I would be in a room in Canada now, looking at the snowfall through my window,"" Tausif, a Canadian visa-seeker, said in despair.

Like the video, disappointment also went viral as we talked to another person. When asked what he thought about the man and his English-speaking calibre, Nazmus Sakib, another seeker of visa to a country dominated by fair-skinned people, said, ""Such a treasure should not be wasted in the city of traffic jams. He should be somewhere in the world where snowfall and school shootings occur simultaneously.""",2023-04-07 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/man-stays-bangladesh-despite-apparently-acing-ielts-goes-viral-3291696,2023-05-18 10:28:46,thedailystar
489,People get angrier as iftar approaches: study,"People get more and more frustrated and angry at each other as the time to break fast in the holy month of Ramadan approaches, a new study found.

The study conducted by a group called ""Blatantly Obvious Conclusions"" also found that people were more likely to engage in physical violence near the time of sunset than earlier in the day.

The findings of the study were revealed in a press conference in the capital yesterday.

""We have spoken to a large cross-section of people, including office workers, pedestrians, motorists and homemakers,"" said Abul Kabul, the lead author.

""The conclusions are unmistakable, and obvious, obviously. People in Dhaka get angrier as the day wears on,"" he said at the press conference that started around evening yesterday.

Among the signs of tempers flaring were a greater incidence of honking on the streets, slapping rickshaw-pullers, rickshaw-puller-on-rickshaw-puller violence, arguments among married couples, and long tailbacks caused by a motorist abusing the ancestors of another in the middle of the road.

""We think this may be linked to hunger pangs and people experiencing withdrawal due to not being able to indulge their vices while fasting,"" Abul said. ""It is of course not helped by the traffic, the air pollution, and the heat people often experience at the end of the work day.""

A reporter asked for the study duration, and the study authors on stage started rifling through the study documents for around five minutes.

""Er… it seems that we do not have the exact dates,"" Abul said. ""Let's just say that this study was conducted over the last three years.""

""Over the last three Ramadans, you mean?"" a reporter asked.

""No, this was over all of the last three years.""

""So this isn't restricted to people getting angrier as iftar approaches. People in Dhaka generally get angrier as the day wears on, regardless of time of year?""

Abul paused for a second, before replying, ""Oh will you look at that? Living in Dhaka basically gets you angry. Fascinating! Blatantly Obvious Conclusions will publish another study on this. Now, please enjoy your iftar.""

In other news, a study found that there were too many studies being published and reported on, and that many may be misleading.",2023-04-07 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/people-get-angrier-iftar-approaches-study-3291691,2023-05-18 10:28:47,thedailystar
490,Company blacking out windows to stop workers leaving at the sight of empty roads,"A company in Dhaka has started blacking out its windows to increase productivity in the month of Ramadan.

This came to light after the glass front of the building, which houses the company, was seen being painted black yesterday.

The building is located on one of the busiest thoroughfares in the capital.

This correspondent visited the company yesterday and talked to employees and management to find the reason for this unusual action.

At the request of management and ignoring the pleas of employees, Satireday has decided not to name the company.

""Everything was going fine at the start of Ramadan,"" said a top official. ""For the first few days, it was business as usual -- us telling employees they should work harder, longer, faster and them constantly failing … you know the drill, right?"" asked a top official of the company.

""But one day, about a week into Ramadan, around 2:00pm we [other top officials] heard what I can only call crazed laughter from the floor where everyone else works.""

The top official said that upon going down to the floor, he saw one of the employees laughing maniacally as he gathered his stuff and without explanation ran full pelt towards the exit.

""He [the employee] apparently looked out the window and saw that the streets were mostly empty, with just one or two vehicles on the road,"" the senior member of management said.

He then shouted ""IFTAAAR!!!"" and ran out the door.

Speaking to the employees, this correspondent learnt that over the following days, others followed the footsteps of the ""trailblazer"", as they called the original bolter.

""It takes us two hours to get home for iftar. It doesn't matter where home is or what mode of transport we choose to take, it takes two hours. So, that means we miss iftar at home every day,"" an employee said, adding that every day between 1:00pm and 2:00pm there was a lull in traffic.

""So, when we go stand by the window to look at the world outside, and see that the road is empty, how can we not drop whatever work there is and head out the door?"" the employee asked.

This correspondent talked to another top official and asked him whether blackening windows would do the trick, as the employees already know that the roads are relatively free during a particular hour.

""Oh, we are taking care of that too. We are piping in sounds of traffic into the general workspace, so that they think there is terrible congestion outside.

""It has to be done, otherwise productivity will fall and before you know it, management won't be able to order in the lavish iftars.""",2023-04-07 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/company-blacking-out-windows-stop-workers-leaving-the-sight-empty-roads-3291686,2023-05-18 10:28:48,thedailystar
491,Social media superheroes saving us with toxic comments,"Comments sections these days are like a virtual jungle gym for bullies, and it seems like everyone's monkeying around.

Who let these keyboard attackers out of their dungeons, and why are we subjecting ourselves to their wicked ways? Why do we keep diving into the shark tank of negativity that is the comments section, or worse, getting into a virtual slap fight with a total stranger?

Well, calling all netizens! Beware of the swarm of comment crusaders taking over your social media feeds.

Here's what you need to know about people who think they are mighty defenders of honour and culture, but are actually more like the Justice League of wicked teasers -- a group of nerds with delusions of grandeur.

Beware of the swarm of comment crusaders taking over your social media feeds. Here's what you need to know about people who think they are mighty defenders of honour and culture, but are actually more like the Justice League of wicked teasers -- a group of nerds with delusions of grandeur.

The Negativity Avenger

Beware of these comment ninjas who strike from the shadows and attack without provocation. They're like a pack of wild wolves, tearing apart any unsuspecting post that crosses their path. These ruthless keyboard attackers must have skipped their iodine supplements as kids, because they're definitely lacking some essential brain fuel.

It's like they're all suffering from a serious case of online hunger -- except they aren't hungry for food, but instead they're hungry for attention.

You can spot these comment crusaders by their signature phrases, like ""what a shame"", ""ruining our tradition"" and so on. It's like they've got a script for spreading negativity, and they're sticking to it like their lives depend on it. They're on a mission to suck all the joy out of the internet, one comment at a time.

The Flasher

If you know the superhero flash, you know how super-fast he is; Flash is so fast, he could finish all his errands before you finish reading this sentence.

Unlike the ""flash"" beware of ""Flasher"" commenters on Facebook! They're the creeps who post inappropriate photos under random people's statuses. Not only is their behaviour illegal and offensive, but it can also scar you for life! So, always double-check the profiles of those friend requests or they might end up speeding their way into your DM.

The Irony Man

Irony Man is a social media vigilante who wields their power of ironic wit like a weapon. They're always on the lookout for an opportunity to pounce on a post, comment or status update and turn it into a battlefield of snarky comments and biting sarcasm.

They think they're making the world a better place with their clever quips, but in reality, they're just a big old meanie. So, beware of this hero, social media users, because their powers of wit and insults can cause unnecessary drama and hurt feelings.

The Art-snob Ivy

Unlikethe infamous Poison Ivy,the Art-snob ivy fancies herself as the saviour of art and culture on social media. She's not shy about sharing her irrelevant opinions on aesthetics. Her poisonous comments seep into every conversation like a vine. Even a simple pet photo won't escape her venomous critiques. She'll go on and on about art and culture like she's writing a thesis. Beware her toxic presence and don't let her ruin your social media garden.

In the wise words of Taylor Swift, ""haters gonna hate"". But that doesn't mean we have to give them the time of day. Let's not let these comment crusaders and their negative vibes rain on our social media parade.

After all, life is too short to waste on virtual drama with actual strangers.

So, let's take a cue from the Justice League and use our powers for good. Let's spread positivity and kindness, and shut down these keyboard bullies like the superheroes we are. And if all else fails, we can always hit the unfollow button and keep it moving like a boss. Remember, in the grand scheme of things, these commenters are just small potatoes in our big bowl of social media soup. So, let's not let them ruin our appetite for connection and community. Stay classy, my fellow netizens, and keep on scrolling.

493,What to do if you like Nahubo,"There have been few songs in the history of this country that united as many people as Coke Studio Bangla's Nahubo has.

People on social media have been united in their hatred for the song. Complaints ranged from having to read three sets of subtitles, to the song just not being good. There has also been outrage that a channel calling itself Bangla are not featuring enough songs in the language.

But what if you actually liked the song? How are you going to show your face in public, or argue its case.

The following are a few tips:

GO FOR HIGHER STUDIES

To keep up with, or even have a hope of winning, arguments about the song on social media, you need higher education. Make sure you study hard and get enrolled in one of the leading private universities in Dhoka. This is not an ad but we suggest you go to Private University Pvt limited which will soon build a campus of their own, according to an article published on Shout.

""My husband is a corporate sellout, so he always listens to songs released by this capitalist venture without expending any thought to how the artists are being treated. I want nothing to do with this as I am a left-leaning activist. As such I have invested in the latest Universe S earbuds for him,"" says Naseka Sohan, a working woman.

MAKE SURE YOUR PARTNER IS GENEROUS

""My husband is a corporate sellout, so he always listens to songs released by this capitalist venture without expending any thought to how the artists are being treated. I want nothing to do with this as I am a left-leaning activist. As such I have invested in the latest Universe S earbuds for him,"" says Naseka Sohan, a working woman.

Naseka's advice maybe suitable for many couples to ensure they do not have to participate in their partner's musical choices.

FIND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN NASEK NASEK AND NAHUBO

Nasek Nasek, the first song by Coke Studio Bangla, was an immense hit. It was also sung by Animes Roy, the same guy who sung Nahubo. That was also a rock song. So, if you find enough similarities between the two songs, you can point out to people poo-pooing on Nahubo that they were not being inclusive and were jealous that a non-Bangla speaking person was the first artist to be feature twice on Coke Studio Bangla.

PLAY THE MISOGYNY CARD

Remind every critic that Daughter of Coastal is a woman and they were unable to take the fact that a woman could perform rap, a music form considered a masculine one. Call them misogynists.

FORGET ABOUT IT

Or, you can just remember that it is supposed to be subjective and forget the whole thing. There will be another song soon.",2023-03-24 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/what-do-if-you-nahubo-3279916,2023-05-18 10:28:52,thedailystar
494,Not such a good boy after all,"Police dog that ‘discovered’ bodies took another dog’s credit

What this correspondent is about to break to you is a story of betrayal, heartbreak and of course, utter and complete disappointment.

Last week, Puma, the goodest boy on the force, found six bodies from the rubble of an unnatural disaster. Everyone was quite proud of Puma, especially since the sheer amount of debris would've made any dog miss out on the bodies.

However, Puma, being as exceptional as he is, sniffed them out.

Everyone was overjoyed. Puma received more pats on the head than he ever did before. The treats kept on coming. And if that wasn't enough reward for our good boy, Puma also received the ""Police Chief's Medal"" (the highest honour among police), which was previously only awarded to human cops. He was the envy of all the dogs on the force.

""Everybody thought that I was just jealous when I barked out the truth. A week ago, the lieutenant called me to his room and said that I'm off the leash. That I have been a bad boy,"" whimpered Lattu.

The police chief said, ""Well I had no doubt that Puma would be the one to retrieve the bodies. Ever since he was a pup, he was so sharp. We used to call him 'The Hound' for the kind of nose that he has on him. He could always tell from afar if a cop hadn't washed his hands after going number 1. From then on, we knew he had serious talent.""

However, upon in-depth investigation, this correspondent found that Puma stole credit from another dog on the force, Lattu, who was the real good boy that sniffed out the bodies.

This correspondent met with Lattu on Wednesday, who was found chasing his own tail at an alley near the Police Academy building. He seemed quite anxious.

When this correspondent asked why Lattu was loitering in the alley, he replied ""woof, ruff, woof woof, ruff ruff, whoof"", which loosely translated to, ""They burned me man. I found those bodies and they burned me. Puma isn't the good boy you think he is.""

Asked to elaborate, Lattu said, ""Puma went east while I covered the west front. After around seven minutes or so, I found the bodies. I kept calling out to my lieutenant, barking. Minutes later, Puma comes running. He shoved my paw off the body and scowled. And that's exactly when everyone came in and lo and behold, Puma saved the day.

""Everybody thought that I was just jealous when I barked out the truth. A week ago, the lieutenant called me to his room and said that I'm off the leash. That I have been a bad boy,"" whimpered Lattu.

This correspondent would've asked more questions but before she could, Lattu got distracted and started barking at a homeless man.

Upon meeting Puma, this correspondent understood his allure. Meeting this correspondent, Puma started wagging his tail and stuck his tongue out. This correspondent almost got distracted by his charms and found herself compromising her journalistic integrity by patting Puma. He was good, a little too good.

However, after a game of fetch, Puma blurted out the truth.

""Look, Lattu wasn't ever going to make it. He was a dog adopted from a corner shop. I, on the other hand, am a premium breed. The police chief's daughter picked me out herself.

""Dogs like Lattu just don't figure out the game as well as dogs like me do, that's all. He just needed to work harder. But it seems nobody wants to work these days. Lattu was just barking up the wrong tree I suppose,"" added Puma.",2023-03-24 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/not-such-good-boy-after-all-3279921,2023-05-18 10:28:54,thedailystar
495,Juniors massaged student leader’s legs because he was preparing for the Olympics,"The country erupted in joy at news that a student leader from Bangladesh Mountains University is going to partake in running events of the Paris Olympics next year.

There was joy because for so long the country was unable to send a worthy opponent to the Games, but this youth -- whose preparation for the event has started more than a year in advance -- emerged with the message that the records of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah could be in danger.

This student leader was too down-to-earth to let the country know about his breathtaking preparation. Instead, a photographer had to capture this scrumptious moment very secretly while the leader was receiving a leg massage from juniors in a room isolated from the rest of the world.

As the photo went viral, people didn't take much time to react.

""I have been dreaming about representing my country in the Olympics as a sprinter since my childhood, a stage of age I passed 40 years ago. These junior students of my dormitory, I mean our dormitory, did not let me take care of my legs all by myself.""

Some believed that this latent talent should get some government aid as he was going to represent our country in the world's biggest sporting event, while others thought that this wannabe Mo Farah should get global, if not then at least South Asian, attention.

The scene that an unknown photographer captured had artistic value -- the man was watching amateur TikTok videos wearing a barely mentionable piece of clothing while his juniors, young enough to be his sons if he had gotten married when he entered the university as a fresher, was taking care of his precious legs.

Empty packets of medicine in his room indicated what he had to go through to get ready to represent his motherland on the global stage.

""I have been dreaming about representing my country in the Olympics as a sprinter since my childhood, a stage of age I passed 40 years ago. These junior students of my dormitory, I mean our dormitory, did not let me take care of my legs all by myself. If I ever win a gold medal in Olympics, half will go to these juniors, I promise,"" Burel, the young leader and Olympic aspirant, said.

When asked why they were taking care of their senior with such devotion, the juniors said, ""First of all, we want to say 'Sohomot Bhai' as we agree with what our leader said previously. Secondly, our Bhai is of our fathers' age. So, we took care of him with great honour. Thirdly, he is going to represent our country in the Olympics. So why wouldn't we take such good care of him?""

Controversy, however, is always around the corner in Bangladesh. Depsite being part of a heroic step in, the student leader had to face a lot of criticism, which he clearly didn't deserve, according to him.

People allegedly blamed him for getting a body massage free of cost. Some even said such a half-nude photo of him circulating on social media could degrade the morals of the youth. Some even went so far as to say that he was forcing his juniors to massage his legs.

As Satireday believes that the pursuit of knowledge is not bound by the pursuer's age, we asked this elderly youth if the last allegation was true.

Burel raged, ""I cannot believe I am going to make these stupid people proud one day. How could you say something like that about me? Ask these boys. If they say that I used them to massage my body, I will leave this dormitory.""

When reminded that he had already crossed his residential permission a decade ago, he said, ""That's another lie about me. If education knows no age, how could a student lose his studentship? If I don't lose my studentship, why should I leave dormitory?""",2023-03-24 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/juniors-massaged-student-leaders-legs-because-he-was-preparing-the-olympics-3279931,2023-05-18 10:28:55,thedailystar
496,University promises permanent campus in 2 years for 10 years in a row,"After the VC of Private University Pvt. Ltd. promised a new campus in his speech last week, the cheer from the crowd was less intense than expected as students are reportedly tired of hearing the same thing for the 10th year in a row. Some are even comparing the VC to politicians in Bangladesh owing to the number of false promises he's made in the past ten years.

The students of Private University Pvt. Ltd. have been demanding a permanent campus for years now on account of the ridicule they have to face from other universities. ""Starting from the authority's intense hunger for money to being overcrowded by English Medium students, we've got everything a typical Bangladeshi private university needs. Everything except for a proper campus that isn't a poorly ventilated building,"" said Shadman Sakib, a student of Private University Pvt. Ltd. ""But the lack of a permanent campus has made us a joke. We lose every rap battle with Bidirectional University because they've got the 'permanent campus' card with them.""

""You can't just put thousands of us in a rented out dimly lit building and call it a university,"" Shadman cried out loud as every other private university in the capital gasped in shock at his rant, ""Sure, we might be shamed as poultry farm chickens by our batchmates from other universities but that doesn't mean you put us in an actual poultry farm! When we aren't busy gasping for air or getting bullied on the internet, we have to wander around the streets of Dhaka like homeless people. We look so homeless in the streets during our off-period that the classist snobs won't let us in their expensive cafes.""

""Naturally, we all got super excited when our VC announced the construction of a brand-new permanent campus,"" continued Shadman, ""We've heard all sorts of myths regarding the new campus. They're saying that it's going to have proper air circulation, and sunlight and believe it or not, it's apparently going to have actual open spaces where the sky is visible! It's something no Private University Pvt. Ltd. alumnus has ever seen before. We were hopeful at first but after so many years, we've given up on our dreams. Not just Padma Bridge or the metro rail, even the road outside my house is finally complete! When the City Corporation beats you to the completion of a construction, you should realise that you're doing something wrong.""

However, Dr Jordan Jailfort, the VC of Private University Pvt. Ltd., remains hopeful, ""We've been able to lure more students into paying us ridiculous sums of money in exchange for certificates than ever by enticing them with the promise of a permanent campus. Once the project is complete, we'll have nothing else to entice them with! Our permanent campus is like the pursuit of happiness in life. The journey itself is the reward, not the destination.""

Meanwhile, the Guineas Book of World Records is reportedly going to award the university with a ""Stalling students for longest period of time"" certificate. The previous record was held by the boys' hostel at Shahbagh University as they took 9 years to fix a broken sink.

497,Content creator rules her own universe of 5,"A content creator recently declared that she had made her own social media universe where everything revolves around the number 5.

The story began with the creation of a Facebook page in just 5 minutes and the appointment of 5 moderators, but little did she know that 5 minutes of hard work would eventually pay off in less than 5 years.

She sat for the HSC exams and the fairytale continued when she secured golden GPA-5, a most desired result-sheet allegedly made of 5 carats of gold.

Her friends insisted that she have a grand party in a 5-star hotel. At that stage of the story, she was still unaware of her own universe.

The medical admission test approached and she released a video just 5 days before the exam day, showing people how she was so calm before the storm.

She sat for admission test and waited for the result as if neither she nor we knew what score was coming! Yes, it was 5 again and she eventually understood the mysterious universe she has been living in.

After her stellar result came to light, those who used to troll her became fans overnight and considered her the ""Iron-woman"" who created her own universe all by herself. One of the fans, refusing to opine in English, said in Bangla, ""Aapu amader onuprerona.""

""I would get panicked on nights before exams until I saw her video where she danced with visible peace on her face despite heading to one of the biggest exams of her life in just 5 days,"" Tausif, arguably the biggest fan of this content creator, said.

Our Satireday correspondent found after hectic research that her content helped people remain serene even if when they were under tremendous pressure. Her content gave people the ability to make videos for social media, regardless of whether they were going to an exam hall or shopping mall.

Finally, our correspondent tried to contact the content creator. After the first four calls were unanswered, she picked up on the fifth try. When asked if she had long been aware of the unusual activities in her universe, she said, ""No, I was totally unaware of the matter until I scored 5 despite studying 5 minutes daily. Later, I understood that if my five mintues could earn me 5 marks, I could have easily scored 100, had I studied 100 minutes a day.""

When asked if it was possible to study 100 minutes a day in the universe of 5, she said, ""Yeah, you just need to sit to study twenty times a day.""

""Hey guys, I am just going to hit the 5 lakh milestone soon. Help me reach that milestone. It will not take more than 5 seconds to find my page and hit the like button,"" she said when asked for a message to her fans.",2023-03-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/content-creator-rules-her-own-universe-5-3274051,2023-05-18 10:28:57,thedailystar

The city corporation has started a noble initiative to improve the fitness and wherewithal of the city dwellers. ""Mission Parkour!"" will encourage residents to jump over central reservations, dodge buses, trucks, rickshaws, private cars, CNG-run auto-rickshaws and other pedestrians as they go about their daily business in the city. CC officials said that to achieve this aim, pavements are being dug up and sewers opened up to dissuade pedestrians from walking on ""designated"" areas. This will ensure that pedestrians are walking among the vehicular traffic and that will in turn make them fitter as they have to perform acrobatics to survive. Their heart health will also improve as they will learn to cope with the shock of almost being killed (if they are lucky) on a daily basis.",2023-03-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/parkour-3274056,2023-05-18 10:28:59,thedailystar
499,Team can only win if board officials are shown on TV during matches: study,"Chapasthan's national cricket team has recently gone on an unexpected winning streak, romping to victory in matches against opposition no one expected them to beat.

Experts, pundits, ex-cricketers, and teastall and armchair experts have been trying to unearth the reason behind this run of success. People have been pointing to factors ranging from a change in coach to injection of youth that has allowed them to play a more fearless brand of cricket.

Days of speculation ended when a group of researchers released a study yesterday, and the results were not really shocking.

The study by Bombshell Brothers, the research group that insists that each of their published study be referred to by the adjective ""bombshell"", found that unlike anywhere else in the world, the cameras in Chapasthan are always focused on the cricket board officials during home matches.

""If you notice, when matches are being played in England, India or Sri Lanka … basically anywhere else in the world, the cameras focus on the crowds when they pan away from the action on the field,"" said Abul Babul, the lead researcher.

""If you notice, when matches are being played in England, India or Sri Lanka … basically anywhere else in the world, the cameras focus on the crowds when they pan away from the action on the field,"" said Abul Babul

""But in Chapasthan, it has been the practice to focus on the board officials in the VIP box and not the passionate supporters. While this has always been the case, recently the prevalence has increased by 258 percent, and cameramen have been focusing especially on the board president, Kamrul Hasan Phapa.

""We believe this is the reason for the recent uptick in results,"" said the research by Bombshell Brothers, which is funded by Board, Cricket Board (B,CB).

When asked for the reason behind this, Abul said it was obvious. ""In other countries, it is the passion of the fans that bring success. Players are eager to impress the fans so that they can get popular and net lucrative sponsorships.

""But in Chapasthan, the fans will support them no matter how badly the team plays. Here, the players really want to impress the board members, especially B,CB President Phapa. So, he has asked the camera operators to always focus on him, whether or not the team are doing well. And it has worked.""

A player, requesting anonymity, said whenever they see Phapa on the big screen, they get scared straight.

""If we are doing poorly, or if someone has dropped a catch, Phapa enormous face on the enormous screen scares the player half to death. It makes a big difference to know that he is watching.""

In related news, sales of masks bearing Phapa's images have gone through the roof in the leadup to the next round of matches, as fans are eager to fulfil their dream of being shown on live TV.

500,Scientists have discovered a new parasite and it could be your lab project partner,"After years of debate in the scientific community, parasitologists have finally discovered the most vicious parasite in the animal kingdom.

When engineering student Shadman's lab project partner bailed on him for two months straight only for him to re-appear on the day of the presentation and feast on Shadman's hard work, Shadman Sakib feared that he might have a parasite in his lab group. His fear came true after he reported his project partner Rafsan Plasmodium to Parasite Detection Agency (PDA) laboratories and the researchers confirmed his suspicion.

""Just like 4G internet, when you need it the most, Rafsan disappeared right after the lab project had been announced,"" Shadman spoke of his experience with the parasite. ""We had five members in our group. Two of them had no clue what the lab was about in the first place and I'm pretty sure the other one isn't even a student of this university. However, all of them were present in the project meetings except Rafsan. I called him so many times in the last two months that my telecom operator's customer care called me and told me to give up on him.""

Shadman even put up missing person posters in search of their project partner.

""We filed a GD in the police station and launched a campus-wide manhunt. Much like my self-confidence after one semester, Rafsan had just disappeared into thin air,"" he said. ""Just when we were about to give up on him, he appeared on the day of the presentation. The rest of us were exhausted after spending sleepless nights behind the project and kept reciting Ayat Al-Kursi the entire time, hoping that our project doesn't crash at the last moment.""

""However, Rafsan, with his 100 percent silk suit and 0 percent idea about the project, seemed ever so calm like he had everything under control. For the sake of our collective grades, we had to make sure the teachers didn't find out about the parasite among us. I had to shove my one month's worth of knowledge into Rafsan's head within five minutes. Like a parasite sucking on its host, Rafsan Plasmodium feasted on our intellect, our sleepless nights and our peace of mind, and managed to get the same marks as the rest of us in the presentation,"" continued Sadman.

Despite the injustice, Shadman remained patient.

""Sure, I wanted to inflict inexplicable pain upon Rafsan but who, in university, doesn't want to do so to their project partners? I was going to let him go. But then I saw him pose in front of our project module and take pictures for social media points. That's when I lost it. Zero contribution, parasitical behaviour, ruining my mental peace – that's all fine. But clawing for social media points is where I draw the line. I reported him to PDA the next day. I pray and hope that no other lab group has to fall victim to the parasite that is Rafsan Plasmodium.""

Meanwhile, scientists are fearing that there might be other parasites out there who are more vicious and dangerous than Rafsan Plasmodium,

""It's not just lab projects in universities. Humanoid parasites are all around us. Heck, our women are even willing to marry and spend their entire lives with some of them!""

501,Is there really a demand for cats and dogs in restaurants?,"Probe body finds rumours have driven canines and felines to seek asylum in EU

A host of cats and dogs in the capital have recently sought asylum in Europe because of a rumour that has spread like wildfire.

A probe committee headed by this Satireday correspondent found that canines and felines applied for shelter after they found out from social media that their popularity was increasing not only among pet-lovers but also in the country's restaurants.

The probe also found that news of the growing demand stemmed from the Facebook post made by one angry individual who was subjected to an unsatisfactory meal after ordering in from a restaurant.

According to the post, there was also an unsavoury interaction with the restaurant's management.

The post has since been deleted, but whether or not the rumour of cats and dogs being fed to customers is true, a group on social media, ""Khashir haar mota hoy"", has gone viral and so the popular notion among netizens is that dogs and cats are in high demand at restaurants.

A Europe-based correspondent who works for animal rights said countries in Europe received approximately one million applications from Bangladesh last month.

Around 99 percent of those applications were dogs and cats seeking asylum because their safety was ""under severe threat"" as their demand in restaurants was growing by leaps and bounds, they said.

This ""growing demand"" has also resulted in a large number of jobless youth making the best of the opportunity. They are picking up cats and dogs from the streets and selling them off to restaurants at competitive prices.

After passing a sleepless night because the girl he had a crush on did not reply to his message even after it was ""seen"", this correspondent caught up with a few people who were kidnapping sleeping dogs and shouting ""arekta khashi paichi"".

This correspondent, heart still broken, caught up with one of the dognappers and asked whether it was true that restaurants were actually using cats and dogs. ""Yes, of course it's true, don't you have social media? Do you think the words that show up on our phones, on apps, do you think those words are not true? They are not scribbled on paper. They are official, typed words,"" said the man, and went off with a dog.

A cat, while coming back from a neighbouring house after partying the whole night in the kitchen, was also caught by a group.

However, some dogs and cats were lucky and somehow managed a narrow escape. They called a press conference and asked the journalists to be present with a voice translator. Douglas, the leader of the Association of Dogs and Cats Rights Protection, said, ""Our identity is in real crisis. We have been being called ""castrated goats"" and then we are disappeared. I lost a few neighbours.

They were barking at Bhooter Goli area and some people kidnapped them in a white microbus. Is there any single reason to live in this country?""",2023-03-10 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/satireday/news/there-really-demand-cats-and-dogs-restaurants-3268091,2023-05-18 10:29:03,thedailystar
502,Hiking through an ‘alien’ world,"""Hey, what's the most beautiful place you've ever been to?""

This frequently asked question always baffles me. From the emerald-green waters of Amiakhum-Velakhum in Bandarban or the frozen lakes of Kinnaur Himalayas to the barren deserts of Death Valley or the stunning mountain roads of Nevada, hundreds of pictures start to flood my mind. All these places have their own charm, essence, and beauty, making it very hard to compare and choose only one or two from them.

But if the question is 'What is the most spectacular place I have ever been to?' there can only be one answer to that – ""The Grand Canyon"" of Arizona!

Carved by the mighty Colorado River, the Grand Canyon came into existence millions of years ago. Stretching over 445 kilometers with a depth of 6,000 feet, it is one of the world's largest and probably the most famous canyons in the world. The distance between its two rims is around 68 kilometers, and there is a trail that goes through the mountains and deserts to connect these two rims.

Even before coming to live here in the United States, it was on my bucket list to backpack this landscape just across the heart of this grand, Grand Canyon!

Finally, last winter I got a chance to check this thing off the list. Though the trail conditions would be a lot harder to negotiate in the winter and the cold would be extreme, there were a couple of reasons behind this decision.

The first one – permit. It's very hard to get a backpacking permit in the Grand Canyon National Park, due to its enormous popularity. The permits are released six months in advance, and often those are grabbed within a few days. But as the park rangers shut down all the amenities during the harsh winter months and the drinking water sources are also frozen, they do not issue a permit in advance for December – February period. You need to meet the rangers personally and inform your whole plan including route planning, and alternative options in case your preferred itinerary doesn't work. You have to also inform them about your plan for rationing and water management, knowledge about the terrain, appropriate gear, and previous experiences in a written document. You will get the permit only if you can convince them first!

The second reason was the much-desired seclusion from the crowd during the peak season. Though it was supposed to be a solo trek, after a fair amount of drama my friend Sabbir joined me at the very last moment. We flew to the vibrant city of Las Vegas and made a five-hour drive from there to the Kaibab National Forest, at the boundary of the Grand Canyon.

It was already around midnight when we reached there. We just wanted to set up the camp as soon as possible and get a good sleep before the adventure. It was not an easy job in that dark, freezing and snow-covered forest when the temperature was around -13⁰C. However, after some challenging 20-30 minutes, we could finish setting up the tent and go to sleep.

The next day, the hardest task was to convince the park rangers to get that permit. We had a very narrow time window because of our short leave and other commitments. So, we had only three days for this 68 km trek, which we would be doing with around 17-18 kg load in our backpacks!

No wonder the rangers were not pleased with our plan. And we were adamant. They were constantly saying the same thing, ""Look, whatever experiences on the mountains you have don't help here that much. It's a desert and you have never been to one! The dangers here are very different from the mountains. Let alone camping in the desert with no water source, you have to go 4,500 feet downhill at a stretch in this barren-sandy terrain and then you have to gain 5,500 feet more at a steep uphill stretch, that too in the knee-deep snow at the north rim! You cannot make this unless it's at least a 5-day itinerary.""

They indeed had a very good point, but we did not have that much time. We were not going to go back from halfway, either. So, the argument went on for almost half an hour until the officials gave up and approved our itinerary. Big win, we thought; but we were yet to know what such a trek in the desert can really do to our knees!

We started our trek the next morning from the south rim. Sun was shining bright on the red, rocky mountain faces. Some patches of white snow on those red walls were making the moments more magical. We were enjoying the view, but at the same time, we had to be very cautious too as the hard layer of ice on it made it extremely slippery. The trail spiralled all over the mountain, looking like a big snake going down the canyon. Following that 'snake', finally we got a clear view of the Colorado river – the mighty stream of water that over millions of years carved this canyon. When we got to the river, we had a view of both the rims. The majestic canyon was a jaw-dropping beauty, its utter vastness was reminding us every moment how tiny, weak, and vulnerable we are to the great power and the magnificence of nature!

After crossing the river, the trail started to get sandier as we entered the desert. The sun was scorching at this point, some discrete vegetation of cactuses was the only sign of life on that dead land. Though we were carrying enough water till the next campsite and sipping it at regular intervals, the moment the uphill trail started we were feeling exhausted. It continued for the rest of the day.

Eventually, the sun dimmed, and a dark veil was enveloping the surrounding landscape. And, a day after continuous walking through trails and through the desert, we felt our knees. They were hurting badly.

Eashan Hasan, a graduate teaching assistant at University of Tennessee, Knoxville, is an avid trekker and nature lover.

Finally, after what felt like a lifetime of hiking through that desert, we reached Cottonwood, our campsite for that night. Millions of stars were shining like pearls in the dark sky. With that heavenly beauty, we forgot all our pain as well as the freezing cold outside. We sat outside the tent, shivering, but spellbound with the just-cooked hot soup in our hands.

The next day we woke up before sunrise and started to hike just after having a quick meal. It was supposed to be a long day, as we had to reach the north rim and come back to this same campsite again before sunset. We heard the infamous rattling noise of the rattlesnakes a few times last night and did not want to get bitten by one in the dark. The trail uphill was way steeper, but it was more beautiful too. Numerous lines on the rocks reminded us of the timeless work of the river. The clear blue sky in contrast with the sun-kissed red rocky mountains created a surreal environment.

After a couple of hours of hiking, as we were getting near the north rim, the found snow and ice on the trail. And as we progressed, the snow got deeper and deeper. After hustling through knee-deep snow we finally reached the north rim around midday.

The north rim was looking like a winter wonderland—completely covered in deep white snow. We rested there for some time, had our food, roamed around the rim a little, and started to trek down – onto the same route to the cottonwood, to that mighty river, and finally to the south rim.

The phrase ""out of the world"" probably suits best to describe this magnificent creation – as it is indeed not unlike anything from this world! The colours, the structures, the lines, and the patterns, everything seems so alien that at a point you start to think that it just doesn't belong here; someone must have just picked it from outer space and put it here, right in the middle of our planet! No words or pictures really can do justice to its grandness, you can comprehend it only if you are there!

We were in the Grand Canyon for five days including the 3-day trek. Every moment there, we were in utter awe of this great wonder. But now it feels like those five days were just not enough; I wish I could touch and feel all those lines and patterns on the rocks, could hear their stories – what they are trying to say for millions and millions of years!

But only one life is too short to do that, I guess!",2023-05-12 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/hiking-through-alien-world-3318411,2023-05-18 10:29:04,thedailystar
503,Fire hazard in city markets: No lesson learnt,"Even after multiple fire incidents at Dhaka markets, authorities yet to take necessary measures

When one enters the building of Sharif Market on Chittaranjan Avenue in Sadarghat, there is a feeling of suffocation, despite the empty spaces between the eight-storey building. The building has been identified as risky in terms of fire safety. However, it only has nine fire extinguishers.

During a visit to the market, this correspondent found goods lying in its corridors, creating obstacles for smooth movement. Even the staircases were blocked by products.

However, this is not an isolated picture. Condition of most markets in the capital is similar, as the market authorities pay little to no attention when it comes to ensuring fire safety.

The fire service conducted a survey this year till April 15 on 58 markets in Dhaka and found nine of those to be extremely risky in terms of fire incidents.

Fourteen others were found moderately risky, while the remaining 35 have been labelled as risky.

Among the nine, several markets, including Rajdhani Super Market at Tikatuli and Barishal Plaza Market at Fulbaria, have increased the number of their fire extinguishers significantly. However, the installation of other fire-fighting equipment is still a far cry.

During recent visits to the markets labelled as extremely risky, the authorities' negligence in terms of ensuring fire safety was evident.

The nine highly risky markets include Gausia Market, Barishal Plaza Market, Rajdhani and New Rajdhani Supermarket, Alauddin Market, Shakil Anwar Tower, Sharif Market, Maya Katara, Shahidullah Market and Rosenil Vista.

Among the nine, several markets, including Rajdhani Super Market at Tikatuli and Barishal Plaza Market at Fulbaria, have increased the number of their fire extinguishers significantly. However, the installation of other fire-fighting equipment is still a far cry.

On April 15, Dhaka New Supper Market saw a massive fire which damaged at least 250 shops. The market authorities seem reluctant to improve their safety measures even after the incident.

This area at Gausia market houses multiple buildings with no space between them while all the sides remain blocked.

An electric short circuit might have caused the fire at Dhaka New Super Market, according to the investigators.

During a visit to the market on May 5, only two fire extinguishers were found on the three floors of the market. No other fire-fighting equipment was found.

The corridors and spaces in front of the shops were occupied with goods even though free spaces are an important factor to ensure fire safety.

The situation was similar at all the other adjoining markets, such as Chandrima Supper Market and Chandni Chowk.

Only around 10 fire extinguishers and 10 empty buckets were found at the Chandrima Super Market, which is only around 30 to 50 feet away from the fire-ravaged Dhaka New Super Market.

At the two-storey Shahidullah Market in Chawkbazar's Urdu Road, only two fire extinguishers were found. However, both expired three years ago, on March 20, 2020.

On the other hand, the Chandi Chawk Market has 17 fire extinguishers. Even those that have a sufficient number of fire extinguishers lack trained staffers to operate them. They mostly depend on the security guards to operate them.

Staircase of this market in Old Dhaka’s Siddik Bazar often remains occupied, making it difficult for people to walk.

Only three security guards were found trained to use fire extinguishers at Siddique Bazar's Rosenil Vista Market, which has 12 fire extinguishers for its multi-storey building. The first two floors of the building house shops while the next three floors warehouse.

Earlier in 2017, the Fire Service and Civil Defence surveyed 1,300 markets in the capital and found all the markets, except five, risky in terms of fire incidents.

Among those, 622 were found extremely risky, while 678 were found risky.

Kazi Abul Khayer, member secretary of Dhaka New Super Market Dokan Malik Samity, said they will set up a hose reel and implement the Fire Service Department's instructions.

Asked why only two fire extinguishers were found at their market, he said they have 60 fire extinguishers, which they have kept in the Samity's office room.

Manzur Ahmed, president of Chandrima Super Market Shop Owners Association, said they are waiting for the recommendations of the Fire Service Department and will take necessary steps following their advice.

""We have already started increasing the capacity of water in our reservoir and trained our security guards to deal with fire incidents,"" he said.

He also said most of their fire extinguishers have been sent to be refilled and have around 40 fire extinguishers in their stock.

Contacted, Lt Col Mohammad Tajul Islam Chowdhury, director (operation and maintenance) of the Fire Service Department, said fire safety measures depend on the building and its occupancy load.

""We notify the authorities concerned to take action in this regard. We plan to do it again,"" he said.

""We will provide recommendations such as drafting safety plans and implementing them properly when we conduct our visits. No further recommendations are needed. We will resume our visits shortly after involving different agents, such as Rajuk, the city corporations, Wasa, NSI and DGFI,"" he added.",2023-05-12 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/fire-hazard-city-markets-no-lesson-learnt-3318386,2023-05-18 10:29:05,thedailystar
504,Fire safety in a precarious state,"Adil Mohammad Khan in conversation with Star

Fire safety in Dhaka's market buildings is in a very precarious condition, which has increased vulnerabilities for people and properties associated with these markets. The recent fire incidents in Bangabazar and Dhaka New Super Market are testimonies of these harsh realities prevailing in the capital, said Dr Adil Mohammed Khan, executive director of Institute for Planning and Development (IPD), during an interview with The Daily Star yesterday.

Adil, a professor of the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at Jahangirnagar University, said the Bangabazar fire incident also portrays that despite the immense dedication of firefighters, the fire services department is still lagging in terms of capacities, which requires a massive improvement.

""Astonishingly, many markets owned and operated by both the city corporations in Dhaka are at risk of catching fire as well. Fire safety scenarios in the markets of Dhaka have not changed that much,"" said Adil.

""After the Bangabazar Fire incident, fire service reiterated after a short visit that most of the markets in the capital are quite unsafe and at risk of catching fire. They are devoid of appropriate fire safety measures as stipulated in fire service law or building codes and construction rules and regulations. There are risks in the gas, power and water supply lines of these markets as well,"" he added.

According to the building and fire safety rules, markets should have fire extinguishers, emergency stairs and elevators, fire sprinklers, and smoke detectors for ensuring fire safety, said Adil.

The fire service, city corporations or the building authorities only notify the market authorities to ensure fire safety. Other than that, no stringent measures have been taken in the last few years to protect these buildings from fire. Besides, the market authorities cannot avoid their responsibilities when it comes to negligence regarding fire safety. — Dr Adil Mohammed Khan Professor of the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at Jahangirnagar University

""Fire drills should be made regular for markets. However, they take place rarely in Dhaka's market buildings.""

""Safety audits for electric, gas and sewerage lines in the market should be conducted regularly. Walkway passages or emergency evacuation routes in the markets should be kept free all the time,"" added Adil.

Bangladesh National Building Code, which has important provisions regarding fire safety, is not being implemented in the absence of the Bangladesh Building Authority, as mentioned in the BNBC enacted in 2020.

""The fire service department, city corporations or the building authorities only notify the market authorities to ensure fire safety. Other than that, no stringent measures have been taken in the last few years to protect these buildings from fire,"" he said.

""The market authorities cannot avoid their responsibilities when it comes to negligence regarding fire safety. The Fire Prevention and Fighting Act, 2003, has enabled the fire service department to evacuate or close risky market buildings, which should be implemented if deemed necessary for any particular markets.""

""Ensuring fire safety in markets requires urgency, eagerness, effort, financial investment and regular monitoring. Market owners and the relevant authorities like the fire service, city corporations and Rajuk should work together to save valuable lives and properties from fire incidents of massive scales,"" added Adil.",2023-05-12 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/fire-safety-precarious-state-3318356,2023-05-18 10:29:06,thedailystar
505,Childhood trapped in ‘leguna’,"Over a hundred children working as human haulier helpers or drivers to support their families

""This is Mohammadpur, get off,"" a child yelled out to the passengers of a leguna, otherwise known as human hauliers, which had reached the area as early as 7:00am.

Dressed in drab clothes, evidently tired and overworked, the 12-year-old still had the innocence of his age etched all over his face.

He then called out, ""Next stop, Gabtoli! Gabtoli!""

When he was asked about his work schedule, the child said he remains on duty from 6:00am to 10:00pm, with only 20-minute breaks for lunch and dinner. The driver of the leguna, of which Abbas is a helper, helps cover the cost of his meals.

Despite the harsh realities of life that he is forced to face regularly, the child could not stop smiling when spoken to.

On good days, his earning varies between Tk 300 and Tk 400. Anything extra is taken by the driver.

This 16-year-old also works as a leguna driver.

Working as a helper for three years, he had to drop out of school when he was just in the third grade due to the demise of his father.

Abbas currently lives with his mother, an RMG worker in Chawkbazar, at Sabed Ali slum in the capital's Rayerbazar.

Like Abbas, 10-year-old Sabuj works as a leguna helper on a different route in Mohammadpur.

He began working at such a young age as his mother, a domestic help, could not help sustain their household expenses and his father has been bedridden for long due to an incurable disease.

Prior to Covid-19, there was an Out-of-School Children Education Programme, run by the non-formal education bureau, for children aged 9-14, who are most likely to drop out. The programme can be utilised to bring back most of the children who have left school during the pandemic period.

Sabuj has been working since he was only eight years old and earns Tk 300 per day.

A visit to the leguna routes in the capital revealed that countless children are employed as helpers. On Abbas's Gabtoli route alone, there are around 25 children working as leguna helpers.

According to the Children's Act 2013, working as a driver's assistant is identified as hazardous for those under 18 years of age. The labour and employment ministry on its official website has a list of jobs considered extremely hazardous for children. In it, ""driver's assistant"" or helper was one.

Despite these regulations, traffic police remain silent and do not take any action due to humanitarian reasons.

Speaking to this correspondent, an on-duty traffic sergeant in the Mohammadpur-Beribandh area, preferring anonymity, said, ""If we stop them [from working], their families will starve since they depend on their earnings.""

One of the reasons the number of children working as leguna helpers had increased was the Covid-19 pandemic.

During a recent visit to the leguna routes, it was found that the majority of children working are those who were compelled to discontinue their education during the Covid-19 period.

Many start working as leguna helpers at an early age.

Previously a madrasa student, Siam, 16, now works as a helper on the Jatrabari-Postogola leguna route. Around 40 more -- all of whom had to drop out of school for the pandemic's impact on their families' financial situation -- work alongside.

A Unicef and Unesco report, titled ""Situation Analysis on the Effects and Responses to Covid-19 on the Education Sector in Asia"", published in October 2021, revealed that pandemic-induced school closures since early 2020 affected the education of 37 million children in Bangladesh.

In contrast, the Annual Primary School Census (APSC) 2021, prepared by the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE), disclosed that the number of students dropped from 21,551,691 in 2020 to 20,090,057 in 2021 -- meaning there was a 1,461,634 fall.

Shah Rezwan Hayat, director general of DPE, said, ""DPE is working towards reintegrating these children back into school by increasing scholarships and the availability of non-formal education, and introducing half-day meals in primary schools from this October.""

This correspondent also found that older children were working as drivers. Though the National Transport Act stipulates that professional drivers must be at least 21 years old, there is little to no practical enforcement of this rule.

Speaking to some of the drivers, it was learnt that owners usually benefit from hiring children as helpers as it is cheaper than hiring adult helpers, and children can also work for longer hours.

Due to severely limited information, it's unclear how many children are involved in child labour. Thus, the government must ensure that all dropped-out children are included in the non-formal education system.

WHAT EXPERTS SAY

Speaking to The Daily Star, Prof M Wahiduzzaman of Dhaka University's Institute of Education and Research said there was an urgent need to bring children involved in labour back to mainstream education.

""Prior to Covid-19, there was an Out-of-School Children Education Programme, run by the non-formal education bureau, for children aged 9-14, who are most likely to drop out. The programme can be utilised to bring back most of the children who have left school during the pandemic period.

""Furthermore, providing vocational training and one-time financial assistance for education security, along with raising awareness among families and implementing these solutions as quickly as possible, can bring a considerable portion of the children back to the mainstream education system.""

Rasheda K Chowdhury, executive director for the Campaign for Popular Education, echoed the same and urged for the proper implementation of the government's non-formal education programme.

""Due to severely limited information, it's unclear how many children are involved in child labour. Thus, the government must ensure that all dropped-out children are included in the non-formal education system,"" she said.

THE ROUTES WITH MOST CHILDREN

The Mohammadpur area of the capital has four leguna routes -- Mohammadpur-Farmgate, Mohammadpur-Shyamoli, Dhaka University-Shyamoli, and Mohammadpur-Mohakhali.

Shockingly, one-third of the 125 helpers working on these routes are children who do not have access to education.

The Jatrabari area has over 10 operational leguna routes -- the highest in the capital.

The Jurain and Abdullahpur routes have 70 legunas, with at least 40 child labourers, operating almost 23 hours a day.

There is no specific information on the number of children working as helpers on legunas in different areas of the capital.

However, the Bangladesh Passenger Welfare Association conducted a survey in 2016 which revealed that 35 percent of the labourers on 85 Leguna routes in Dhaka were children.

Its secretary general Mozammel Haque Chowdhury said, ""The number has certainly increased since then.""

Delwar Hossein Chunnu, a member of Dhaka Metropolitan Human Haulier Owners Association, said children continue to work on legunas, despite efforts to stop child labour as they have no other means of earning a living and their families depend on them.

He suggested the government provides alternative opportunities for these children.

This 12-year-old works as a helper on Mohammadpur-Gabtoli route.

EFFORTS STILL ON

Due to the strict implementation of the Children Act 2013, child labour has become an issue of the past on several leguna routes in Dhaka.

The Daily Star's investigation found that no children are working on the Nilkhet-Chawk Bazar, Nilkhet-Gulistan, Nilkhet-Section, and Nilkhet-Farmgate routes.

Saiful Islam, a leguna driver on one of these routes, said they used to employ child helpers but had to stop due to strict enforcement of the law by the administration.

Similarly, no children are working in Gulistan, which has the largest leguna route. However, no helpers are employed there for cost-cutting purposes.

Mohammad Mujibur Rahman, additional commissioner (traffic) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, admitted that due to the abundance of leguna routes in Dhaka, they have been unable to entirely eliminate child labour in the sector.

""Nonetheless, we have managed to stop it in some routes by handing punishment to owners and drivers who employ children. Moreover, we are collaborating with various organisations to raise awareness,"" he added.

506,No place to call ‘home’,"Dhalpur’s Telegu community evicted without financial assistance, resource allocation

Prince, a 13-year-old was found playing with his friends amidst the ruins of the slum in a locality in Dhalpur. When asked where he was staying, his response was sombre as he and his family were now staying at a relative's house which was already crammed.

On February 12, Dhaka South City Corporation evicted Prince's family and 125 other Telugu families from their homes in the Telugu slum located in Jatrabari's Dhalpur area.

His mother said they were unable to take out a loan to build a house due to the high-interest rates.

The evicted families were given land next to the slum to build a house, but only those who could afford high-interest loans were able to do so.

DSCC claimed that the Telegu community occupied a portion of their 15-acre land, and the rest was occupied by a gang who built shops and slums for business.

Buildings in the Telegu community had become dilapidated and risky, and despite serving them several notices to vacate the area, they did not comply, leading to the eviction.

However, several organisations, including Bangladesh Hindu-Buddhist-Christian Oikya Parishad, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), and Manusher Jonno Foundation expressed outrage over the eviction without any effort to rehabilitate the community.

They termed it ""illegal, undemocratic, and whimsical"".

NHRC Chairman Kamal Uddin Ahmed sent a letter to the DSCC CEO before the eviction, requesting that they not be evicted without rehabilitation.

Despite this, 126 Telegu families were evicted and given a mere 150 square feet area where they would have to construct their homes. Some families are constructing houses by taking loans with hefty interest rates, while others are staying in overcrowded conditions with their relatives in different locations.

During a recent visit, this correspondent found that some workers were cleaning the bricks of the demolished slum. Only one NGO-run school, two churches, and a temple was seen standing in the ruins.

While visiting the new location which was given to construct new houses, this correspondent found that some Telugus were working to construct their homes while other areas remained empty.

Muraly Roy, a cleaner at Bangladesh Bidyut Unnayan Board, was busy constructing his house.

He shared that he had to take out a loan of Tk 70,000 from a local lender (Mahajan) with exorbitant interest rates.

He had initially borrowed the money with the intention of building a proper home for his family. Unfortunately, due to financial constraints, all he has been able to construct so far is a small, one-room tin-shed structure that can barely accommodate his family of six.

When asked where his family was currently residing, he said they were staying at one of his colleague's houses despite the cramped conditions there.

""I had to pursue the Mahajan (lender) for 10 days to borrow money to build my house. After 10 days, I was finally able to borrow a loan of Tk 80,000 with an eight percent interest,"" shared Bhangari Nokraju, who has been left desperate after the eviction.

According to Nokraju, authorities evict them and demolish their homes whenever they deem it necessary.

""I was allotted a tiny place to build the house, but no financial support was provided,"" he stated. ""How can we construct a house without any financial assistance?"" he asked.

Sexagenarian Durga Shetty summed up the despair of these people: ""When there was no one to work as sweepers here, the government brought us in. Now I don't even have the job of a sweeper. None of us have the funds to build a house. What do we have left? Where will we go?""

NO UTILITIES

The new location has left the community in a state of acute crisis as they have not been provided with any water, gas, or electricity. Furthermore, the dire situation was exacerbated by the fact that only 20 toilets were constructed, which are in such a deplorable condition that they are barely usable.

As this correspondent was preparing to leave, a woman named Orinika, 40, said, ""Brother, I implore you to help us secure access to water, electricity, and gas connections here.""

She went on to explain that her family had depleted their savings in order to construct their home, leaving them with insufficient funds to purchase drinking and cooking water.

Muktala Lashmi, another woman present there said, ""While it may be possible to live without gas and electricity, one cannot survive without water.""

When asked about their water source for drinking, cooking, and toilet use at present, they said that they collect water from a nearby building, which is difficult to attain.

What RIGHTS ACTIVISTS SAY

Advocate Rana Dasgupta, a leader of the Hindu-Buddhist-Christian Oikya Parishad, raised concerns over the eviction of the Telegu community and expressed dismay at the inhumane conditions they are currently facing.

He said, ""When the eviction process started, I visited the spot and personally intervened with Mayor Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, requesting him not to evict the community without proper rehabilitation.""

The mayor had promised to construct two six-storied buildings and provide permanent rehabilitation for the Telegu community.

They were also promised jobs as cleaners. However, Advocate Dasgupta later discovered that the community was left without basic necessities such as water, electricity, and shelter.

NHRC Chairman Kamal Uddin Ahmed has strongly emphasised that evicting people without proper rehabilitation is a violation of their basic human rights. In fact, the High Court has also stated in several verdicts that no community can be evicted without adequate rehabilitation measures in place.

""We have issued multiple letters cautioning against eviction without rehabilitation,"" Ahmed stated, adding, ""Upon learning about their current state, we have sent a notice to city corporation directing that they provide the necessary water, electricity, and gas connections immediately, taking into account the humanitarian aspect.""

Although the mayor has assured the NHRC chairman that he will solve the community's problems, the delay is due to the tender process, Ahmed said quoting the mayor.

According to him, the community is still lagging behind.

""They are an isolated community and have not been able to integrate with the rest of the country, despite providing essential services to the country's people for a long time,"" he added.

WHAT THE AUTHORITIES SAY

According to DSCC Spokesperson Abu Naser, 126 Telugu families have been allotted spaces for building houses.

He said, ""Until the construction of new buildings, they will stay there temporarily by building houses.""

He shared details of their plan for the slum, stating that they intend to construct two six-story buildings on a five-acre plot of land to rehabilitate the community.

Additionally, the remaining 10-acre area would be utilised for the development of a central motor garage.

He added that a total of 20 toilets have already been built for them there. Spaces for temples and churches had also been determined.

However, when asked about the absence of basic utilities in the area, he said they are currently working on it and the problem will be addressed as soon as possible.

HOW THE COMMUNITY GOT HERE

M Kamal, president of Telegu Samaj Unnayan Parishad, said the British government brought their ancestors from the Indian state of Telangana to the region to work as cleaners.

The British government assigned one group to work in the tea gardens while another group was tasked with cleaning the cities. However, their basic rights were not guaranteed and they were forced to work as cleaners for the city dwellers.

During his childhood, Kamal resided in the Tikatuli colony but later on, they were relocated to Sayedabad area during the Ershad regime. After spending 35 years there, the community was shifted to the Dhalpur area in 1990, which was subsequently renamed as the Telugu slum.",2023-04-28 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/no-place-call-home-3306911,2023-05-18 10:29:09,thedailystar

""Pakistani soldiers broke into our house through the backyard. Sensing their presence, three of my nephews gathered in one room. Another managed to flee. The soldiers entered our house firing indiscriminately killing the 3 helpless boys. They fell on the floor just like logs. …

In another room, I was hiding under a bed silently praying to Allah to save me. There were so many pots and pans in front of me underneath the bed that the soldiers did not notice me. I was extremely thirsty. While waiting under that bed, the soldiers shot dead another of my nephew.""

In another room, I was hiding under a bed silently praying to Allah to save me. ... While I was waiting there, the soldiers shot dead another of my nephew."" — Ershad Sarder a survivor of Jinjira's Sarder family massacre

Ershad Sarder, a survivor of Jinjira's Sarder family massacre, was narrating his ordeal with teary eyes. Ershad alone buried at least 20 bodies on that day.

On April 2, 1971, during the Jinjira massacre, most of the houses in Keraniganj's Jinjira, Kalindi and Shubhadda areas went through similar ordeals to the Sarder family.

It could never be confirmed how many were actually killed during the Jinjira massacre. According to eyewitnesses, up to 5,000 people were killed by the Pakistan army on that day.

It could never be confirmed how many were actually killed during the Jinjira massacre. According to eyewitnesses, up to 5,000 people were killed by the Pakistan army on that day.

After the mass killing of March 25, many people who fled Dhaka took shelter in these villages crossing the Buriganga river. These villages, mostly inhabited by the Hindus, were considered strongholds of the Awami League. In the initial days of Bangladesh's Liberation War, many top leaders of the Awami League including Tajuddin Ahmad fled Dhaka through Jinjira. Influential student leaders including Shajahan Siraj, Tofail Ahmed, and Serajul Alam Khan took shelter there.

Receiving intelligence reports that Awami League was getting secretly organised in Jinjira through its student leaders, the Pakistan army decided to launch a raid. One of the masterminds of Operation Searchlight, brigadier general Jahanzeb Arbab devised the plan which was executed by brigadier general Rashid.

By that time, the military surrounded the area with barbed wire and bamboo fences so that nobody could escape the carnage. Some soldiers started firing at the village. Frightened, people were running to and fro but they were surrounded from all sides. Mostofa Mohsin Montu an eyewitness of the massacre and Dhaka district commander of Mukti Bahini

As per the plan, Pakistani troops took position at Mitford hospital with heavy weaponry. Mortars and machine guns were placed on the roof of Pori Bibi's mosque. Troops crossed the river and landed in the villages of Jinjira, Kalindi and Shubhadda unions through gunboats.

At around 5:00am, Brigadier Rashid fired a flare and signalled the troops to start the raid. Then and then Pakistani soldiers started one of the most horrific massacres in the history of our country, setting fire to houses and bazaars using gunpowder and killing civilians indiscriminately.

Julhas Mian, an inhabitant of south Mandail, recently narrated his ordeal to The Daily Star.

""After the massacre of March 25, we started patrolling outside the village so that we can know beforehand when they would come. On that morning, I went to the river bank and saw five gunboats full of Pakistani soldiers had just arrived. Some of the soldiers got down from the boat and asked me where Narikelbaria was. They also asked about the location of student leader Mostofa Mohsin Montu's house.

After the encounter, I ran back home. Sensing the situation, my family members had already started to flee. I joined them and went to the mosque of Borhanibag village. Thousands of people had already gathered at the mosque. One of the houses adjacent to the mosque was burnt to the ground by the Pakistani soldiers. A man said seven people were killed by the soldiers there.

I felt the mosque was not safe either. So, I decided to go back home through the paddy fields and found numerous dead bodies there. Reaching home, I found several dead bodies on the banks of our pond. We took the wounded to the Mitford hospital and buried the dead bodies.""

Saiful Islam, an inhabitant of East Mandail village and another eyewitness of Jinjira massacre, told The Daily Star, ""The situation was beyond description. Some of the people died on the spot, and those left injured were screaming for water. The entire Hindu block of our village was razed to the ground by the Pakistan army. Some of our neighbours hid in the jungle as they learnt about the incoming raid. When the soldiers left the village, we asked them to come out but nobody responded. Later, we found their lifeless bodies in the thicket.""

Saiful claimed that at least 5,000 people were slaughtered on that day.

The situation was beyond description. Some of the people were killed on the spot, and those who were injured were screaming for water. The entire Hindu block of our village was razed to the ground by the Pakistan army. — Saiful Islam eyewitness of Jinjira massacre

On April 3, 1972, a report by Saiful Islam was published in the daily Dainik Bangla titled ""Hellish brutality in Jinjira''. That report has been included in the 8th volume of the official historical records of the Liberation War of Bangladesh (Bangladesher Shadhinota Juddho Dalilpatra).

The report read like this, ""As the night dawned, inhabitants of Keraniganj were still sleeping. Suddenly loud bangs of guns and mortars pierced through the silence of the dawn. The Pakistani soldiers started the killing spree. The whole area was filled with cries and people's pleas to live. Frightened, shocked people tried to flee. … Frightened people couldn't decide what to do as they were surrounded ….

Houses of Jinjira, Kalindi and Shubhadda unions were ransacked and burnt and hundreds of mothers and sisters were raped. Each and every house of these three unions was attacked. Finally, when the killing spree was stopped on the command of Brigadier Bashir, it left behind a series of horror tales in the memory of survivours.""

A number of mass killings on that fatal day have been well documented.

On April 2, more than four hundred people were lined up and gunned down by the Pakistan army in a single place called Monu Miar Dhal. Later, a memorial was erected in that place in memory of all people martyred in Keraniganj during the Liberation War. Besides, 60 people were killed on the bank of a pond adjacent to

Mandail main road. The soldiers killed 11 women in one house of Kalindi village.

Mostofa Mohsin Montu, Dhaka district commander of Mukti Bahini and a famous student leader at that time, told The Daily Star, ""After the massacre of 25th March, I came to Keraniganj along with the national leaders and the leaders of Bangladesh Chhatra League. Although the national leaders left for the border, leaders of Chhatra League were with me. Pakistani soldiers were informed about our

presence in that area.

On April 1, a doctor of Mitford Hospital secretly informed me that some Pakistani officers were keeping close surveillance on Keraniganj using telescopes. They were also amassing mortar shells and ammunition on the roof of the hospital. I conveyed this information to all my contacts without any delay. However, we could not realise that they would launch the raid within such a short time.

Pakistani soldiers took position in the canals using gunboats at around 2:00am. At 3:00am, I learned that Pakistani soldiers crossed the river and landed in Jinjira. At 4:00am, the soldiers got the signal from Pari Bibi's mosque.

By that time, the military surrounded the area with barbed wire and bamboo fences so that nobody could escape the carnage. Some

We started to flee [seeing the soldiers]. ... We found several dead bodies when we returned home several days after the massacre. Some of the dead bodies floated away through the canal and some were buried by the villagers. Sahadeb Chandra Mondol an eyewitness of Jinjira massacre

soldiers started firing at the village. Frightened, people were running to and fro but they were surrounded from all sides.

They kept firing at the village for three hours. Till 11:00am, they conducted house to house searches and killed many people.""

After Jinjira union, Shubhadda union bore the brunt of the Pak military's cruelty. During the massacre, poet Nirmalendu Goon took shelter at a Shubhadda village mosque.

In ""Jinjira Genocide 1971"", Goon described the horrific atrocities committed by the Pakistan military. ""When I reached the mosque courtyard, it was overcrowded. I saw several dead and wounded bodies in the mosque courtyard. Some of them were lying and some of them were upside down. … It was hard to tell if they were still alive or not. They were bleeding profusely,"" he wrote.

Another eyewitness of that massacre Sahadeb Chandra Mondol of Madhya Shubhadda village told The Daily Star, ""Pakistani army started firing arbitrarily as soon as they entered the village through the canal. That forced us to flee from our homes. Many of us got killed. We found several dead bodies when we returned home several days after the massacre. Some of the dead bodies were floated away through the canal and some were buried by the villagers.""

Mohammad Almas, an inhabitant of Par Gendaria village of Shubhadda union said he counted at least 30 dead bodies in his neighbourhood.

After this massacre, Pakistani military administration launched a propaganda campaign. On April 2, 1971, they broadcasted that Pakistan army had subdued the separatist miscreants who took shelter in Keraniganj on the other side of the Buriganga river. On April 3, the headline of the daily Morning News, a newspaper that served the Pakistan army, was ""Action against miscreants at Jinjira"".

Jahanara Imam wrote in his book ""Ekattorer Dinguli"" about the massacre.

""I was shocked to read the headline of Morning News. It said, Action against miscreants at Jinjira. I was hearing from the day before that Pakistani soldiers bombed the villages of Jinjira and many people were killed there. So, were the apprehensions true?!""

People of this generation may not comprehend the scale of brutality the people of Jinjira faced on that day. But that does not matter for people like Ershad who lost their loved ones. They still shiver remembering the shocking scenes of the carnage that unfolded before their eyes.

508,Bangladesh boxing poised for growth spurts,"The Beximco XBC Fight Night in Dhaka had recently created some buzz among the ones fascinated with professional boxing.

Undoubtedly, the participation of London-born kickboxer Ruqsana Begum -- the former Muay Thai world champion who made her transition into the world of boxing -- whose first appearance as a boxer playing in her country of origin was the main catalyst behind the uprising of interest.

The 39-year-old Ruqsana made her debut in Bangladesh and came out victorious but young local boxer Tanjila Tanjila pushed her to the limit in a captivating 10-round fight to bag the WBU Intercontinental Championship title in the flyweight category.

Adnan Harun, chairman of the Bangladesh Boxing Foundation (BBF), was oozing with optimism regarding the refreshing development and its potential impact in the local circuit.

""You know India started professional boxing six to seven years back while Pakistan also made their journey at the same time. The popularity of professional boxing has been gaining a much better pace in Pakistan due to Amir Khan, who is a British boxer but of Pakistani origin. We also believe Ruqsana's participation will garner more interest among our young generation,"" said Adnan.

Professional boxing is a fresh venture in the country and, of late, it has moulded into a concrete form with two recent international events, garnering attention among sports enthusiasts, especially with successes of boxers Sura Krishna Chakma and Mohammed Al Amin in the first-ever professional boxing tournament in Bangladesh last year.

""We just started our journey only one-and-a-half years back and we already have 25-30 male and 10-12 female professional boxers, so the number is encouraging. And I must say, the success of our first-ever grand-scale professional event, which was telecasted live for the first time in the country, will change the scenario of professional boxing in our country,"" the BBF chairman added.

He further informed the federation had only been focusing on grooming boxers for light-weight categories due to physical limitations.

""In reality, we are not in a position to develop good heavyweight boxers due to our natural physique,"" Adnan said.

There were seven fights featuring 14 male and female boxers from around the world who participated in the recent event, where Sura Krishna knocked out Anan Pongkhet of Thailand in the lightweight division.

At present, a seven-member ad-hoc committee of BBF is pinning hope on Sura Krishna to bring professional boxing in further limelight.

""Sura Krishna is a natural talent. I can tell you, he will become Asian champion within a very short period of time. And his success along with other new talents will definitely usher new hope among young participants,"" Adnan went on.

""Apart from some minor events, we are planning to organise one or two international events every year. And alongside developing young talent, we are focusing on rankings because without good rankings you will not get any invitations from global promoters and, thus, cannot boost your financial strength. And that's the reason we are not unnecessarily going for heavyweight boxers.

""You know, Sura Krishna is also a lightweight boxer and he has got all the potential to become the country's icon.""

The BBF chairman put forth further optimism while acknowledging a talented boxer like Abu Talha Hridoy -- who had given Bangladeshis a big reason to cheer as he defeated Indian boxer Ashish Kumar in a Bantamweight clash -- and Utshob Ahmed.

A big stepping stone in Bangladesh professional boxing came to fruition as the country hosted, for the very first time, the WBU Female Intercontinental Championship with the belt at stake.

In a recent interview with The Daily Star, Ruqsana revisited her inspiring journey as the empowered athlete looks to inspire Bangladeshi boxers.

Many sportswomen in Bangladesh can relate to the obstacles that she had to face in the UK, so it is understandable to any Bangladeshi woman how big the challenge to flourish is, especially in a sport like boxing.

Ruqsana, however, addressed encouraging growth in changing attitudes towards female sports in the UK, resonating with Adnan who witnessed positive vibes among the Bangladeshi female boxers.

""I think there were definitely so many obstacles, going into a male-dominated sport. You know, even if you look at the women's football team in the UK, it's only now they're getting the platform and the recognition that they deserve, and they're excelling. You know, the country's media is behind them … the pay gap has been closing, which is excellent for the sport,"" said Ruqsana.

In Tanjila, Ruqsana faced a fierce competitor who is 20 years younger than her but displayed a lot of nerves and steel at the beginning as she punched above her weight throughout the fight to bring the best out of the world kickboxing champion.

While Sura Krishna is making the stride for a better future, promising aspects like Tanjila are providing the new sporting venture in the country hopes aplenty.

The BBF chairman concluded, ""I also believe our female participants are getting the platform to excel. I'm really hopeful they will bring laurels for the country in the very near future.""",2023-03-31 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/bangladesh-boxing-poised-growth-spurts-3285586,2023-05-18 10:29:12,thedailystar
509,Sura Krishna targets Asian zenith,"""Recently when I visited my locality in Rangamati, people inquired about professional boxing and how their children can pursue their passion in the sport. It gives me a lot of pleasure,"" said a thoroughly content Sura Krishna Chakma, Bangladesh's first professional boxer and the champion of the first international professional boxing tournament held in the country last year.

Moreover, the way a young Tanjila Tanjila fought neck-to-neck against a celebrated competitor in Ruqsana Begum, Sura Krishna has ample reasons to believe that Bangladesh boxing's future is brighter than what was previously assumed.

""There were few people who would tell me that there is no point in boxing because neither future nor financial security was in it,"" Sura Krishna told The Daily Star in an interview.

The 28-year-old believes that the challenges remain the same for him and his peers after having witnessed the transformation in people's perception, albeit not in leaps and bounds.

""I think the recent international event [WBU Intercontinental Championship] was a great success. In addition, Tanjila's performance gave me hope. My thought was that she would be knocked out [by Ruqsana] early but her fighting spirit just surprised me,"" Sura Krishna said with pride.

He continued, ""On the other hand, I'm very much pleased with my performance as I had beaten a superior Thai opponent in my maiden six-round fight. Now my Asian rankings will improve and, hopefully, I'll be eligible for an eight-round fight so that I can compete for a title and improve on financial grounds.""

""I can give you just one example to understand the obstacle we are facing: I need to spend more or less Tk 40,000 monthly for my nutrition, practice and other expenses. Now the question is, from where I will get this money,"" he informed.

""There is potential but without facilities and foundation you cannot achieve your desired goals [in big international events],"" opined Sura Krishna, who however believes that he can achieve the highest laurels in Asian competitions but the path remains tricky.",2023-03-31 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/sura-krishna-targets-asian-zenith-3285581,2023-05-18 10:29:13,thedailystar
510,‘Always a fighter’ Tanjila packs a punch,"""Yes, my name is Tanjila Tanjila,"" the rookie boxer only laughed when asked about why she lacks a conventional surname.

Tanjila, who recently hogged the spotlight with her spirited show against a vastly superior counterpart in Ruqsana Begum, shares a common narrative when it comes to the struggle sportswomen from all spectrum of life face in Bangladesh and beyond.

""Actually, I'm very introverted in nature and may not be able to explain everything to you,"" a soft-spoken Tanjila told The Daily Star.

""I started boxing five years back but, unfortunately, I was out of boxing for nearly two years as my father and elder brother were not interested in making boxing a profession. People in our locality also made many negative remarks, often telling me that it's not good for a girl to play such a sport,"" the girl from Jessore continued.

""My mother, however, encouraged me from the beginning and it was all down to her support that I could return to the ring again. I always love to fight.""

Asked what got her to venture into boxing, Tanjila informed, ""I live in Jessore and I often had gone to watch a boxing match with my friends and gradually the sport grew on me. Another reason is, I'm not a fan of team games … which was another reason why I chose it.""

Apparently, she was not well aware about Ruqsana's stature and had only received the brief about her opponent from her coach just a short while before the main event.

""Many had doubts about whether I could last 10 rounds and yes, I was initially a bit nervous. You know what my main strength is? I never underestimate myself in any sphere of my life,"" said Tanjila as she now has her focus reserved on training.",2023-03-31 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/always-fighter-tanjila-packs-punch-3285556,2023-05-18 10:29:14,thedailystar

A dilapidated tin-shed stands precariously at Bittipara area in Kushtia.

For someone new to the area, the three-roomed structure looks like any old building decaying with the ravages of time. But this crumbling structure is a silent witness to crimes against humanity carried out by the marauding Pakistani army and their local collaborators during the 1971 Liberation War.

It was originally the office of the ""Cotton Development Board"" but during the war, it became a torture centre and mass killing site of the Pakistani army.

""The Pak army, along with local collaborators, would pick up people from various areas and mercilessly torture them there,"" says Abdul Latif Biswas, a freedom fighter, now in his late 70s.

Opposite the building, there is an area filled with bushes. It is believed to be the place where the Pak army buried many of the Bangalees they killed, he said.

""The killers used to play music loudly on loudspeakers so that others could not hear the victims' screams. ... Everyone was hacked to death with their hands and legs tied. One of my cousins was pregnant then. Her stomach was cut off,"" said Halim Haque.

Apart from the Cotton Board Office, there were two more torture centres in the locality. Locals say how the Pakistani army tortured their victims still sends shivers down their spine.

Pakistanis picked up Bangalees from Kushtia, Chuadanga, Meherpur and other places and brought them to Bittipara. On many occasions, they were blindfolded with their hands tied behind them. They shot, beheaded and bayoneted them. Many women were killed after rape. Many bodies were buried in a single grave, according to the locals.

US based filmmaker Anindo Atik, has made a 103-minute documentary titled ""Battle of Kushtia"" where he vividly describes the genocide in the district especially at Bittipara.

According to the documentary, freedom fighter Abdul Motleb's father was dragged there. He was forced to dig his grave and buried alive.

Talking to The Daily Star, Anindo Atik says, ""Bittipara is one of the largest killing fields in the country that remains uncared for. Although a memorial was built in the area, there is no mention at the memorial of what happened there.""

Rafiqul Islam, a local of Bittipara, says workers found five skulls when they were digging a piece of land while constructing the foundation of his building. The skulls were later handed over to the authorities of a privately-run genocide museum in Khulna.

The Pakistani army carried out atrocities in many other places in Kushtia.

Kohinoor Villa is one of the killing sites situated in Deshwali Para in Kushtia town. Locally known as ""Ekattorer Roktakto Bari"", Biharis and local collaborators slaughtered at least 17 people there on the night of September 18, 1971.

Of the deceased, 16 were from the families of two brothers -- Rabiul Haque Mallick and Arshed Haque Mallick, who were owners of the villa. The reason for the killing was that the family used to help freedom fighters.

Rabiul's nephew Halim Haque who came back from India after the Liberation War and is now living in Kushtia, says he came to know the details of the brutalities from locals.

""I have no words to describe the atrocities committed by Pakistanis. The killers used to play music loudly on loudspeakers so that others could not hear the victims' screams,"" he adds.

""Everyone was hacked to death with their hands and legs tied. One of my cousins was pregnant then. Her stomach was cut off,"" he says.

The next morning, the locals found bodies lying haphazardly in the bathroom, kitchen, and corridors of the residence. Some bodies were also dumped in the drains. Bodies of the female victims were found undressed and the killers also looted valuables from the house.

Freedom fighters in Kushtia say the Pakistani forces inflicted their rage on the people of the town so brutally because they had been defeated by the freedom fighters on March 30-31, 1971 – the early days of the war.

When the Pakistan army was approaching Kushtia to recapture it on April 16 and 17, they virtually set fire to all houses that came their way.

Giving a description of the savagery, Gawher Nayeem Wahra, a climate change and disaster management expert from Kushtia, refers to the events of April 17, 1971.

Around 25-26 men, women and children of two families took shelter in a deep hole between Ganges-Kobadak Irrigation Project canal and railway line in Chandinagar of Bheramara, to save their lives on that day.

The Pakistani military was going to Mirpur in Kushtia through that way. Unfortunately those who were hiding were discovered by the soldiers who promptly killed 18 people with brush fire in the blink of an eye. The entire pit was filled with blood.

A pregnant woman died in the brush fire, but her child was born. One of the surviving relatives took the baby, he says.

This brutal killing is included in Gawher's book titled ""Ekattorer Samajik Itihas: Prottokhodorshi Boyane"" based on testimonies of eyewitnesses.

In Kushtia town, Pakistani forces in association with local collaborators picked six persons from different families of Thanapara on the night of August 28 and took them to the bank of the Gorai river. One of them was released and remaining four were killed, says Gawher.

Several boatmen who came from Doulatpur to sell the firewood in the town happened to be there. Three or four boatmen were killed. The Pak Army did not spare anyone.

""They threw all the bodies into the river,"" he said.

An area stretching 4 kilometres from Renwick Badh to Kushtia Maha Shamshan (crematorium), on the bank of the Gorai River, are mass killing sites and mass graves, according to Lalim Haque, a freedom fighter of the area.

The Pakistan Army base was in Kushtia police lines while Roxy Cinema Hall was the headquarters of the peace committee and the Biharis. After torturing Bangalees in these two places, they were shot or slaughtered at a solitary place beside the railway or the char of the Gorai river, say locals.

Abul Ahsan Chowdhury, a retired professor at Islamic University, Kushtia, says the forces tortured and killed Kushtia Mahila College teacher Durgadas Saha; renowned singer Meer Ahia; footballer Sarwardy; and businessmen Rafiq Ahmed and Hasan Foyez, among many others, during the Liberation War.

512,‘Like a morning after a nuclear attack’,"A World Bank team that visited different areas of war-torn Bangladesh in June 1971 likened Kushtia to a bombed-out ""WWII German town"".

Shocked by the atrocities committed by the Pakistani military, the team during their short visit found people there ""dazed"" and ""terrified"".

The team visited Jashore, Khulna, Chalna and Kushtia from June 3 to 6 in 1971 and depicted the devastation and atrocities by the Pakistani army in a report.

On April 15, some 20 days after the genocide in Dhaka, the Pakistani army moved into Kushtia from Jhenaidah.

The team, which roamed Kushtia for one and a half hours, in its report noted the utter devastation of the town. After overcoming the ""strong resistance"" from the freedom fighters in the early days, the army's punitive action devastated the town, it said.

""It was like the morning after a nuclear attack,"" said Hendrik Van der Heijden, a member of the team and an economist at the World Bank posted in Pakistan, said after visiting Kushtia.

""It lasted 12 days and left Kushtia virtually deserted and destroyed"", he said.

The military brutality reduced the population in Kushtia town to 5,000 from 40,000. The report said ninety percent of the houses, shops, banks and other buildings were destroyed.

""The city looked like a WWII German town having undergone strategic bombing attacks. People were sitting around dazed,"" it said.

""I asked them [officials of Pakistan] to show me a shop where food was being sold. … It was impossible to find one. Kushtia, as someone told me, is the Mỹ Lai of the West Pakistan Army,"" Hendrik said referring to the infamous massacre in the Vietnam War.

On March 16, 1968, American soldiers indiscriminately slaughtered more than 500 civilians, including young girls and women, in a Vietnamese village called Mỹ Lai.",2023-03-24 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/morning-after-nuclear-attack-3279936,2023-05-18 10:29:17,thedailystar
513,Sitakunda’s curse of industrial accidents,"In Sonaichhari union alone -- where both BM depot and Sheema Oxygen Plant are located -- there are around 50 shipbreaking yards, several re-rolling mills, oxygen plants and one LP gas plant

Three devastating explosions and fire incidents in Sitakunda's industrial units within nine months have created panic among its residents who live in close vicinity of such units.

Since the pre-liberation era, several industrial units have been set up in Chattogram's Sitakunda due to being close to the country's premier seaport and the Dhaka-Chattogram highway.

However, the upazila has been rapidly industrialised in the last couple of decades in an unplanned manner. Industrial units have been set up near the residential areas, that too without proper safety measures. All three latest catastrophic incidents unravelled the absence of workers' safety equipment and a lack of regular monitoring by the industry authorities, according to experts.

On June 4 last year, a fire and explosion at a private inland container depot (ICD) -- BM Container Depot -- at Keshabpur ward in Sonaichhari union, claimed the lives of 51 people. The incident left more than 200 injured and damaged a huge quantity of import and export containers.

On March 4, exactly nine months later, at least seven people were killed and over 25 were injured after a huge explosion at Sheema Oxygen Plant in the same ward and within less than one kilometre away from the BM Depot.

The latest incident occurred on Saturday morning. A massive fire that broke out at a cotton warehouse, owned by Unitex Spinning Mill at Chhoto Kumira under Kumira union, took around 30 hours of frantic efforts of firefighters from the Fire Service and Civil Defence and members of the armed forces to douse the blaze.

BM Depot

The warehouse stored around 2,700 tonnes of cotton.

According to firefighters, the warehouse had no fire safety equipment to douse the primary blaze.

Sitakunda has frequently made headlines for accidents inside shipbreaking yards, steel re-rolling mills and other factories. In the past 18 years, 251 workers have been killed in accidents at shipbreaking yards in the upazila.

Among the seven deceased in the Sheema Oxygen Plant blast last week, two people died after metal fragments from the blast flew and hit them at Kadamrusul Bazar and Saleh Carpet areas, both nearly half a kilometre away from the site.

BM Depot

In both incidents, the blasts were heard from several kilometres away and shattered windowpanes of houses nearly a kilometre away from the sites. Many of the injured in the Sheema plant blast suffered from a loss of hearing. Many residents complained of health-related problems due to toxic fumes from the BM Depot fire last year.

In Sonaichhari union alone -- where both BM depot and Sheema Oxygen Plant are located -- there are around 50 shipbreaking yards, several re-rolling mills, oxygen plants and one LP gas plant, said Union Parishad Chair Monir Ahmed. Most of these industries are located within residential areas.

""Previously, we witnessed accidents inside factory premises. But now residents in nearby areas are also getting killed or injured,"" Monir said.

A homemaker, who resides on the ground floor of a three-story building within 200 yards of Sheema Plant, said several windowpanes of the building got damaged due to the blast last week.

""Metal pieces flew and landed in the front yard of the house where our children play. It seems we are now not safe at all even at our homes,"" she said.

Salim Ullah, a resident of Kadamrusul area, who was on the balcony of his rented house around half a kilometre from the oxygen plant during the blast, said he could feel the impact as though a strong earthquake had hit.

Cotton warehouse

He also said the place where the metal fragment landed and killed a person is not far from his house.

""My family is in a state of constant panic. I feel like we are sitting on bombs,"" he said.

Shamsul Alam, a resident of Keshabpur, built a house around four years ago just 500 feet away from Sheema Oxygen Plant. During last year's explosion at BM Depot, two window panes of his house were damaged, which have recently been repaired.

However, during the oxygen plant blast, metal fragments hit different parts of his house, damaging the walls, the main gate and the window panes.

""I was about to go out when I heard the blast. My wife fainted after hearing the sound,"" said the 65-year-old.

There are four to five factories, including two oxygen plants, in close vicinity of his house, said Shamsul.

Sitakunda Upazila Chairman SM Al Mamun said most of these industries were set up in an unplanned manner near the residential areas.

""The government is developing economic zones and those are suitable places for such heavy industries. Regular monitoring by the respective authorities of these units can avert such deadly accidents,"" he added.

Meanwhile, no relevant government body has the exact figure on how many industrial units are in the upazila.

Officials of the Department of Inspections for Factories and Establishments (DIFE) failed to provide the data when the deputy commissioner (DC) of Chattogram asked for it during a meeting on March 5, following the blast in the oxygen plant.

According to a DIFE official, a total of 335 industries are currently in operation in Barabkunda, Sonaichhari, Bhatiary and Fouzderhat areas of the upazila. Among these, there are 85 shipbreaking yards, 37 steel rerolling mills, three oxygen plants and 204 other small and large industries, he mentioned, wishing anonymity.

However, according to Sitakunda Upazila Nirbahi Officer Shahadat Hossain, around 480 small and large industries are located here.

As many as 12 LP gas plants have been set up in only two villages of the upazila, leaving villagers worried about their safety, said sources.

Contacted, Chattogram DC Abul Bashar Mohammad Fakhruzzaman admitted that the data provided by the UNO is not updated.

""We are going to start a survey in this regard and initiate drives soon to ensure fire safety and other compliances in the Sitakunda industrial unit,"" said the DC.",2023-03-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/sitakundas-curse-industrial-accidents-3273976,2023-05-18 10:29:18,thedailystar
514,The need for proper exposure in ‘herstory’,"It seems that culturally we are inclined, as if somewhat programmed, to do the bare minimum in providing deserving attention and a wide-scale media coverage when it comes to women's sport in the country despite the fact that women athletes have had been giving their all, working just as hard as their male counterparts, day in day out over the years.

Take the case of Bangladesh women's national team's maiden SAFF triumph in September last year, for instance, when Sabina Khatun and company defeated hosts Nepal to present the country with a trophy that eluded the men's team since 2003.

Following the historic victory at Kathmundu's Dasharath Rangasala Stadium, it was quite bizarre that it almost took forever for the Bangladesh Football Federation's (BFF) official Facebook page to publish the news while many of the success-starved football fans in the country, in the midst of celebration, kept reloading the BFF fan page but only to find the latest post in the form of results of some men's domestic matches that had taken place that day.

It can be said that to nit-pick over the activity of a social media handle is unnecessary but when it comes to this day and age, the power of internet's flow of information to reach on a massive scale has matched the television, if not surpassed it, courtesy of the accessibility of budget-friendly smartphones. A study commissioned by Sky Sports in the UK has shown in 2021 that 32% of people in a survey, conducted since March, 2020, had learned more about women's sport through advertising and social media, while a two-third majority cited an increase in broadcast coverage as their reason for increased attention in the field. Thus, it becomes paramount that the powerful tools are not left unused when Bangladesh football has continued to fail in churning out success, in quantitative terms to say the least, leaving its once-passionate supporters demoralised and pessimistic of the future.

And equally, if not more, strange was how that tournament got little to no national television coverage as supporters resorted to live online streaming at elevensports.com. It was only up until the final that T Sports -- country's lone television channel dedicated to sports coverage -- decided to telecast after mighty India – the then reigning champions, winners of all five editions prior – were forced to exit the semi-finals by the women in red and green in their marauding run to the finale.

I am facing different obstacles despite being a South Asian Games gold medallist. For example, I can't lead the training session whereas a bronze medallist male karateka leads the training session as a senior player despite having no experience of how to lead a team. — Karateka Marzan Akter Priya

Lack of coverage can happen for several reasons, from financial limitations to failure in acquiring broadcasting license in time to a matter of prioritising over other ongoing events. Back then, the Bangladesh men's cricket team – the most popular team in the country by a landslide – had finished their Asia Cup assignment and so one would like to believe that, in that time, the latter was not the case.

While the ongoing trend in the country's overall news media lingers, of springing into action whenever success arrives in women's sports but lacking its anticipation and the follow-up, there remains a grave concern to whether the ongoing evolution of women's sports in Bangladesh is set for a U-turn in the foreseeable future.

Our women's SAFF success did not arrive as a fluke rather it was well in the making. The golden generation of girls – the likes of Monica Chakma, Maria Manda, Sanjida Akhtar, Rupna Chakma, Rituporna Chakma -- lived up to their reputation and had sealed the SAFF U-19 Women's Championship title in 2021. In line with the global trend that defied the predictions regarding how Covid-19 pandemic was going to flatten the curve of public interest towards women's game, it was pleasantly surprising to witness how enthusiastic were the home crowd that had arrived in numbers, amounting to around fifteen thousand, at the at the Birshreshtha Shaheed Mostafa Kamal Stadium in Kamalapur, Dhaka.

Filled with those aforementioned players who had shown that they are comfortable in thriving under pressure at the big stage, the possibility of the senior team to bag a maiden SAFF title was not far-fetched by any means, and so the broadcasting and advertising, or lack thereof, during and in building up to the tournament had left a lot to be desired.

As far as the positive developments are concerned in terms of exposure, the reception given to the victorious women footballers as they paraded the streets of Dhaka on an open-top bus, from Dhaka airport to BFF headquarters, was unprecedented. Moreover, its impact in promoting women's football, and sports in general, in raising awareness and acceptance among the general population can go a long way in time.

However, the open-top bus parade event could still be treated as a glaring exception to the norm following our success at the international stage brought by women. Another refreshing anomaly recently surfaced on the advertisement front as the Apex Footwear television commercial that starred Jamal Bhuiyan had featured two teenage girls playing football with Bangladesh men's national football team captain on the streets. The makers of that TVC had cashed in on the SAFF success and timed the release to perfection, on the eve of the men's football World Cup in November last year. A month prior, also commendable was how popular local film director Raihan Rafi managed to set the narrative of his ""Damal"" movie revolve around a group of Bangladesh's female footballers as they derived inspiration from the legendary Shadhin Bangla Football Team that had played a pivotal part during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.

It is quite natural that the followers of a title-winning team find it agonisingly hard to wait to see their side back in action, like how the fans of Argentina men's team eagerly await the Albiceleste's first international match against Panama this month since becoming the world champions in Qatar in December last year. And although the Bangladesh women's senior team is yet to take the field in an international match since SAFF win as they gear up to take part in the Women's Olympic Qualifiers from Asia early next month, but, in between, at least the recent edition of the Women's Football League -- featuring the SAFF winners and others -- was streamed live on BFF's YouTube channel. Now, isn't that the beauty of low expectations!",2023-03-10 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/the-need-proper-exposure-herstory-3268161,2023-05-18 10:29:20,thedailystar
515,‘Encouragement is key’,"While women have long been making remarkable strides in the world of sports, it is only recently that we have even come to learn some of the big players’ names. We know the likes of amazing cricketers like Salma Khatun and captain Nigar Sultana Joty, young bloods like Marufa Akhter and Afia Prottasha, and footballing queens like Sabina Khatun, Sanjida Akhter or Krishna Rani Sarkar and Maria Manda, but how well do we know our badminton, tennis or even basketball players? Is it the authorities who are not investing in women enough? Is promotion the bigger issue? Or is it the society’s lacking in accepting women in sports in all their glory?

In conversation with Ashreen Mridha, founder of Deshi Ballers and former shooting guard of the national women's basketball team, Naziba Basher of The Daily Star delves into some of the deeper questions of why the women are still made to lag behind.

The Daily Star (DS): What do you think are the biggest challenges sports women face in Bangladesh right now?

Ashreen Mridha (AM): Firstly, the obstacle comes from family and society as a whole. In many households, sports for women is still considered recreational, not professional. We get some encouragement when it comes to school sports, but beyond that, there is almost none. While families may give importance to their sons in sports, they focus on academics when it comes to their daughters. The basic need for having an active life is somehow not required for girls.

Then there are institutional challenges. If you look at the boards, those who make the decisions at the table – there is no female representation and that is where the problem of unequal wages arises.

As a matter of fact, the topmost authorities have stamped an age-limit for women in sports: 25, which makes no sense at all. Why should they stop playing if they are fit to play? No one really asks when Shakib Al Hasan will be retiring, right? Other institution-based discriminations, even from the ministerial-level, come when the woman is married or has children. We don't even have facilities to help women come back to their sport after a maternity leave.

There also needs to be substantial brand endorsements. More corporate brands, media houses and publications need to come forward and actively push to get sportswomen as brand ambassadors. That is when the funding will come and the mass media will turn their focus to women in sports – that will bring our audiences to the galleries as well.

DS: What about the difference between men's basketball and women's basketball?

AM: At the federation level, there is a huge gap. I had been playing for the national basketball team for a decade, and what I have seen first-hand is the bias in terms of facilities. The federation makes us feel like we don't deserve these facilities because of poor performances in comparison to the men, but where will the good performance come from with poor facilities and no grooming?

DS: How do you suggest we can bring in more girls into basketball?

AM: Basketball isn't as underrated as it used to be. But it is still considered an elite sport due to its infrastructural demand, so it becomes inaccessible at the grassroots. We also need accessible facilities to increase girl's participation. Encouragement is key!

DS: What are your suggestions for authorities to popularise women's sports in the country more?

AM: It is the era of social media and we need to use that to its fullest potential. But I must say, the female athletes themselves also have a lot to do. I think many times, us girls get embarrassed to self-promote. We need to talk about our achievements and struggles, not just our trophies.",2023-03-10 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/encouragement-key-3268156,2023-05-18 10:29:21,thedailystar
516,‘It cannot go on like this anymore’,"In her field, Bangladesh's table tennis icon Zobera Rahman Linu remained a cut above the rest during her stellar 24-year playing career between 1977 to 2001, having bagged a whopping 16 national titles from 1977 to 2001. However, her trajectory from being a celebrated sportsperson to being a woman in power has not manifested as predicted. The chairperson of the Bangladesh Olympic Association's (BOA) athlete commission spoke with Sabbir Hossain of The Daily Star in an exclusive interview, where the Guinness Record-holder addressed the issues that have been hindering the evolution of the women's game in the country. The excerpts of the interview are as follows:

The Daily Star (DS): Having been associated with sports for almost 50 years, do you think the number of women arriving into sports in Bangladesh have met expectations?

Zobera Rahman Linu (ZRL): Women are participating increasingly in cricket, football and other outdoor sports, which was inconceivable just 15 years ago. Still, although the situation has improved in comparison, women are not flocking to sports as expected.

Financial security is the key to freedom as the majority of female athletes come from lower middle-class families. If we can assure financial security, women from upper-class families will swarm into sports as well.

As the circumstances do not provide the needed economic self-sufficiency, the desired number of women from well-to-do families are not coming here. Therefore, even after so many years since Bangladesh's independence, women have not come forward to the extent they were supposed to.

DS: How do you think the public attention can be increased so that women's sports garner a greater exposure?

ZRL: People will know more about female athletes when there are tournaments, so tournaments should be held more frequently. It often happens that women sportspeople remain idle for months on end.

Moreover, when we open the newspaper, we only see the news of cricket. This mentality of only promoting cricket should be changed. We should ensure publicity for other sporting events too.

DS: As one of the country's sporting legends, you have observed how the administration operates to a large extent. Could you tell us what has been your realisation in recent times?

ZRL: Dirty politics and discord among members can be seen within numerous federations. Also, many organisers do not have a positive relationship with athletes.

The country has 52 sports federations and associations, but what is the percentage of women in various positions? There are no women in positions of power. They are denied the opportunity, and it has even been said that 'women cannot' [when it comes to operating at top positions in federations].

I was the [Bangladesh] Table Tennis Federation's (BTTF) general secretary for just a few months before being forced out by a hastily scheduled election. There was a plot against me. Also, I was a member of the [Bangladesh] Cycling Federation (BCF) but its election was held without my knowledge. It cannot go on like this anymore.",2023-03-10 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/it-cannot-go-anymore-3268151,2023-05-18 10:29:22,thedailystar
517,Those turbulent first days of ‘71 March,"It was a tumultuous month when the inception of a new nation was taking shape, changing the course of the subcontinent's history forever. In March 1971, Bangladesh's masses joined the nation's final struggle for freedom. In the first week of the month, it became apparent that Bangladesh would emerge as an independent nation. However, questions remained as to how and when it would happen.

On March 1, General Yahya Khan suddenly postponed the national assembly session that was scheduled to take place on March 3.

About a month earlier, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, chairman of Pakistan People's Party (PPP), had a meeting with Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, president of Awami League (January 27-28), where Bangabandhu demanded to formulate the state ordinance -- based on the historic six-point demand -- within February 15.

However, Bhutto wanted to continue the discussions and negotiations further. Against this backdrop, Yahya announced March 3 as the date of the national assembly session when the power would be handed over to Bangabandhu's democratically elected government.

Things changed when on February 15, Bhutto declared that PPP cannot participate in the assembly unless Awami League compromises on its six-point demand. When Yahya asked him about the next course of action on February 19, Bhutto clearly stated, ""If Mujib does not comply with our conditions, it will not be possible for us to join the assembly.""

When President Yahya Khan postponed the assembly indefinitely, agitated masses of the then East Pakistan took to the streets of Dhaka. All shops, businesses and offices were shut down. At that time a cricket match of BCCP was taking place at Dhaka stadium. Agitated audience stopped the match and protested the decision. All of a sudden, Dhaka became a city of protests, procession and demonstration -- the air of which had been looming over the city for months. Even government officials participated in those processions.

Political leaders expressed their disappointment over the announcement and stated that the decision was completely against the people's mandate. It was taken to sabotage the process of transferring the power to the elected representatives of the country's citizens.

At one point, a mass procession reached Hotel Purbani at Motijheel, where members of Awami League's parliamentary committee were writing the draft ordinance based on the six-point demand.

During a press conference after the meeting, AL President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman harshly criticised Yahya's decision and said the assembly session was postponed just to appease a certain party. ""We cannot accept this. The democratic process has almost been foiled by this decision,"" he said.

On March 3, a huge mass gathering was organised by the student leaders of all parties at Paltan Maidan.

He went on to say the people of Bengal have refused this Yahya's decision. Mujib declared an all-out shutdown on March 2 in Dhaka and a half-day (till 2:00pm) shutdown in the entire East Pakistan on March 3. He also announced that a mass gathering will be held on March 7 at the Racecourse Maidan, where he will declare the next course of action.

On March 1, Bangabandhu sent a delegation to discuss the matters with Maulana Bhashani. That night, political leaders met Bangabandhu at his Dhanmondi residence. Meanwhile, Abdul Qayyum Khan, leader of Pakistan Muslim League (Qayyum), declared his support for Yahya's decision of postponing the assembly. In protest of this support, Khan A Sabur, general secretary of the party, announced his resignation from the party.

On that very night, Yahya appointed Lieutenant General Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, the then martial law administrator of zone B, as the governor of East Pakistan.

In the later hours of the night, Yaqub banned the publication or broadcasting of any news, opinion and photographs that are directly or indirectly against the ""interest and sovereignty"" of Pakistan according to the Martial Law Ordinance 110. According to the law, any individual alleged of violating this order could be served with a maximum of 10 years of imprisonment with hard labour.

Amid such a situation, students of all parties organised a demonstration in front of the arts building at Dhaka University. At 11:00am on March 2, while ASM Abdur Rob, the then vice president of Dhaka University Central Students' Union (Ducsu), was speaking at the demonstration, Sheikh Zahid Hossain, a leader of Chhatra League (BCL), brought a flagpole and Rob hoisted the first flag of Bangladesh.

Abdul Kuddus Makhon, Tofail Ahmed and Nur-e-Alam Siddique accompanied Rob at the gathering.

Many popular student leaders such as Makhon and Shahjahan Siraj delivered speeches at the demonstration where they proposed that Bangabandhu read out the manifesto for independence during the upcoming mass gathering on March 7. The student leaders pledged to continue their struggle until achieving independence and autonomy. They brought out a massive procession from Dhaka University that ended at Baitul Mukarram mosque.

On the same day, National Awami Party (NAP) and Jatiya League organised two demonstrations around 11:00am at Central Shaheed Minar and around 3:00pm at Baitul Mukarram respectively. After the demonstrations, protestors tried to form a procession, when police fired at the crowd and three students of Tejgaon Polytechnic School -- Aziz, Morshed and Mamun -- were killed. Around 50 others were wounded.

Although Bangabandhu called for a strike at Dhaka on March 2, the strike was observed all over the country. Most of the major streets were controlled by the army at that time. On that night, the newly appointed governor of East Pakistan declared a curfew. Bangabandhu vehemently opposed the announcement and called for a nationwide strike on March 3-6.

At one stage, students and the people broke the curfew and brought out processions all over the country. They installed barricades in every major street of the city. When a procession was heading to the governor's residence around 9:00pm, the army fired at the procession at the DIT intersection in front of the office of the Morning News newspaper.

On March 3, a half-day strike was observed all over the country and a huge mass gathering was organised by the student leaders of all parties at Paltan Maidan. The gathering was chaired by the then BCL president Nur-e-Alam Siddique.

Shahjahan Siraj read out the manifesto for independence in presence of Bangabandhu in front of the crowd. At that time, Bangabandhu was declared the supreme leader of free and independent Bangladesh. Paltan Maidan was bursting with crowds and their slogans. Bangabandhu called for a non-cooperation movement from that gathering.

""We shall continue our fight until we achieve the people's demand for autonomy. The struggle for freedom must not stop even if I'm not here. Even if I die, 70 million people must see a truly independent Bangladesh,"" declared the supreme leader.

During that gathering, ASM Abdur Rob, the then VP of Ducsu; then general secretary Abdul Kuddus Makhon and then BCL president Nur-e-Alam Siddique and then general secretary Shahjahan Siraj pledged to commence the fight for independence.",2023-03-03 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/those-turbulent-first-days-71-march-3262536,2023-05-18 10:29:24,thedailystar
518,Key stages of war,"FULL-SCALE INVASION

At dawn on February 24, 2022, after repeatedly denying plans to invade Ukraine, Putin announces a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" the former Soviet country. The West imposes unprecedented sanctions on Russia and progressively ramps them up. The European Union agrees to send weapons to Ukraine -- a first for the bloc -- and the United States greenlights billions of dollars in military aid. Russian forces make rapid gains on Ukraine's south coast, seizing the Black Sea port of Kherson, close to the Russian-occupied Crimea peninsula, and the port of Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov. Moscow's troops also attempt to encircle Kyiv.

HORROR IN BUCHA

A month into the fighting, having failed to break through to Kyiv, the Russian army withdraws from northern Ukraine to focus on the east and south. On April 2, AFP discovers the bodies of at least 20 civilians, some with their hands tied behind their backs, lying on a single street in the northwestern Kyiv suburb of Bucha. Over the following weeks, hundreds more bodies, many bearing signs of torture, are found in homes, cellars and shallow graves across the north. Russia is accused of widespread war crimes, which it denies.

THE BATTLE FOR MARIUPOL

On April 21, Russia claims to have taken the southeastern port city of Mariupol, which has been relentlessly bombarded since the start of the war and subjected to a brutal siege. In capturing the city, Russia aims to link up rebel-held territory in the Donbas with the occupied Crimea peninsula to the south. Around 2,000 Ukrainian fighters hold out for nearly a month in the city's sprawling Azovstal steelworks before being ordered in May by Kyiv to surrender to the Russians to save their lives. According to the Ukrainian government, 90 percent of Mariupol has been razed in the war and at least 20,000 people killed.

UKRAINE FIGHTS BACK

Over the summer, the United States and EU step up their supplies of heavy weapons to Kyiv, allowing it to stage a two-pronged fightback. In the south, Ukrainian forces launch a major offensive to retake Kherson in late August. They follow up in early September with a lightning counter-offensive around Kharkiv in the northeast, winning back hundreds of towns and villages. With his army losing ground, Putin announces a call-up of some 300,000 reservists. Days later he formally annexes four regions of Ukraine -- Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia -- after staging local referendums on joining Russia that are dismissed by Kyiv and the West as a sham. On November 9, Russia's forces suffer their greatest setback in the war when they are forced to abandon Kherson.

DARKEST WINTER

In October, Russia changes tack and turns its sights to Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which it targets with repeated barrages of missile and drone strikes.

519,War in numbers,"Military losses

According to the latest estimates from Norway, 180,000 Russian soldiers and 100,000 Ukrainian troops have been wounded or killed in the conflict. Other Western sources estimate the war has caused 150,000 casualties on each side. In comparison, some 15,000 Soviet soldiers were killed in a whole decade of fighting in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. Ukrainian soldiers often use the term ""cannon fodder"" to describe the Russians sent to their death along the front line.

War crimes

UN investigators have accused Russia of committing war crimes on a ""massive scale"" in Ukraine -- bombings, executions, torture and horrific sexual violence. Around 65,000 suspected war crimes have been reported throughout the war, the European Union's justice commissioner Didier Reynders said. Kyiv alleges Moscow has forcibly deported more than 16,000 children to Russia or areas controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. Several NGOs have condemned Ukraine, meanwhile, for violating the rights of Russian prisoners of war, but on a much smaller scale. The International Criminal Court launched an investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity last year.

Civilian losses

Kyiv said at least 20,000 Ukrainian civilians had been killed. In total, some 30,000 to 40,000 civilians have lost their lives nationwide in the conflict, Western sources say. The United Nations estimates that 21,000 civilians have been killed or wounded in the fighting, but said the real figure was likely much higher. Ukrainian authorities say at least 400 children have been killed. Landmines will also be a huge threat to civilians. Kyiv says 30 percent of Ukrainian territory has been contaminated. Experts warn demining could take decades.

1,500-km front line

The ""active"" front line runs north to south along 1,500 kilometres (900 miles) of territory, according to Valery Zaluzhny, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces. Moscow's troops occupy almost a fifth of Ukraine, according to figures from the US-based Institute for the Study of War. But Zaluzhny said Ukrainian forces had managed to wrest back some 40 percent of territory occupied after the invasion last year.

Western military aid

The West was initially reluctant to become too involved, in order to avoid any more direct confrontation between it and nuclear-armed Russia, but little by little it has acceded to most demands. By November, Kyiv's allies had pledged more than 37 billion euros ($40 billion) in military aid, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. That figure does not include the latest announcements in January that the US, Canada and several European countries will send Ukraine modern battle tanks. But President Volodymyr Zelensky's request for F-16 fighter jets has so far gone unmet.

Battered economy

The World Bank in October said it expected Ukraine's economy to contract by 35 percent in 2022. The Kyiv School of Economics in January estimated it would cost $138 billion to replace all the infrastructure ravaged by war. In a country famed for its cereal and sunflower oil exports, the war has caused more than $34 billion in economic losses in the agricultural sector, it said in November. Some 3,000 schools have been affected by the fighting, the Ukrainian government said, as well as 239 cultural sites, according to the UN cultural fund. Rebuilding Ukraine following the invasion would cost an estimated $349 billion, a joint assessment by the Ukrainian government, the European Commission and the World Bank found in September.

Millions of refugees

More than eight million Ukrainians have been forced to flee Ukraine since the war broke out, the UN refugee agency said, the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. Neighbouring Poland hosts the largest share of these refugees, with more than 1.5 million of them. More than five million people have been displaced inside the country. Moscow said another five million people had sought refuge in Russia.",2023-02-24 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/war-numbers-3256691,2023-05-18 10:29:26,thedailystar
520,A village of mosques,"Beraid is a small place in terms of size, but it is huge in terms of popularity, thanks to a large number of ancient mosques.

Though this village is situated in a remote area, seven miles away from North Badda in the capital, it is popularly known as the ""village of mosques"".

Most of the mosques in the village were built during the Sultanate, Mughal, British and Pakistani periods, according to elderly locals.

The village now has a total of 15 mosques. Surprisingly, seven of the mosques were built before 1900, making this village popular, to the point that it was dubbed ""Mosjider Gram"" by locals.

Among others, Morolpara Jame Masjid was built in 1833, Purbopara Jame Masjid in 1893, Agarpara and Chotkipara Jame Masjid in 1893, Askartek Jame Masjid in 1888, Chinadipara Jame Masjid in 1893 and Aroiddopara Jame Masjid in 1896.

Apart from these six ancient mosques, Bhuiyapara Jame Masjid, also the central mosque of the village, is the oldest among all. Though there are differing opinions on the mosque's age, some claim it is 200 years old, while others say it is 400 years old.

However, most people think that the mosque was built during the Sultanate period. This mosque is architecturally similar to the Baba Saleh Mosque in Sonargaon.

A nameplate in front of the mosque reads: ""Bhuiyapara Jame Masjid mosque was established in 1505, although there are conflicting opinions regarding the authenticity of this information.""

According to a booklet named ""Mosjider Gram Beraid"", published by Beraid Public Library, the mosque stood 17 feet 6 inches tall, while the interior was measured 16 feet by 16 feet.

In 1906, the authorities expanded the mosque areas for the first time. Later it was renovated several times, as mentioned in the book.

At present, the total length of the mosque's interior is 52 feet in the north-south and 33 feet in the east-west. The balcony spans 52 feet and is 44 feet wide. The mosque now has a total area of 9,221 square feet.

Md Iqbal, a 70-year-old resident of Beraid, was found chatting with some of his old friends on the premises.

He said, ""A long time ago, people knew our village as 'Mosjider Gram'. There are so many old mosques in our village like this one.""

The mosque committee's President Haji Belayet Hossain Bhuiyan said people often come from far and wide to see the mosque. The Department of Archeology preserved the original part of the mosque, he said.",2023-02-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/village-mosques-3250881,2023-05-18 10:29:28,thedailystar
521,Cultivating reading habits since 2001,"At first glance, it looks like a simple tin-shed house. One will not even find any decent-looking furniture inside the room. But this tiny and simple room is the lighthouse for the people of Beraid, formally known as Beraid village, situated seven miles away from North Badda in Dhaka.

The place is called Beraid Gonopathagar, a library established in 2001.

When readers enter the library, they will notice the words of Henrik Ibsen, Vincent Starrett, and other thinkers hanging on the walls. Around 3,700 books are housed in the library, including histories of the Liberation War, novels, stories, short stories, essays, poetry, plays, children's literature, and many more.

Over 50 people, the majority of whom are youths, visit the library every day.

""Anyone can read books here, and they can also borrow books to read at home,"" said senior librarian Sirajul Islam Bhuiyan.

The library remains open from 9:00am to 8:00pm, seven days a week, he added.

These correspondents met Jannat Hossen at the library, who came to return a book on rhymes.

The five-year-old said reading books has become a hobby for her since she began visiting this library near her home. ""I like to read books of rhymes and short stories the most,"" she added.

""My sister and I come to this library regularly and read our favourite books.""

Apart from books, some daily newspapers were also seen hung in a corner of the library for its readers.

Emdad Hossain Bhuiyan, a journalist by profession and the man behind this initiative, said, ""This library is not a profitable organisation. But the maintenance cost is on the rise as we have to buy new books every year.""

""We have to spend around Tk 2 lakh per annum to run this library, "" he added.",2023-02-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/cultivating-reading-habits-2001-3250911,2023-05-18 10:29:29,thedailystar
522,Where basic amenities remain elusive,"Residents of the newly-added wards in Dhaka North City Corporation expressed dissatisfaction after being denied civic amenities, claiming that life was far better when they were under the union parishad.

During a recent visit to several wards in zone 10 (wards: 37, 38, 41, and 42), The Daily Star correspondents found that the reality falls far short of expectations when it comes to major issues that people face in their communities.

Although high-rises have mushroomed in these areas, basic facilities -- better roads, streetlights, electricity, gas, and proper waste management -- remain elusive for its residents.

NO GAS FOR 4 MONTHS

""It has been four months since the gas supply was suspended in our line. But we still have to continue paying just for subscribing to the service,"" said Saiful Islam, a resident of Satarkul area in ward 41.

""We have been urging the company as well as the councillor to solve the crisis but they continue to turn a blind eye. So we have to buy gas cylinders, which costs us extra money,"" he added.

After failing to disconnect some illegal connections, the authorities suspended the gas supply of the entire line, he added.

Talking to the Daily Star, residents of Pukurpara, Taltola, and Merulkhola under ward 41, and different areas, including Beraid under ward-42, shared a similar experience.

""We were better off under Union Parishad,"" said another resident, Forhad Hossain.

""We thought we would finally see the light of development when our area came under DNCC five years ago. But becoming a part of the city corporation has only brought sufferings to us,"" he added.

UNDER THE WATER, THERE WERE CROPLANDS

While visiting the Pukurpara area under Satarkul, these correspondents found an empty boat, waiting at the bank of what seemed a ""waterbody"".

But after a few minutes, a man approaching the boat proved these correspondents wrong saying, ""Once I used to cultivate crops here. But the entire place went underwater, thanks to unplanned development.""

Mujibur Rahman, who was formerly a farmer, said, ""Tall buildings were being built around our croplands, which ended up blocking the regular flow of water. As a result, our lands submerged during monsoon and turned into such water bodies.""

""Is this what development costs?"" he asked.

While visiting Moynartek area under ward-38, Md Ridoy, a young rickshaw-puller, said, ""You are lucky that you did not come here during monsoon. You would not even see these roads, as they remain underwater for most of that time.""

Iqbal Hossain, a resident of Beraid, echoed the same. ""As there is no proper drainage system in this area, it goes under knee-deep water after only half an hour of rain.""

NARROW ROADS, NO STREETLIGHTS

Apart from Satarkul's main road, most of the roads are in a dilapidated state. These roads are so narrow that only two small vehicles can move through them at a time.

Mohammad Abdullah, 70, a resident of Beraid, said, ""The roads were made when we were under the union parishad. They have not been repaired even after five years of being a part of the city corporation.""

While talking about the streets, a youth showed some newly-installed streetlights with electricity poles. However, residents still have to depend on outdoor lamps while walking on streets at night, as those are still not functional, he said.

NO WASTE MANAGEMENT MECHANISM

In absence of a proper waste management system, many people dump household wastes into nearby canals or wherever they can. The roads remain dirty with garbage, as the authorities do not take any measures to clean them.

Farhad Hossain of Pukurpara area (ward 41) said, ""We collected funds from locals to repair the old sewerage line and clean the streets. But all these are responsibilities of the city authorities. What are they doing?""

""Waste and accumulated rainwater have also become a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes,"" he added.

THE DARK SIDE

Drug abuse has become a major issue in these areas, as a large number of youths in the neighbourhood are addicted to narcotics, according to locals. But councillors do not take the initiatives to solve this social crisis, said Kabir Hossain, a resident.

While talking to The Daily Star, Shafiqul Islam, a former councillor of ward 41, said, ""As the first elected councillor, I tried to enrich civic facilities. The gas supply was normal during my tenure but residents now have been suffering from disrupted gas service.""

He said two roads were also constructed during his time, which remain as the last bricks installed on these roads to date.

On drug addiction, he said, ""I managed to improve the situation, which is again worsening.""

THE AUTHORITIES' TAKE

Contacted, the current councillor of ward 41 Abdul Matin admitted that the condition of his ward is the same as it was under the union parishad, if not worse.

""I fear facing the people of my area and avoid social gatherings as I know I have not fulfilled most of my promises to them,"" he said.

""Gas supply will resume soon. We will adjust bills for those who have been paying without getting the service,"" he claimed.

He blamed budget constraints as the reason behind the current situation in the area.

Ward 42 Councillor Ayub Anshar Mintu also pointed out the scarcity of budget. ""We only got around Tk 17 crore as budget last year. We are trying to improve the facilities using this low allocation,"" he said.

""We have been working on constructing a new road, installing streetlights and some other development works, which will be visible soon,"" he added.

523,Dhaka’s uninspiring govt primary schools,"Why isn’t the Delhi model-inspired project to reform primary education having any impact?

According to some guardians and teachers, most of these schools are fraught with numerous problems -- including the absence of a proper learning environment, long, tedious school hours, lack of safety, and poor infrastructure -- which has led to fewer children getting admitted. Photo: Prabir Das

The government aims to build a ""Smart Bangladesh"" by 2041, but without fixing our faulty public education system, how far can it achieve this goal? The human resources for Bangladesh's future are being short-changed at the primary education level, finds The Daily Star through visits to several schools right in the heart of the capital.

Around 12:30am on a school day last week, when classrooms in most of the private schools in Dhanmondi were abuzz with lessons, the scenario at Dhanmondi-1 Government Primary School was starkly the opposite.

A teacher was busy sewing something in an almost-empty classroom of fifth-graders. Four students, apparently hungry and exhausted, were sleeping on a bench with books piled on it. A few of their peers were playing in the school playground.

The classroom of the fourth grade had neither any teacher nor student. The teachers declared a day-off, as most of the students did not turn up that day, which, according to the school teachers, is quite common.

In 2019, govt allocated Tk 1,159cr to modernise 342 schools and construct 11 new primary schools in Dhaka in 2019 under Drishti-nandan Project Number of schools so far modernised, constructed under the project in Dhaka: 0

""Most of the students do not come to the school regularly. So, teachers have nothing to do, and spend the time doing their personal stuff,"" said a senior teacher of the school, preferring not to be named.

This is one of many age-old problems plaguing the 342 government-run primary schools in Dhaka, where more than 2,00,000 children are enrolled. All these schools offer free education, while many institutions are staffed by a sufficient number of well-trained teachers. But the quality of education leaves much to be desired.

According to some guardians and teachers, most of these schools are fraught with numerous problems -- including the absence of a proper learning environment, long, tedious school hours, lack of safety, and poor infrastructure -- which has led to fewer children getting admitted. Currently, only the urban poor bother to get their children admitted to these institutions.

In contrast to the failing primary schools of Dhaka, in Delhi, primary schools are going through a remarkable transformation. Led by Aam Admi Party Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, schools are being revitalised under an innovative reform scheme.

Since 2015, the Indian authorities invested heavily and brought certain structural reforms to overhaul the government-school education system, which is accessed by the poorest of the poor, in a city of nearly two crore people.

The massive overhaul has brought about impressive results and is now attracting children from middle-class families, who want their wards to get the quality education these schools are offering.

Inspired by the initiative, the Bangladesh government took up a project named ""Drishtinandan Prakalpa"" in 2019, with the view to creating a modern and child-friendly learning environment in the state-run primary schools of the capital.

But the project is going nowhere, and the state of these schools remain unchanged.

THE SORRY STATE OF DHAKA'S PRIMARY SCHOOLS

Both teachers and parents have complained that both the infrastructure and environment in general are not conducive to learning in these schools.

This correspondent visited eight state-run primary schools in the capital and found their complaints to be true. Six of the schools were housed in different types of government offices and institutions; one was inside an evening law college.

A primary school in Gulshan houses an education office. The headmaster of the school complained that the officials of the office do not allow the school to arrange co-curricular activities in the school premises, as they ""feel disturbed"" by children playing.

""Visitors also frequent this office, and we cannot prohibit them from entering the premises during school hours, which is also a concern with regard to our children's safety,"" he said.

The Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) does not appoint any security guard or support staff for these institutions. Gates of the primary schools this correspondent visited were found open and unguarded.

Street vendors can freely enter the school premises and use school toilets without any permission. Local youths use the school playground to play cricket, football and just hang out, which makes the playground inaccessible to school students. Besides, the toilets are quite filthy.

According to the headteachers, every primary school receives an allowance of Tk 70,000 to Tk 100,000 per year, depending on the number of students, from the government's School Level Improvement Plan (SLIP) Fund. An institution bears the entire maintenance cost for a year with the money.

The principal of a school in Mirpur said, ""I get Tk 85,000 for one year to run my school. With this money, we can just purchase some essential stationery, teaching aids, and arrange cultural activities. Recruiting a cleaner is out of the budget. We have no other alternative but to leave our schools unguarded and premises unclean.""

""With such poor maintenance and funding, we cannot expect well-off families to send their kids to our schools,"" she commented.

LONG, TEDIOUS SCHOOL HOURS

Teachers and parents identified long school hours as significantly affecting the learning environment of these schools.

The pre-primary section starts at 8:00am and ends at 11:00am. However, the school timing for the students of grade three, four, and five is from 9:00am to 3:00pm. The duration of each class is 50 minutes.

""All of our students come from poor families. Their parents cannot give them tiffin regularly. But we cannot run a canteen in our school premises. As a result, students get exhausted, especially after 12:00pm, and it becomes impossible to keep them attentive in the classroom,"" said a teacher of a primary school in Badda.

Mosammat Bilkis, a house-help working at different apartments of Kalabagan, said she is now thinking of taking out her two children from a government primary school in the neighbourhood.

""One of my kids studies in first grade and another in third. I go to work after dropping off my younger child to school at 8:00am. I have to pick him up from the school at 11:00am, and again go to school at 3:00pm to pick up my other son. It's too difficult,"" she said.

""I can't afford to come to school every day. So, I'm thinking of transferring my children to a single shift school,"" Bilkis added.

Teachers do not enrol their children in the very school they work at because of the poor educational environment and quality.

""We get children from families that are not aware of their children's academic achievements. The children do not get any academic care from their parents at home. Neither can they afford to hire private tutors. So, the kids' learning does not become sustainable, and they don't perform well in the exams,"" she said.

ANY LESSON LEARNT FROM DELHI SCHOOLS?

The Delhi government invested Rs 769 billion on its 1,037 schools. Modernisation of infrastructure, incorporating vocational and ICT skills into the curriculum, recruiting qualified, trained teachers, and forming school-managing committees are some of the major reforms recently brought about by the Kejriwal government.

But the Bangladesh government's ""Drishtinandan Prakalpa"" project made little to no impact.

Under the Tk 1,159-crore project, 342 schools of Dhaka city were supposed to go through major infrastructural reform, and teachers were to be given thorough training on vocational and ICT skills.

At least 11 new primary schools, three in Uttara and eight in Purbachal, were supposed to be constructed under this project.

The project deadline is 2025.

However, not a single school has been renovated or constructed yet, and promises of quality training for teachers and modern academic environment exist only on paper.

Project Director Mizanur Rahman said, ""Yes, our progress is very slow. From 2019 to 2021, project directors have been changed several times, and all of them, including me, have to look after this project as an additional duty. As a result, my previous PDs could not pay much attention here.""

Mizanur, who took charge last year, said he sped up the process of land acquisition and property valuation.

""We faced many challenges while getting land allotment for the new schools. We are assessing which schools need what type of renovation. However, we have to rely on LGED for all the engineering work, which is also one of the major reasons behind the delay. If we had a dedicated engineering cell, such delays could have been avoided,"" commented Mizanur, also a joint secretary of DPE.

""Once the project is completed, you will not hear about any such problem. All the schools under this project will be transformed to single-shift schools, so students and teachers will not have to spend a long time in the school anymore,"" he added.

However, he could not confirm when the project will end.

Experts suggest recruiting quality teachers and training them properly to improve the situation.

Mohammad Mojibur Rahman, associate professor of Institute of Education and Research at Dhaka University, emphasised on connecting the local community with the school.

""Like the schools in Delhi, we should engage school-management committees to manage funding for schools and to ensure accountability in the institutions. As schools here are run entirely by the government, and teachers are treated as government employees, accountability in institutional operation automatically decreases.""

He said transparency in teacher recruitment and proper training have to be ensured.

""We have lengthened the school hours in primary schools, but our teachers do not know how to arrange different types of learning activities to best utilise the time. As a result, class times have become extremely boring.""

""Pre-service and in-service training must be arranged for primary school teachers to make class time effective and enjoyable,"" Mojibur stated.",2023-02-10 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/dhakas-uninspiring-govt-primary-schools-3244616,2023-05-18 10:29:32,thedailystar
524,Watching planes their only entertainment,"With a smiling face and curiosity in her eyes, six-year-old Anika stood beside a barbed wire fence and gazed up at the sky. Soon, an aeroplane took off with a loud roar.

A few minutes later, another plane touched down the long, grey runway surrounded by a wide carpet of green grass, causing the little girl to clap in delight.

This is a regular scene for residents of Dolipara area in Uttara, adjacent to the runway of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport.

It is one of the few means of entertainment for the children as well as for other residents of Dolipara under zone-6 of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC). They flock to the area, keeping their eyes at the sky, just to see the planes fly.

In a recent visit, these correspondents found that there is no playground, or any other open space for the children in the locality. So, the residents have chosen the runway for their leisure activity.

People were seen standing close to the fence, maybe just out of a sense of curiosity, or imagining what it might be like to fly in the sky in a blink of an eye. Many were busy taking photographs and videos.

The sky becomes more interesting every day in the afternoon for the visitors, as most of the flights either take off or land during that time, they said.

Rows of large planes can be seen in the distance, including those of Bangladesh Biman, Emirates, Saudi Airlines and Turkish Airlines. People from different parts of Dhaka also visit Dolipara runway on weekends as well as on different holidays.

Masudur Rahman, Anika's father, said, ""My daughter doesn't have any place to play. So, I brought her here today to have a quality time...""

Another visitor, Jui Mandal, said, ""I've been living in Uttara sector-12 for seven years. There is no open space to spend an evening with your family... So, whenever I get a chance, I come here with my kids.""

The place also provides a good opportunity for hawkers to earn some money.

Md Liton, a vendor, said, ""Almost 300 to 400 people usually come here to see the planes every day.""",2023-02-03 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/watching-planes-their-only-entertainment-3238456,2023-05-18 10:29:33,thedailystar
525,"A village of crabs, in Dhaka!","It was early morning. The sun had not yet risen, and most of Dhaka was still sleeping.

However, it was peak business hours for some residents in Uttara's Nalbhog area.

There was a kilometre-long line of parked trucks on both sides of the road. Small baskets full of crabs, which came from farms in different coastal regions of the country, were being unloaded from the trucks.

According to Bangladesh Live and Chilled Food Exporters Association (BLCFEA), Bangladesh exports more than 7,000 tonnes of crabs a year. Nalbhog area in Uttara is the place from where around 200 commercial companies operate their crab exporting business.

Previously, crab-packing factories were built in various parts of the capital. However, because the airport is close by, the majority of this industry's packing factories have been established in Nalbhog. As a result, it became known as the ""Village of Crabs (Kakrar Gram)"".

The exporters association has approximately 200 members, with 60-70 of them actively involved in the processing of crabs for export from the area.

After unloading the baskets, the workers clean the crabs by separating male crabs from the females, said Rafiqullah, member of a crab-exporting firm.

He explained that after weighing, they process the crabs, and pack them into plastic or cardboard boxes. Then they become ready for shipment, and are sent to various countries.

These correspondents found crab farmers coming from Khulna, Satkhira, Noakhali, Patuakhali, Chattogram and Cox's Bazar at the site.

According to Khairuddin Ahmed, chairman of BLCFEA, around 20 to 25 tonnes of crabs are exported from Bangladesh every day, amounting to more than 7,000 tonnes per year.

But Gazi Abul Hashem, a former chairman of the association, said, ""We suffered losses during the Covid period because there was an export ban.""

""I was forced to shut down my business,"" he added.

But the current chairman says the situation has improved now.

""As China has removed the ban on crabs imported from Bangladesh, around 15 to 20 companies have already gotten permission and started exporting crabs like before, "" he added.",2023-02-03 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/village-crabs-dhaka-3238506,2023-05-18 10:29:34,thedailystar
526,"Plight of DNCC wards 52, 53: Life seemed better under union parishad","In July 2017, Dhaka North City Corporation took 18 wards under its wing, which were previously under the union parishad system. It divided the newly added wards into 5 zones. While this move came with a promise of development for these wards, the reality after five years is way far from that. They remain as backward as they used to be, if not more. The Daily Star explored the plight of these neglected wards in a five-story series. Today we look into wards 52 and 53 under zone 6.

If anyone visits the capital's Uttara area, they will find some attractive wide roads, surrounded by high-rise buildings, like the ones we see in a modern city. Expensive cars and other vehicles regularly pass through these roads.

But just a few metres ahead, when they reach Ranabhola Bazar after crossing Sector-10, they will be astounded to see the same city in such a disarray.

Ranabhola Bazar, which was previously under Harirampur union, became a part of Dhaka North City Corporation in 2017, but is yet to see any development.

While visiting wards 52 and 53 (under zone 6), these correspondents were having trouble realising that these areas are part of the capital. Residents living in that area are completely deprived of civic amenities.

Shamim Hossain, a youth of Chondalvog area, said, ""Our standard of living is significantly lower than Uttara, though it's just a few kilometres away.""

ROADS IN RUINS

In a recent visit, these correspondents found that the roads in Baunia area under ward-52 were dilapidated, filled with numerous potholes.

The situation deteriorates during monsoon when the entire area goes under filthy, foul smelling water. The same scenario was found while visiting ward-53, which stretches from Dharangartek intersection to Nayanagar Chairman Bari Mor via Tetultola area. The road from Ranabhola Bottola to Nayanagar Chairman Bari Mor through Bamnartek also resembles the poor condition of the newly-added wards.

Bamnartek's roads are mostly made of earth. When it rains, the roads go in ruins, making it more difficult for vehicles to travel on them. According to residents, this increases the risk of accidents.

Patients who need to go to hospitals become the worst sufferers, they said.

Ayesha Siddiqa, a Bamnartek resident who is currently pregnant, stated that she recently fell from an auto-rickshaw and was severely injured while on her way to see a doctor. Many of the residents of the area shared similar ordeals.

POOR DRAINAGE, MOSQUITO MENACE

Locals alleged that due to absence of a proper drainage network and sewage system, roads often get muddy or submerged in knee-deep water even after a short spell of rain. Besides, as there is no designated garbage disposal area, waste spreads to different places during this time.

As a result, the localities become a breeding ground for mosquitoes, making residents vulnerable to dengue fever.

Abdul Mazid, a resident of Nalbhog area, said, ""Despite our initial high hopes, the situation has remained unchanged even five years after our area became a part of DNCC.""

""Elections come, we cast our votes, we see new councillors, but our conditions remain unchanged,"" he added.

SECURITY CONCERNS

Though a large number of residents live in these areas, there are no sufficient street lights along the roads. As a result, people are afraid to step outside after dark.

Residents of Badaldi, Uludaha, Chandura, Mandurah, Sholati, Dalipara, Ahalia, Pakuria and Balijuri areas shared similar experiences.

NO WATER SUPPLY

Residents of ward-53 also alleged that there is shortage of pure drinking water as Wasa does not provide services in their locality. So, they have no choice but to drink water from shallow tube-wells, which are mostly contaminated with iron. Often, people suffer from different waterborne diseases due to this.

Shamim Hossain, a youth of Chondalvog area, said, ""Our standard of living is significantly lower than Uttara, though it's just a few kilometres away.""

""What I can't fathom is that we used to have some sort of development activities in our localities when we were under the union parishad. Our condition worsened when we integrated with the city corporation, although it was supposed to improve,"" he added.

NO PLAYGROUND

Contrary to the tall claims of city authorities building a playground in every ward, there's not a single field or open space for children in wards 52 and 53.

Shariful Alam of Dolipara under ward-52, said, ""Buildings in this area are being constructed without any proper planning. As a result, it's eating up all the open spaces and playgrounds for our children.""

COUNCILLORS' TAKE

Contacted, councillors of the wards expressed frustration and said they are under pressure from people, as the constituencies did not see any development work since their inclusion under DNCC.

Md Farid Ahmed, councillor of ward-52, said, ""I have already constructed three new roads, and installed street lights in some areas, but could not continue further development projects, due to insufficient budget.""

Md Nasir Uddin, councillor of ward-53, said, ""I have already informed higher authorities to provide me with sufficient budget. We are hopeful to start developing new roads, along with drainage systems soon.""",2023-02-03 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/plight-dncc-wards-52-53-life-seemed-better-under-union-parishad-3238536,2023-05-18 10:29:35,thedailystar
527,Freedom of movement a basic right,"Says Adil Mohammed Khan on the issue of DNCC ward-2

""The main task of the DNCC is to ensure the road for the movement, but despite knowing the problems, they have not taken any initiative to address the issue.""

Adil Mohammed Khan, professor of urban & regional planning at Jahangirnagar University, said a lack of alternative roads is a direct result of unplanned urbanisation.

This has led to the construction of buildings, blocking transportation routes and creating a bottleneck.

""In the past, urban planning was done in such a way that it did not create any obstacles to people's movement. There was a mutual understanding and cooperation among people. But in modern urban planning, this seems to be lacking,"" he said.

Adil, also executive director of the Institute for Planning and Development, said, ""Freedom of movement is a basic right. It is the responsibility of the city authorities to ensure this freedom.""

The ward councillor should take initiatives so that residents' basic right to movement is not being violated.

""The authorities should prioritise the needs of all residents, including those from low-income backgrounds, and ensure that their rights are protected,"" he added.

Adil also highlighted the need for the city corporation to take immediate action to resolve this issue and provide alternative routes for locals.

""The main task of the DNCC is to ensure the road for the movement, but despite knowing the problems of the roads, they have not taken any initiative to address the issue,"" he said.

He also mentioned that the lack of proper infrastructure and transportation planning leads to increased air and water pollution and causes a decline in the overall standard of living.

""The residents of this informal settlement, who mostly come from low-income backgrounds, are unable to advocate for themselves and are suffering,"" said Adil.",2023-01-27 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/weekend-read/news/freedom-movement-basic-right-3232541,2023-05-18 10:29:37,thedailystar
528,Is the transportation system failing the youth?,"Public transportation in Bangladesh, particularly in Dhaka, has been a long-standing issue that has only worsened over time. With a population rapidly on the rise, the number of cars on the roads has increased, and the already ineffective public transportation system has become more disjointed. The everyday struggle of commuters from all walks of life is marked by long lines at bus stops and train stations, congested public transportation, and wasted travel time. For Dhaka's millions of young commuters, the situation is particularly dire, with insufficient traffic management and costly and inaccessible public transportation making inter-city travel nothing short of a nightmare.

To demonstrate the questionable situation of transportation services, Titlee Rahman*, an undergraduate student at Dhaka University claims, ""The public transport system in Dhaka, especially buses, have a lot of issues going on. First of all, they take hordes of people in no matter the number of seats left. Furthermore, they seldom follow traffic rules, frequently overtake other vehicles, and try to crash with another bus because of the unhealthy competition which exists between these buses. Then there are often people who will probably try to make me feel uncomfortable through unwanted touches or other forms of harassment such as passing vulgar comments.""

The deteriorating transportation situation in Dhaka has made commuting a daunting experience, particularly for young girls and women. While buses are the most accessible and cost-effective mode of transportation in the city, they are also hazardous, unreliable, and crowded – making women feel vulnerable to sexual harassment. The threat of harassment limits women's freedom to travel and compromises their safety.

Anisa Mumtahina Dewan, a student at Independent University, Bangladesh, shares her experiences of being harassed by men on buses, CNGs, and riding services, and how it has affected her mode of transportation and daily life.

""In one particular instance, I was alone in the CNG and the CNG driver was making lewd gestures and making me uncomfortable during the ride. Since then, I have stopped travelling by CNGs alone and always make sure that I am accompanied by a friend whenever I have to travel in a CNG. I have faced harassment from riders of various ride-hailing services too. One of them saved my number after the ride and decided to call me and harass me over the phone. I had to block their number and I passed their number to my friends who scolded him over the phone and forced him to stop harassing me.""

The poor transportation system in Bangladesh has a significant impact particularly on the education and employment opportunities of young people. Many young people in Bangladesh rely on public transportation to get to school or work, and the unreliable and inefficient system can make it difficult for them to arrive on time or at all. This can often result in missed classes or even dropping out of school altogether, limiting their chances of future success.

Raihana Sharmin, a psychology lecturer at North South University, emphasises, ""Late in classes and exams, and exhaustion is a common consequence of traffic jam which results in difficulty in time management and less productivity in academic and professional life. This in turn can affect life satisfaction and family relationships.""

Titlee Rahman shares further, ""Oftentimes, we have lectures, debates, or seminars arranged by our institution where various guest speakers come and engage with topics of my interest. However, these often tend to happen around the afternoon and end around the evening, maybe sometime around 6 PM. I often have to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of whether I should take part in such events and build my extracurricular profile, or if I should leave early and reach home safely as travelling after the evening often feels unsafe as the CNGs drivers tend to take alternate paths through unknown alleyways after sunset, and buses are particularly unsafe and uncomfortable after dark. This results in me missing out on opportunities such as developing academic or extra-curricular connections which are important for my career, or even recreational activities. I am also not able to pursue my hobbies or interests because I lose a large chunk of my time trying to get to places.""

Limited transportation options also affect young people's employment opportunities. Many jobs require commuting to different parts of the city or even different cities, and the lack of efficient public transportation can make it challenging for young people to secure employment or even attend interviews.

Additionally, these issues tend to affect people's emotional health in harmful ways. Anisa further shares her observation that, ""People overreact even at the minor inconveniences and lash out at others as the emotional toll caused by cumbersome transportation often becomes difficult to manage.""

On top of the issues related to safety, alternatives to buses, such as CNGs or cars from ride-hailing services, are often very expensive.

""Nowadays, a lot of CNG drivers don't agree to a fare less than 400 or 500 taka between my home in Mirpur and Dhaka University, and even 600 taka if the heat is too much or if the weather is a bit gloomy. It is unbearable that I have to spend around 1000 to 1200 taka every day just so that I can travel to my institution,"" adds Titlee. She also stated that while motorbikes from ride-sharing services are cheaper and faster options, the bikers are often reckless, making the rides very unsafe at times.

Similar sentiments were echoed by Tajrian Khan, an A level candidate, who says, ""I have also had minor accidents while travelling on motorbikes. On one occasion when I was travelling to my student's house, the motorbike I was riding crashed into another motorbike. I was lucky enough to anticipate the crash from a distance and was able to jump off the bike in a timely manner. The bikers are often not cautious enough. A few days ago, this biker I was travelling with was speaking over the phone while driving the bike. Another time, a biker was actually scrolling through Facebook while speeding down an empty street.""

Given the pathetic conditions of Dhaka's transportation system, many young people may have to rely on private transportation. For those who can afford it, buying a car or motorbike may be an option, but this comes with additional costs for fuel, maintenance and parking fees. However, those who find themselves unable to opt for private transportation, are left with no other choice but to settle for a less comfortable, unsafe, or unreliable modes of transportation.

For Rahat Mohashin Zarif, a student of Notre Dame College, being able to utilise the train system to travel from Uttara to Kamalapur and back has been beneficial in terms of avoiding Dhaka's bustling traffic. But, Rahat also warns that the train system has room for a lot of improvements. ""The situation with trains is very messed up as well. Not a single train is on time, so there is a high level of uncertainty. To catch my classes at 8:00 AM, I need to catch the train around 6:45 AM, but it often arrives at 7:30 AM or 7:45 AM, making trains a non-viable mode of commute on most days as well. A lot of these are privately run commuter trains, which often wait till the entire train is filled to maximise profits, causing long delays. Also, these trains are often very congested making it the ideal place for pickpocketing. Some of my friends have had bad experiences as they have lost their wallets and phones to pickpockets.""

When asked about the different ways in which they think the transport could be improved, both Anisa and Rahat pointed out the lack of a proper traffic control system in the city which causes traffic congestion.

Tajrian further adds, ""We really need to get rid of car-centric infrastructure and nationalise our public transportation, especially in Dhaka. Traffic policies are never going to be effective until the public transport system is fixed. Privatised buses need to be stopped as they only care about maximising their profits through shady practices and inefficient routes. Introducing nationalised bus services with fixed routes will definitely solve a lot of public transportation issues if managed properly.""

According to Titlee, ""The authorities need to make student-only bus services available, as this will allow young people to travel smoothly across the city. This will also reduce the number of cars in the city as students are more likely to take the student-specific buses if they are comfortable, instead of cars.""

529,Why you should care about the legacy of Final Fantasy,"Here's a tiny story for you: it's a winter from a long time ago. A boy barely 14 years of age starts a game called Final Fantasy VI on an emulator with no prior expectations. As the game slowly opens itself, he watches the old-school 8-bit graphics play out a strikingly beautiful opening scene with cinematic potency. Soon after, the world unravels, and he finds himself adventuring across a land full of magic, technology, and strange magical beasts known as summons.

This is how it started for me, and this has become the legacy of not just Final Fantasy VI, but the franchise as a whole. Embarking on sweeping adventures, exploring fantastical concepts that play out through gripping, deep narratives over the span of dozens of hours, and meeting the liveliest of characters as you attempt to defeat whatever great obstacle you face – these are all that make up the experience of an average Final Fantasy game. None of the 15 mainline games are connected, so one can choose to start whichever title they fancy. Which is for the better given how every single title always is a different beast.

Final Fantasy VII offers a richly developed futuristic sci-fi landscape that explores the fundamental politics of capitalism, whereas Final Fantasy X offers little to no sci-fi elements, opting instead to explore the problems of religious dogmatism through the use of its host of characters.

But that's not to say there are no connections between the games. The threads are loose, and only specific elements cross over. Ideas like worlds filled with magic crystals, character combat archetypes, and mythical beasts that may either aid in combat or be foes to overcome form part of the skeleton of all Final Fantasy games. It's what gives them their identity. Yet, every single game innovates upon these elements with their stories and world-building.

A particular favourite of mine may be seen in Final Fantasy IV, where the archetype of the combat class of Dark Knight is used to explore the darkness inside the heart of our protagonist, Cecil, who undergoes a journey of growth away from a life of senseless violence. The story makes use of these fantastical elements to amplify the weight of the character's growth, and a similar style of narrative can be found across all entries. Some entries focus on singular characters, whereas others focus on entire ensembles.

Then comes the gameplay, those who are not keen on turn-based RPG combat systems may be pushed away from the franchise as it is notorious for maintaining turn-based combat for many of its entries. However, titles such as Final Fantasy XI, XIV, XV, and the upcoming XVI all follow combat systems that are more akin to real-time action RPGs, only with their own bells and whistles. Even the ones that follow the turn-based combat system tend to always attempt to reinvigorate said combat system, which frequently gives new life and personality to each game's experience.

Truthfully, I have not loved every single entry into the franchise. According to the consensus of the online community, I can tell you that I am not alone. But there is a particular magic these stories tend to have, something about the characters, their journey, and the music, all come together wonderfully for me to the point where even at its lowest I have always found something to love.

530,The economic contribution of a stay-at-home mother,"In this intricate web of economics framework, the profound essence of a stay-at-home mother's nurturing role often eludes recognition and appreciation. While their toil may not yield immediate financial gains, its significance transcends monetary measures, resonating deeply within the intricate tapestry of the household and the holistic well-being of the family.

Ann Crittenden argues in her book, The Price of Motherhood: Why the Most Important Job in the World Is Still the Least Valued, that the work of a stay-at-home mother is undervalued because it is seen as a labour of love rather than an economic activity. She points out that if we were to pay stay-at-home mothers for their work, it would cost more than the median salary of a CEO in the United States.

Nancy Folbre, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, emphasises that the economic contribution of a stay-at-home mother is not just in the immediate care she provides to her children, but also in the long-term benefits that result from her work. In her book, The Invisible Heart: Economics and Family Values, Folbre writes, ""The care work that women perform has implications for the health and education of future generations, the quality of the labour force, and the stability of families and communities.""

Moreover, stay-at-home mothers contribute to the economy by saving their families' money on childcare, housekeeping, and meal preparation. The unpaid care work performed by women in Bangladesh, including childcare, cooking, cleaning, and other household chores, is estimated to be worth 76.5 percent of the country's GDP.

Stay-at-home mothers are the unsung heroes who enable our smooth functioning as working individuals. Their selfless commitment and dedicated efforts lay a solid foundation for the rest of the family to pursue their careers without distractions. By managing household responsibilities and providing nurturing care, they create an environment where we can focus on our work with peace of mind. While their tireless contributions often go unnoticed, their presence is indispensable in our ability to excel and pursue our ambitions. They provide the support and reassurance that our families are in capable and loving hands, allowing us to thrive in our professional lives.

The economic contribution of a stay-at-home mother is not without its challenges. In a society that values paid work over unpaid work, stay-at-home mothers often face social and economic marginalisation. They may have difficulty re-entering the workforce after a prolonged absence and may experience a loss of earning potential as a result. Additionally, stay-at-home mothers may not have access to the same social and economic resources as their working counterparts, such as healthcare, retirement benefits, and job training.

The economic contribution of a stay-at-home mother cannot be measured solely in terms of monetary value. As individuals, we can play a role in breaking down societal stigmas surrounding stay-at-home mothers. Let us celebrate their contributions and challenge the notion that their work is less valuable or significant. By doing so, we can foster a culture of respect and appreciation for the diverse roles women play in our society. As Robert F. Kennedy, an American politician and lawyer, once said, ""The GDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.""

It is time for a collective shift in our mindset. We must recognise that the economic contribution of stay-at-home mothers is immeasurable and essential for the well-being of our families and society as a whole. However, we must also acknowledge that this role is oftentimes not taken by choice, as the roles that they take are usually perpetuated by the patriarchy.

Therefore, it is our responsibility to acknowledge and support these incredible individuals who selflessly dedicate themselves to shaping future generations and in creating nurturing homes.

531,The Devil unable to rent an apartment in Dhaka amidst heatwave,"Even though Dhaka residents are not quite happy with the high temperatures, for the occupants of the netherworld, the city has become a rather attractive vacation spot. Dhaka has been seeing an onslaught of otherworldly tourists since the middle of last April, the most prominent figure among the tourists being the Devil himself.

In an interview with our underworld correspondent, the Devil has informed of his intention to extend his stay. ""Truth be told, we're running out of space down there in hell, so some of us needed to relocate to make room for the long lines of fresh arrivals. The weather in Dhaka is beautiful, my minions and I feel quite at home. Besides, it's only the seventh most densely populated city, so we figured we'll lend you a hand in climbing up the rankings,"" he said.

He also expressed a need for semi-permanent lodging as his departure may be prolonged indefinitely. He spoke of his experience in his search for an apartment to be let.

""A lot of people suggested searching around Mohammadpur for the wonderful neighbourhoods, but in reality, I feel like it didn't quite live up to the hype. Granted, I lost my bus fare to a pickpocket, but I expected someone to at least pull a knife on me.""

When inquired about whether being the evil incarnate hinders landlords from being willing to rent their apartments to him, the Devil replied in the negative. He explained that as long as he was willing to pay the abrupt and irrational increases in rent, the nature of his character became trivial.

His search for an apartment brought him to Dhanmondi, where he found that he was entirely unwelcome in the neighbourhood as he did not address the place by its proper and respectful name – DMD. He proceeded to tell us about his search in Moghbazar, where he did find a decent apartment, but the landlord was quite against installing an air conditioner.

""I know I'm supposed to be from hell and all, but I am ageing. I can't live in that area without a decent air cooler, I'm not the one who's supposed to be tortured.""

When asked whether he had considered getting a place in Uttara, he seemed rather surprised by the insinuation that it's actually a part of Dhaka. He recounted his experience at Bijoy Sarani and Tejgaon flyover with some fondness, but absolutely refused to elaborate on his ventures at Puran Dhaka.

""There are a few more areas I have left to search in, and I'm still hopeful I'll find something,"" Satan said.

Upon being suggested to consider Gulshan, he laughed and said, ""Come on, even emptying out hell's treasury can't pay for a place there.""

Unfortunately, the interview had to be cut short as Satan's casual remark about printing more money was overheard by a passing finance bro. Whether Satan would still be willing to live amidst humans after that exchange remains unknown.

532,Making our city beautiful,"SHOUT sat down with Mohammed Abu Sufian, the individual who supervised the artists responsible for bringing the pillars of the Moghbazar flyover to vivid life. We managed to sneak in a small yet thought-provoking conversation with them, with Abu Sufian as the artists' representative for our interview.

What can you tell us about how this work came to life?

Abu Sufian: This was carried out under the authority of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) with the sole intention of figuring out a way to stop the spread of the disastrous state of pillars across the city.

For now, we are only doing the pillars that start at Moghbazar and go up to the rail gate. Many of these pillars have far too many posters and advertisements which give it an ugly look, almost to the point where no one wanted to even look at the pillars. So, the whole purpose here is to make these pillars beautiful, and that's how DNCC gave us this opportunity to make the area look livelier and pleasing to the eyes.

Did DNCC have to reach out to a particular organisation to make this happen?

Abu Sufian: No, actually. Most of us are students of the Faculty of Fine Arts at Dhaka University. We don't belong to any specific group. DNCC reached out to the faculty and with their cooperation and the mayor's blessing, we have been able to carry this out. The work has been done by many different artists, each bringing their own unique style. While I personally helped in gathering artists, it was not a very difficult process since we artists are very keen on trying new and exciting things.

What's the process like for painting these pillars? Could you walk me through the whole thing?

Abu Sufian: The artists mainly work at night, sometimes up until 2-3 AM, and every pillar takes around three days to complete. The duration depends on several factors such as making sure all the artists are present and coordinating ideas and much more. Right now, we're working on another new pillar that may take a similar length of time.

This work that you're doing is under the city corporation's authority. What do you think about doing more street art that isn't necessarily under authority?

Abu Sufian: We'd very much love to do something like that. We are appreciators of art of all kinds, and to be able to do more street art, especially alongside others, is a fantastic idea. However, whenever we, as artists, attempt something new, we are always bound to face certain restrictions. ""Do this, don't do that"" and whatnot. This feedback comes from everywhere, so there's obviously a huge challenge that we need to always face. Artists are free people, they like having freedom in their work, so with barriers things do feel difficult.

Photo: Orchid Chakma

Personally, would you like to do more community-driven street art?

Abu Sufian: Yes, absolutely. We want to celebrate this more because the more people learn and love art like this, the more artists will be valued. This is actually a loop because as more artists find recognition, the more we will find ourselves wanting to hone our skills and make better art. And when something is pretty to look at, it obviously makes everyone feel better.

What has the response been to this whole project? And what obstacles have you faced in carrying this out?

Abu Sufian: Obstacles have been rather minimal, fortunately. Everyone who has seen our work here now seems to be of the same mind – all pillars should be decorated like this. They want this beauty to spread across the city.

As artists, we are overjoyed with how positive the reception is, but at the same time, we should also try to be careful to preserve the beauty that we have strived to create. Spilling dirt, muck, or even urinating in these spaces is, sadly, quite common. We have seen a lot of these with our own eyes and have had to stop them from happening while we were hard at work. Everyone should try their best to not use these spaces however they want. When more people are careful about preserving beauty, it will last longer.

In the past, we have seen people who do not like street art take steps to stop it. Have you faced anything like that?

Abu Sufian: Not at all, none of that came our way. Everything we have painted has been entirely for the benefit of society and the development of a clean and beautiful city. We would not want to attempt anything that would be hurtful to the people of this society, and anything that may contain ideas that will hurt others will never be something we would be interested in doing. We try our best to spread kind and thoughtful messages all around through our art. If you see through all the pillars, you'll actually notice a lot of the messages that we're trying to deliver.

Photo: Orchid Chakma

Do you have any further plans for decorating other flyovers?

Abu Sufian: For now, we have not talked about any such thing with the city corporation, so this is it. But then there is something to be said about the state of so many of these pillars with their posters, ads, and dirt that make them unsightly. We, as artists, very much want to work towards making them a sight to behold. That's very important to us, and I think the Moghbazar flyover may be the start of something new in this way. Who knows, maybe soon enough we'll be doing this all across the city.

533,Why we should include philosophy in our curriculum,"In 2022, I visited Lisbon, Portugal, to take part in the International Philosophy Olympiad – an event aimed at promoting the study of Philosophy at the high school level globally.

Over the span of four days, I engaged in conversations with participants from more than 40 countries about the importance of studying Philosophy in today's world. We all acknowledged the relevance of studying Philosophy in today's world, despite hailing from academic backgrounds with a heavy focus on science subjects.

As more students opt for STEM subjects for its financial prospects, the importance of liberal arts is shrinking, leading us to ask, ""How is it affecting our education?""

The discussion was intriguing when it was brought up that Philosophy is either a compulsory subject or an optional one in most education systems of the Western world. It's even valued as an important subject necessary for a well-rounded education.

While some of my peers from other countries were introduced to the subject early in their high school, others like myself pursued it through self-study out of sheer curiosity because it's not offered in our curriculum.

But what if we, too, incorporated Philosophy into our school curriculum?

In essence, philosophy pushes us to question the world around us. It plays a crucial role in helping students gain a deeper understanding of ethical and moral issues by urging them to think critically and ask questions. This has become a valuable skill in classrooms and in the current world, as we are constantly bombarded with information. The subject can help us form informed opinions and make better decisions without blindly accepting whatever piece of information or opinion we may view online or be presented with.

Philosophy also emphasises the importance of meaningful debates and respectful dialogue. It's an essential practice to continue in classrooms to teach students to be more tolerant and inclusive, while providing room to freely exchange ideas without the fear of censorship.

All of the above reasons illustrate how philosophy has the potential to have a profound impact on Bangladeshi youth, helping them shape their worldview and develop the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in today's complex and rapidly changing world.

While the higher secondary level in Bangladesh does include a subject named ""Logic"", the syllabus does not cover the other important branches of the subject like Aesthetics, Ethics, and Political Philosophy.

The main issue with our education system is the rigid core curriculum which discourages students to explore other subjects, its lack of practical application, and the focus on rote learning and restricting students from opting for the humanities. But one solution for this eroding system could be introducing subjects like Philosophy, as it has the ability to foster free thinking among students, though its proper implementation remains a concern.

Interacting with diverse students at the Philosophy Olympiad made me realise how highly valued the subject is in the education curriculum of other parts of the world where free speech, critical thinking and democratic values are highly regarded. Maybe it could be the same in Bangladesh, too.

535,NSU and Calcutta University strengthen ties through collaborative seminar on history and heritage,"To foster friendly ties between Bangladesh and India, scholars from North South University (NSU) and Calcutta University (CU) discussed various historical and current issues today. The special seminar, titled ""Aspects of Bangladesh-West Bengal: History and Heritage"" was organised by NSU to celebrate the 162nd birthday of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Faculty members delivered five talks from both institutions, and NSU VC Prof. Atiqul Islam chaired the event.

CU VC Professor Asis Kumar Chattopadhyay joined the seminar online, emphasising the need for research and cultural collaboration between the two universities. Prof. Atiqul Islam highlighted the impact of Sufism on Islam in the region and stressed the importance of cultural and research cooperation to maintain communal harmony.

Among the topics discussed were the cosmopolitan character of West Bengal, the historical evolution of Dhaka city, the colonial drug trade in Bengal, and society and culture in mediaeval Bengal. The seminar also addressed the vulnerability of the Bengal Delta to climate change and natural disasters.

Deliberating on Cosmopolitan Kolkata, CU Department of History Prof. Dr Kingshuk Chatterjee observed that the cosmopolitan character of West Bengal has receded after the partition of India, which is a worrying trend. NSU Professor of History and Philosophy Department Dr Sharif Uddin Ahmed highlighted how Dhaka City, the Queen of the East, evolved through various milestones of history. Dwelling on the Colonial Drug Trade in Bengal, NSU Professor of History and Philosophy Department Dr M. Emdadul Haq observed that the British ruler earned more than 50 percent of its revenue from the drug business in the region.

On the issue of Society and Culture in Mediaeval Bengal, Prof. Dr Amit Kumar Dey of the History Department at Calcutta University observed that to ensure friendship between Muslim and Hindu communities in the region, historians must reconstruct the past and with the help of empathetic political leadership in the region, it will be possible to maintain a balanced connection with people of neighbouring countries.

Dwelling on the Bengal Delta: Its Vulnerability to Climate Change and Natural Disasters, Prof. Dr Md. Sirajul Islam of NSU's Director of the Centre for Infrastructure Research and Services observed that the Bengal Delta poses a significant threat to the region from a climate change perspective. He stressed fast-tracking collaboration between Bangladesh and India in this area.

Earlier in the day, a daylong Boishakhi Mela was held at the NSU playground, featuring 45 different stalls, Nagardola, puppet dance, and more. Students from both universities attended the fair, including a CU's Department of History delegation. The day concluded with a captivating cultural performance by Calcutta University students at the NSU Auditorium.",2023-05-13 12:46:24,https://www.thedailystar.net/shout/bulletin-board/news/nsu-and-calcutta-university-strengthen-ties-through-collaborative-seminar-history-and-heritage-3318846,2023-05-18 10:29:46,thedailystar
536,Beau Is Afraid and I am confused: Ari Aster’s comedic venture is still scary,"""I think I need to call my mom,"" a middle-aged gentleman remarked to me as everyone got out of the theatre after a three-hour-long anxious viewing of Beau Is Afraid, Ari Aster's newest comedy-horror about a man's attempt to reconnect with his mother despite having the ""disappointment"" label imposed on him throughout his life.

If you are not familiar with Ari Aster's previous works, this movie may not be for you as watching it will most definitely elicit a rather wrongful first impression of the director's works. Beau Is Afraid is the result of giving an emerging director who's made a mark in cinema their creative freedom; I'm just not convinced he should be allowed to use them again.

The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix playing Beau Wasserman, an extremely anxious sad-sack with no redeemable qualities that allow the viewers to grow a liking to him and Joaquin Phoenix's performance is nothing short of excellent.

The film surrounds Beau being confronted with one unfortunate event after another. Even if all of it may be made up in his mind, watching him go through the worst doesn't enable the audience to empathise with him. Throughout the film, I wasn't sure if I should root for him. Beau has nothing going on for himself, and everything he experiences is too bad to be true.

The runtime is painstakingly long, and it is only the first act that seems to make the most sense. The first scenes are fast-paced and even if hyperbolic, the events he goes through make sense. The camera work in the city scenes proves to be well-thought-out and beautifully executed.

In the second act, however, there is a severe tonal shift in the movie after which the plot suffers and becomes confusing just for the sake of it. If the entirety of the second act was cut out from the movie, it would make no difference to my understanding of the film.

The third act is where more of our questions start getting answered. Beau finally comes face to face with his mother and this is where a lot of the issues surrounding mother-son relationships float to the surface. Maybe you will find some elements of relatability in Patti LuPone's monologue about having to love someone who constantly and unfailingly disappoints, but that gets drowned out in the overwhelming concentration of nonsensical hogwash that goes on in the scenes surrounding it.

If you're watching Beau Is Afraid with the intention of finding out what it's about, you're probably doing it wrong. There is no puzzle to piece together or a mystery to solve. Psychological horror is the newest craze, and the notion is there is always a lesson to take away at the end. However, I walked out of the theatre gaining no new viewpoints of the world.

Just watching the movie, itself won't suffice to understand it, but maybe the point isn't to understand the film. Maybe all it does is exist as a reminder that you should always call your mom to check up on her.

537,EDITORIAL,"How important is transportation, really? People talk about it all the time, its problems and nuances become matters of national discourse, entire Facebook groups of thousands of people are dedicated to discussing and meme-ing it. But is all of that warranted, or does transportation have an outsized influence on its surroundings? Because at the end of the day, people are still getting places. They're late, they're tired, but most of them are getting to their destinations, right?

Things change when you think of this issue in terms of hours lost in traffic or lost waiting for buses and trains. Think about the money lost by the accumulation of the extra five taka a passenger has to pay the bus conductor every day simply to avoid a confrontation, or the years lost from their lives when one considers the toxic fumes they have to inhale because bus owners simply refuse to comply with vehicle fitness regulations. If these human level sufferings fail to make a mark, think of the productivity lost because of all this, and what damage it does to the economy.

538,First flight of a flightless bird,"I write to you in songs that come from the migratory birds that flock

The skies and swing by the river beside my stick house in search of shelter.

I am a stickman. And I write from uncertain times, a distant future, sped up

As the sun goes down when it's dusk, with the blood of the moon shining crimson red

And the night sky upon us.

I pen misery with dark black ink that I draw from a hole inside of my chest

And as you can see, I am slowly nearing an ink crisis.

A void of words, as you continue to replace them with colors,

A stickman's job is to stare at the sky and heave breaths of disdain and curse

At the world, the wind, and everything that goes by

But it's different for me now. The world is ending soon.

I would like to be of some help to you. Protect what we share –

Every name we give it, and all the reasons why

Before the ground I place my weight on catches fire

Like a sapling full of life, nourish it with soil and water.

Paint my hands with dirt, mud, and care.

I would like to spiral with you into the cursed depths of this hollow earth

And fly my way back to you, wherever you are.

Whether it be a five-minute walk or two continents apart –

From where the migratory birds emerge,

From where their wings take first flight,

I would like to fly back to you

And never leave home again.

539,Mason Jar,"Another night spent awaiting the sunrise. I look out my window facing a mesh of red, orange, yellow hues against a vast, cerulean canvas. I must disagree with the poets. Each morning, it is the same, in its staggeringly tedious white-on-blue enormity, it is the same sky.

The trophy I had wanted since childhood sits menacingly on the shelf. I blink, hoping it might take a brand-new shape. But it remains, the solid object I brought home a few weeks ago. The same hunk of metal and wood moulded into a gramophone, grand and golden, with ""FIRST PLACE"" engraved on its side like letters on a tombstone.

I stare bleary eyed as my lock screen tells me I have a new message.

""I'm so proud of you, Abrar! I always knew you'd win. There's nothing you can't do! I promise, it will only get better from here.""

""Thank you for your kind words."" My fingers type out and hit send.

In the past few days, my body has learnt five different ways to reflexively thank someone – automated responses to all my well-wishers.

My mother is upset that I have not sat at the piano since the competition. Initially she assumed I had been rewarding myself with a small break. Now she notices the hollow in my eyes. She notices my untouched meals and unkempt hair. Soon she will come into my room to remind me of my gift. She will ask me why I run from it, now of all times.

How can I explain that playing the piano feels like racing towards nothing? I have no new shinier trophy to set my eyes on. I have no grand title to chase.

My father had bought me my piano when I was a child, and I had longed to master the instrument since. Multiple tutors and hundreds of practice sessions passed when the true reach of my talents began to unfold. Once I found out about the competition in Prague, the course of my life was set.

After years of hard work, a few months ago I finally secured a spot in the competition. And so, my mother and I flew out to Prague a month beforehand. Only one thing stood before my mind's eye: a prize that would be a testimony for my entire career. Each day I would sit at my piano by the window until I knew the Double Thirds Etude like the back of my hand. Each night I would know no sleep. I would stare down at the keys until they'd stared back at me. Stoic expressions on their dull, dead faces. I wouldn't stop until I brought them to life.

On the fateful night, my mind was not my own. A stranger, in a strange theatre of a strange city, wandering in a stranger's body, I drifted in place. As they called my name, I fought down a bout of nausea and entered the stage. Each moment of my life had been cascading towards this point. I felt the burden of a thousand eyes on me, a thousand ears prepared to hear the verdict of whether I would pass on my own life. A hundred flashing lights. Rapturous applause followed by a silence that hung by a thread. My fingers edged towards the keys, approached the final chapter of my biography as I pressed down, an alien note emanating from the piano and drifting into my ears.

With the final key I signed my sentence, either to ascend or to die. Or both.

Towards the end of the night they announced that I had won.

I heard no applause nor cheer. Backstage, I gave in to the bout of nausea and allowed my insides to empty themselves of bile. I let go of the fear, told myself I had finally done it. My dream was finally in the palm of my hands, with nowhere else to put it.

My book has been written, the epilogue closed. I am standing on the other side of my biography. I read through the pages, relive the scenes that brought me all my glory. I have now become a container for the past; a mason jar to hold all my memories in place.

540,What makes a “good” university lecturer?,"One fine morning I woke up and managed to push myself to get dressed and start for my university to attend my classes. After struggling to find a bus in the scorching heat and going through the challenges of Dhaka traffic, I finally reached my class only to listen to my professor reading out the slides. As time passed, I started questioning if I was the only one who had problems with this particular method of teaching.

I am usually least bothered by the course instructor I am assigned to and have never sweat too much about sections, however, it has cost me. I quickly came to the realisation that not predicting the section and course instructor beforehand might cost me the entire course fee, as I would inevitably have to drop the course or retake it due to a bad grade. So, I had to ensure I always ended up with a ""good"" lecturer.

But what entails a lecturer to be considered ""good""? Is it someone's ability to continue taking classes even if they just read slides continuously? Is it the tedious method of making things understandable, which may or may not add to the student's knowledge? Is it the number of foreign degrees the person has already attained?

While it is a given that lecturers must come from good academic results and diligence, it is also equally important for them to be approachable, innovative, and generally good communicators in both languages. During the four years I have spent trying to attain my undergraduate degree, I met a few lecturers who possessed all of these characteristics who went above and beyond to make the lectures more interesting and engaging, causing students' to make use of their critical thinking skills.

Our parents spend an enormous amount of their hard-earned money after our bachelor's degree, but are we getting the proper education and resources to compete in the future? Are we being led in the right direction to think outside the box and create something unique? Is an 'A' all we need to stand out in the crowd?

Students in their early years of university look forward to their favourite lecturers for career advice, guidance, and assistance. However, someone who has a strict teaching style and encourages memorising will only warrant paraphrased information from slides and book chapters that will never add up to the student's knowledge or skillset.

There are highly qualified individuals who have written outstanding papers and have conducted ground-breaking research, but lack the qualities of a good teacher. On the other hand, there are those who have little professional experience with research or writing but possess a knack for teaching.

While writing this article, I pondered heavily if I was even eligible to raise the issue of university teachers' teaching methods. But I, along with many students like me, am the one being impacted by the teachers' poor teaching methods. When hiring university lecturers, the concerned authority should consider not only their academic performance but also their teaching style and ability to connect with students.

541,Viewing gleaning in Bangladesh through Varda’s lens,"An ode to the Bangladeshi gleaners

Three women, two bowing and one pausing briefly to catch her breath. Behind them, some farmworkers can be seen using a fork to load grain into a cart while others are piling it into huge stacks. The harvesters labour tirelessly under the supervision of a mounted overseer. The scent of the air speaks of harvest, but these women are not harvesting, they are gleaning. Although the bent posture has not disappeared from our society yet, the description of the scenery is from the painting by Jean-François Millet named ""Des Glaneuses"" or ""The Gleaners"".

Gleaning is a term used in the agriculture business to describe collecting crops abandoned in the field after all other food resources have been harvested. Agnès Varda, one of the pioneers of the French New Wave era, paid tribute to the people she left behind to pick up the camera. Yes, she used to glean.

The Gleaners and I examines the essence of gleaning, yet, it does not simply centre on the French countryside where our beloved Millet envisioned his piece. Rather, it pays respect to people who are ""dumpster diving"" in a way that corresponds with the spirit of gleaning. Varda gives space to those who used to glean, but the efficiency of modern machinery has stripped them of their titles. From the potatoes of Beauce to the oysters of Noirmoutier, Varda has captured it all on her hand-held camera.

One thing nearly all gleaners share is poverty. Since biblical times, gleaning has been practised. Some landowners allow it, others don't.

The northern and southern parts of Bangladesh are no strangers to gleaning. People of Khulna's Sreepur upazila, Rangpur's Aditmari, Pirgachha, Kaunia, Kishoreganj, Thakurgaon, Khansama upazila, and Mymensingh's Durgapur upazila are well-known for their tendency to glean rice crops. These leftover crops are found inside rat burrows. Women, men, and children all gather rice from the burrows after the crops have been harvested.

The gleaners collect the rice crops in the late autumn and winter. It's an almost 12-hour-long ordeal as one rat burrow can yield nearly eight to ten kilograms of rice crops. Within 10-12 days, the gleaners can dig through almost 20-25 holes. Some children refuse to go to school during the gleaning season because of the sheer joy of collecting crops that are going to sustain their family for months. The families dream of making dishes with the rice they glean.

Digging through the rat holes is exhausting, but the penniless residents of these regions of Bangladesh may harvest 120-160 kilograms of rice daily, so the effort is worthwhile.

Gleaning is not a solitary task – groups of women glean together, just like in the painting of Millet. Every year, the country sees a massive loss of crops because of rat infestation, but this loss could be considered a blessing to these people.

542,Aftersun is a devastating portrayal of the gulf between parents and children,"What is the distance between moments and memories? Poets might say it's somewhere in the middle of yesterday and forever. But if they were to tell you how to bridge this inescapable distance, their prose might fall short.

Charlotte Wells's semi-autobiographical debut feature Aftersun is a love letter to childhood memories. The film feels like flipping through a scrapbook of memories. 11-year-old Sophie goes on a trip to Turkey with her father, Calum on his 31st birthday. Nothing dramatic happens.

Sophie, on the cusp of adolescence, is trying to break free from her childhood. She has an easy, friendlike relationship with her father. She tells Calum one night how she naively thought he and her mother would get married. Throughout their trip, she tries to gauge Calum, to truly know him.

Frankie Corio as Sophie is a tour de force, utterly fooling the audience that this is her major acting role. If Corio's Sophie is the heart of the film, Paul Mescal's Calum remains the soul. Mescal's ability to exhibit raw emotional vulnerability and appear emotionally naked on the screen remains unmatched.

Calum is a tragedy depicted as a man. His whole existence is adrift. The symptoms of Calum's depression creep in slowly – sometimes through his sombre body language, sometimes through his decaying self-esteem. Every time he sighs, it infiltrates the souls of the viewers. His breakdown on his birthday after everyone sings for him hit me like a ton of bricks. The story of his eleventh birthday indicates an abusive childhood. Despite everything, he is trying his hardest to be a good father to Sophie, to give her happy memories to look back on.

Charlotte Wells paints the emotional canvas of the film with her masterful filmmaking brushes. Visual narration rows the film rather than heavy dialogues. The inconspicuous moments create the overriding fabric of the film. From the beginning, you can feel a tragedy looming. It's like watching a story unfold which has already climaxed.

Twenty years later when adult Sophie, who is a parent now, is looking at the footage of their trip, she views her father from a new vantage point – trying to piece together the parts of her father that she wasn't aware of before.

When we are young, our naive eyes view everything through a rosy lens. But as maturity dawns on us, we realise there are a multitude of things we do not know about our parents.

The needle drop moment has to be Calum dancing to ""Under Pressure"". It remains one of the best scenes of the movie. The strobe lights take a metaphorical meaning – it signifies the fading essence of memory. Sophie's memory of her father is fragmented. And the longer time goes on, the fragile fabric of memory keeps decaying. As we cannot see Calum properly in the store lights, Sophie cannot seem to remember everything about her father. At one point, Calum falls and adult Sophie cannot reach him anymore. It mirrors Sophie struggling to hold on to whatever is left of her memories of her father.

Wells creates new semantics for love and memory through her piercingly poignant storytelling. The camcorder here is an insignia of memory. She weaves the past and present together in the most heartbreaking way. The emotional string of Aftersun kept tugging on my heartstrings until I noticed my heart had bled.

The past is not conclusive. For some, the interlude between moments and memories can mean joyous nostalgia, for some, it brings a sense of dread. Nevertheless, there will always remain a gulf between the two. Aftersun makes that very declaration – we can at best make sense of the past, not reinvent it.

543,Prevention of Child Marriage in remote and marginalised chars of northern Bangladesh,"Friendship in association with The Daily Star organised a roundtable titled “Prevention of Child Marriage in remote and marginalised chars of Northern Bangladesh” on March 16, 2023. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Golam Mortaza, Editor, The Daily Star Bangla

Preventing child marriage requires a multifaceted approach. One crucial aspect is ensuring accountability of local government representatives and government officials. who are entrusted with the task to prevent child marriage. Empowering those involved in development work is also essential, as they can become agents of change in their communities and work towards preventing this social menace.

Religion can play a powerful role in shaping attitudes and beliefs, so it is vital to engage religious leaders and communities in efforts to prevent child marriage. Addressing financial solvency is also critical, as poverty can be a contributing factor to practices like child marriage.

Ahmed Toufiqur Rahman, Deputy Director (Inclusive Citizenship), Friendship

Bangladesh has the world's third-highest rate of child marriage, with a prevalence of 51%. According to a World Bank report, the rate is higher in rural areas (60%) than in urban areas (55%), with Rajshahi and Rangpur being the most affected.

The Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government has undertaken multiple initiatives to prevent child marriage, including strengthening laws related to child marriage, raising the minimum legal age of marriage, providing girls access to education, providing income-generating activities for girls forming international partnerships developing policies, such as the National Action Plan to Eliminate Child Marriage 2018-2030 and the Child Marriage Restraint Act. Digital initiatives such as the Joy app, Tottho Apa, and a hotline (109) have been launched.

NGOs and other development agencies are also working with various advocacies and awareness campaigns at the grassroots, district, and national levels. They empower girls through education, vocational training, leadership, and life skills development programs, while families receive support through financial assistance, livelihood, health, and social services.

Robert Chatterton Dickson, British High Commissioner to Bangladesh

Although Bangladesh has achieved significant progress in economic and social development over the past 50 years, the issue of preventing child marriage has not seen similar success. Child marriage not only harms individuals by impeding their health and ability to live a fully equal life, but it also has harmful effects on society as a whole.

During a visit to the Char areas of Northern Bangladesh, I witnessed how marginalised and impoverished communities live beyond the purview of the government. Friendship, in addition to providing health, education, and livelihood services to the Char people, works to give women a voice in their community.

The policies and initiatives taken at the policy and higher levels need to align with the practical realities of marginalised communities in the Char areas. Friendship's approach is commendable as they base their expertise on respect for the communities and individuals they work with.

Tapan Karmaker, Executive Director, RDRS

A major portion of Kurigram district is located in the char areas, encompassing 49 unions. In 2017, RDRS launched a special project, Building Better Future for Girls (BBFG), to address the issue of child marriage in Kurigram district, including the char areas.

One of the project's initial interventions involved enrolling families with girls under 18 at risk of child marriage in the government's Social Safety Net program, which provides economic support to families to prevent them from marrying off their children. While three upazilas in Kurigram have been declared child marriage-free by the district administration after a survey conducted under the Prime Minister's guidance, social security for at-risk girls remains a major concern, particularly in remote Char areas.

Natalie McCauley, Chief, Child Protection Team, UNICEF

The child protection system in Bangladesh needs to be strengthened, and the number of social workers should be increased. Currently, there are just over 3000 social workers, but more than 110,000 are required for the social welfare ministry to fulfill its mandate effectively.

The Child Helpline 1098 received 200,000 calls last year, and it has been able to stop many child marriages. More than 80% of these calls are related to violence, abuse, and exploitation. Unfortunately, nine out of ten children are affected by violence within their homes, pushing families towards harmful practices such as child marriages. We need to support these families in creating safe environments for their children so that they have other options.

Violence against women and children, including child marriage, costs more than 3% of the GDP. Bangladesh loses billions of dollars annually, whereas the cost of hiring one social worker is around 4000 USD a year. Therefore, increased budgets for children's welfare and the creation of a department for children's affairs in the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs are necessary.

Mosammat Lucky Akhter, Program Manager, Nagorik Uddyog

From our extensive experience working in disaster-prone areas of Rangpur and Barishal since 2004, it has become evident that families affected by natural disasters are particularly vulnerable to child marriage. Despite our efforts to raise awareness among these communities, families often resort to extreme measures during times of crisis, such as forcing their children into marriage. Our previous mass awareness campaigns have had limited success, indicating that more targeted and sustained efforts are required at the grassroots level.

Dr Umme Busra Fateha Sultana, Associate Professor & Chairperson, Department of Women and Gender Studies, University of Dhaka

It is crucial to prevent early pregnancies and protect the health of young girls who are forced into child marriages. Moreover, providing support for their education and economic independence is essential even after marriage. Additionally, equipping them with self-defence skills and knowledge of legal help is vital.

To raise awareness about the dangers of child marriage, media can play a pivotal role, the Meena cartoon for instance has been an effective tool in creating awareness of social issues.

Onno Van Manen, Country Director, Save the Children, Bangladesh

Despite legislation addressing child marriage and sexual violence, there are still loopholes in the system. To empower and support children, particularly girls, it's essential to provide them with access and agency to address their challenges. Unfortunately, girls in char areas often lack access to technology and systems that could assist them. Girls may feel embarrassed or hesitant to come forward, so outreach efforts should be proactive. Incorporating sexual health education into school curricula is necessary. While preventive work with stakeholders is ongoing, child marriages persist because of a lack of negative consequences for facilitators. Addressing this gap is another critical area to address.

Marie Masdupuy, Ambassador of France to Bangladesh

Surprisingly, forced child marriages are still prevalent in Bangladesh despite the introduction long ago of family planning programs and their successful outreach to various parts of society.

Unfortunately, adolescent girls in rural areas tend to drop out of school as soon as they reach puberty due to lack of resources and societal pressure to get married early. To combat this issue, I believe that specialised social workers are needed to aid underage children and raise awareness about the negative consequences of child marriage.

Collaboration with governmental programmes and NGOs is crucial in preventing not only child marriage but also intra-family violence.

Md. Mainul Islam, Acting Country Director & Head of Programme, Norwegian Refugee Council, Bangladesh

Child marriage in Bangladesh is often a desperate measure taken by families facing economic hardship during natural disasters. To address this issue, we must provide alternative coping mechanisms to families in these situations.

In remote char areas, girls are often forced to drop out of school after primary level due to social pressures and lack of opportunities. We must advocate for the introduction of vocational courses designed for girls in these areas to equip them with life skills and promote self-sufficiency through income generation.

Nasima Akhter Joly, Secretary, National Girl Child Advocacy Forum

Nimmi Akhter, a tenth-grade student from Comilla, was forced into marriage without her consent, despite her desire to continue her studies and become self-sufficient. The local Kazi facilitated the marriage. He claimed that since the girl had reached puberty, there was no religious issue with the marriage. Puberty alone cannot be the indicator of a girl's adulthood; it takes a minimum of 18 years for girls' organs to mature for reproductive health. We need to campaign for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) to ensure the well-being of girls and women.

Simply relying on legal clauses will not be enough to combat child marriage. Women's participation in decision-making processes is essential, as in most cases, the mother and girl are unaware of the decision being finalised.

Barrister Ayesha Taasin Khan, Senior Director & Head of Inclusive Citizenship Sector, Friendship

While the Child Marriage Restraint Act has shown some impact in urban areas, rural communities remain largely unaffected, and child marriage continues to persist. The problem is compounded by the fact that the law allows girls to marry at the age of 16 under ""special circumstances,"".

To truly combat child marriage, we need a social revolution that recognises the harm it causes, as well as institutional changes that provide girls with opportunities to improve their lives. One such opportunity is through vocational training programmes in schools that equip girls with the skills and knowledge to generate their income and become self-sufficient, reducing the burden of girls as liabilities.

The government should also take measures to inform girls about the Child Marriage Restraint Act and provide them with avenues to take action through on digital platforms or through provisions such as Salish, ADR, etc.. While the Act is a significant step in addressing child marriage, it must be coupled with infrastructure and transformative societal change to have a meaningful impact.

Mohammod Rafiqul Islam, Director, Head Office, Islamic Foundation Bangladesh

Religious leaders, particularly Imams, hold a significant role and are respected in society. They have proven to be effective in the facilitation and dissemination of important information to the public in promoting vaccination and breastfeeding programs in Bangladesh. Aligning social and transformative initiatives with religious morals can ensure sustainability and community acceptance. Islam also has a positive impact on health safety, and Imams can educate their followers on the harmful impacts of early motherhood. In a UNICEF-supported program, Imams emphasised that puberty alone is not a sufficient indicator for pregnancy. Their involvement can be crucial in promoting positive social change.

The 2017 Child Marriage Restraint Act emphasises the importance of involving all relevant stakeholders, including GOs and NGOs, at the grassroots level. However, the act doesn't specify who should intervene when child marriages occur. It is important to note that child marriage is a non-cognizable offense, which limits the police's ability to take swift action.

Over the past three years, there have been over four crore calls made to the hotline number 999, but many people are not aware of the hotline number 109. To increase efficiency, it may be helpful to merge or redirect these two numbers. Additionally, a Women, Children, Elderly and Disabled helpdesk, operated by female police officers, has been established in all 659 police stations across the country. Regular supervision of this helpdesk is necessary, and there is a need for more female officers to staff it. Last year, this helpdesk assisted 144,00 women and children.

M A Akher, Director Planning, Department of Youth Development, Ministry of Youth and Sports

The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) reports that approximately 8 million individuals aged 15-24 in Bangladesh are not engaged in employment, education, or training (NEET). Of this NEET population, 47% are women and 10% are men, accounting for a total of 28.8% of the youth population in the country. To address this issue, the Department of Youth Development has established over 19,800 Youth Clubs nationwide, 6,000 of which are registered with our department. There are also 71 Youth Training Centers across the country, where various training sessions are held throughout the year.

Given the complexity of this situation, we have partnered with the World Bank to propose a training program for individuals between the ages of 15 and 35, with a budget of 4,000 crores BDT. Girls will comprise 80% of the programme's beneficiaries since many young women who are married off early require education and training to become self-sufficient. We also provide soft loans to support sustainable businesses and self-sufficiency for these girls. Moreover, with the help of USAID, we are launching a skill-based training programme for girls aged 15-35 in 250 upazilas across Bangladesh.

Runa Khan, Founder & Executive Director, Friendship

Each child marriage prevented is equivalent to saving a life. Collaborative efforts by organisations and the government are essential in preventing child marriage, which is linked to poverty and climate change. Climate change can lead to poverty, which then drives parents to resort to forced child marriages.

We must adopt a holistic approach to tackle the issue of child marriage and create awareness at the grassroots level by involving both men and women. Everyone should understand the grave consequences of child marriage in terms of health, death, and disease. The solution should be comprehensive, and the government and other organizations should work towards alleviating poverty, especially in rural char areas.

The National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) should incorporate awareness about child rights and anti-child marriage measures from pre-primary to college level. We must provide young girls with inspiring female role models and leaders who can instill hope and self-respect in them.

The police should play a more active role, and we need to address the issue of inaccurate birth certificates for many children.

It is unacceptable for Bangladesh to be the third country in the world with the highest incidence of child marriage, and we must take a holistic approach rather than just planning to act.

Tanjim Ferdous, In Charge of NGOs and Foreign Missions at the Business Development Team, The Daily Star, & Moderator of the session

Child marriage stems from deep-seated gender inequality and the notion that girls and women are of lower value than boys and men. It is aggravated by factors such as poverty, inadequate education, harmful cultural practices, and insecurity, with drivers that vary by community and region.

The COVID-19 lockdown has led to a considerable rise in child marriage rates in Bangladesh, while climate change and the resulting displacement of communities have also served as catalysts for this issue.

544,10 years since Rana Plaza tragedy,"Solidarity Center and IndustriAll Bangladesh Council (IBC), with the support of USAID, organised a roundtable titled “Workers’ Health-Safety & Trade Union Rights: Where are we now?” on the occasion of 10 years since the Rana Plaza tragedy on April 13, 2023. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Kutubuddin Ahmed, General Secretary, IndustriAll Bangladesh Council (IBC)

Following the tragic Rana Plaza incident, IBC and several other organisations joined forces to improve conditions for workers. A committee was formed to investigate the accident, and 36 individuals, including Sohel Rana, were held accountable. The recent release of Sohel Rana on bail has been strongly criticized by trade unions, and it is important that all those responsible face exemplary punishment.

The Accord and Alliance have made significant progress in improving fire and building safety in around 1,800 industries. However, the RMG Sustainability Council (RSC) has not produced expected results and needs to be reorganized with the input of trade unions. Strengthening trade unions is crucial to improve conditions for workers, and the government and other stakeholders should work together to make them more efficient and organised. International intervention is necessary to update labour laws and make them more favourable for workers. By effectively implementing the ILO roadmap, we can achieve sustainable and durable trade unions and industrial growth.

Monika Hartsel, Deputy Country Program Director, Solidarity Center- Bangladesh office

We are gathered here today to remember the tragic collapse of Rana Plaza. We mourn for the 1,138 people who were killed. We mourn for their families and friends who miss them every day. And we mourn for the injustice in the system that allowed this preventable tragedy to occur. In their memories, let us recommit ourselves to the collective struggle for safe, healthy and just workplaces.

Rashadul Alam Raju, Executive Member, IndustiAll Bangladesh Council (IBC) and General Secretary, Bangladesh Independent Garment Workers Union Federation (BIGUF)

Despite numerous initiatives taken after the Rana Plaza tragedy, there are still obstacles hindering the improvement of workers' situation in Bangladesh. Workers who attempt to unionize are being blacklisted from the Workers' Database, preventing them from securing employment elsewhere. Safety committees established in most factories do not adhere to regulations and have limited scope for workers to voice their concerns. The replacement of Accord with RSC has not produced expected results, with RSC failing to take a neutral stance and taking a long time to address complaints. The process for registering a trade union has become lengthy, with only a small group being selected while others face harassment. Communication between unions and workers is lacking, hindering their performance. To address these issues, a productive working relationship between owners and workers is needed, with active participation and proper representation of workers. Freedom of Association and workers' representation must be prioritised, and union registrations and complaints should be processed in a timely manner. The process of forming trade unions should be transparent. RSC's effectiveness should also be improved.

Peter D. Haas, United States Ambassador to Bangladesh

Rana Plaza drew the world's attention to the unsafe conditions for Bangladesh's factory workers and raised important questions around safety and transparency in the global garments industry. Today, garments factories in the export sector are safer due to agreements among unions, global brands, and employers who work together under the former Accord and Alliance.

Bangladesh has digitized the trade union registration process, which will help workers form unions and complete their registrations. They've also digitized the labour inspection section to improve data accessibility and transparency. In order to become a SMART, developed Bangladesh, workers' safety and labor rights will need to be ingrained in Bangladesh's ethos. In that regard, here are three areas where Bangladesh might focus moving forward:

First, Bangladesh should seek to replicate its progress in industrial safety in the export-orientated RMG sector throughout the entire economy. We are all aware of the recent fire outbreak in Bangabazar, explosion at the Seema Oxygen Plant, the fire at a container depot in Chittagong, and the Hasheem Food factory fire. These examples illustrate the need for stronger inspections and enforcement of labour laws across all industry sectors.

Second, Bangladesh should further strengthen the right of workers to form and join independent trade unions and to collectively bargain for better work conditions. The rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining are enabling rights for the realization of all other labour rights. When workers can form or join independent unions, they can defend their rights and collectively advance their interests. In fact, the decrease in work-related accidents in the industrialized world is largely due to the courageous efforts of organised labour. Unionized workers are empowered to negotiate conditions more equally with employers, demand better wages, and challenge unsafe working conditions. Unions also play a key role in advancing democratic values at the workplace. Workers must also have access to remedies for labour and safety violations. Collective bargaining agreements can protect workers who refuse precarious work assignments or confront management on health and safety concerns.

And third, all stakeholders must be held accountable for workplace safety and labour rights, as improving occupational safety and health and labour rights is a shared responsibility. Governments, manufacturers, brands, buyers, workers, unions, and consumers all have a critical role to play in ensuring that goods are produced safely and that everyone in the process earns a fair return. Governments must play a critical role in developing strong labour protections and ensuring that they are respected. Manufacturers must prioritise keeping their workers safe and finding ways to collaborate with their workforce. International brands and buyers must do more to demand that labour rights are respected throughout their supply chains. This means adopting purchasing and pricing strategies that support living wages and promote high labour standards among their suppliers. Workers and their unions must advocate for their rights transparently and peacefully, and consumers must be mindful of the working conditions of the people they buy from.

Anwar Hossain, Chairman of National Coordination Committee for Workers' Education (NCCWE) & President of Bangladesh Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal (BJSD)

Bangladesh must prioritise the establishment of strong and independent trade unions to facilitate constructive dialogue between workers and employers. The absence of such unions has been a major obstacle in resolving disputes and addressing issues in the past, as evidenced by the tragic Rana Plaza incident. Empowering workers with the right to collective bargaining and freedom of association will allow them to voice their concerns and negotiate for better working conditions. Strengthening workers' rights through the formation of robust trade unions is crucial for a safer and fairer workplace environment in Bangladesh.

Razequzzaman Ratan, President of Samajtantrik Sramik Front (SSF)

The tragedy at Rana Plaza highlighted the critical need for functioning trade unions in Bangladesh, one that can effectively represent and advocate for workers' rights. Currently, there are over 9,000 trade unions in the country, but many are either dysfunctional or too afraid to stand up for workers' interests.

The monitoring system in place prior to the disaster was inadequate, with 218 significant incidents occurring before the Rana Plaza collapse, and major troubles persisting even after the event. For example, just one month before the Shezan factory fire, the factory had been given a satisfactory rating during monitoring. Despite an increase in the number of factory inspectors from 92 to 393 and upgrades to their equipment, the safety at factories remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, there is no accountability for inspectors after such incidents.

There are no dedicated hospitals for workers in industrial areas. There are also no provisions for the rehabilitation of injured workers and their return to work have not been addressed.

The maximum penalty of four years of imprisonment for those responsible for factory catastrophes is farcical and does not reflect the severity of the situation.

Nazma Yesmin, Director of Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS)

The Rana Plaza incident claimed the lives of 1,138 workers, yet there has been no significant policy-level change since then. When the labour law was amended in 2018, many labour rights were curtailed, especially maternity benefits for female workers.

The current draft should ensure a worker's compensation in any trouble, in line with ILO Convention 121 and serious injury provision 155. The victims of Rana Plaza are traumatised and unable to return to work; their mental health treatment should be addressed adequately. Although they received initial treatments, they were not compensated at later stages. These are their rights, not favours.

Chandan Kumar Dey, President of Bangladesh Independent Garment Workers' Union Federation (BIGUF)

Since the Accord was forced to leave the country, the situation in garment factories has regressed, resembling the conditions that led to the Rana Plaza disaster. Safety inspections have become perfunctory and do not adequately address legitimate safety concerns. Moreover, information about the safety conditions of factories, including fire safety and building codes, is not readily available. We propose the appointment of a permanent safety supervisor in all factories to ensure compliance with safety measures, such as checking fire extinguishers and keeping emergency exits clear. Genuine trade union workers should be allowed to engage in collective bargaining, given the worsening work conditions in EPZs.

Ruhul Amin, President of Bangladesh Federation of Workers' Solidarity (BFWS)

Unfortunately, we have seen a shift from bargaining to negotiations and social dialogues in recent years, despite the absence of any provisions for these in our labour laws. As a result, our collective bargaining power has diminished, leaving our 1,200 trade unions with a little capacity to negotiate effectively on behalf of workers. These unions are often established and led by owners and worker representatives who do not genuinely represent the interests of garment workers.

China Rahman, General Secretary of Federation of Garments Workers (FGW)

The Accord has made significant strides, particularly in the areas of building and fire safety, as well as addressing workers' health and bargaining issues. However, the reinstatement of Accord International is necessary to ensure the sustainability of Bangladesh's RMG sector.

Women employees face several challenges, including a lack of childcare facilities, restrictions on continuing work after having two children, and frequent harassment for joining trade unions. As a result, the number of women workers in the RMG sector is declining.

Advocate Faruq Hossain, Assistant Legal Officer, Safety & Rights Society

The tragedy at Rana Plaza highlighted the inadequacy of our rescue capabilities, necessitating a critical assessment of our advancements in this domain. Additionally, given the higher safety risks associated with taller industrial buildings, it is imperative that we deliberate on imposing limitations on their height to ensure the safety and well-being of workers.

Kawsar Ahmed Polash, President of the United Federation of Garments Workers

Previously, according to labour laws, workers were required to join an industry if it was relocated within five kilometres. However, the provision has been amended to 40 kilometres, and workers who do not join the new location will not receive their service benefits. This is a blatant infringement of labour rights.

During industrial unrest, the workers are often held responsible without identifying the root cause of the unrest.

Mohamad Anis Agung Nugroho, Programme Manager, International Labour Organization (ILO)

In the process of amending labour laws, including the EPZ law, the involvement of trade unions is crucial. Currently, the ILO is preparing a technical note on these amendments, and I am confident that trade union members will actively contribute their input to this process.

The RMG sector has witnessed a significant improvement in occupational safety and health. However, there has been a recent increase in non-compliance, and the grievance redressal mechanism has been on the decline.

Out of the 440 factories where the ILO's Better Work programme is implemented, 147 of them have registered trade unions according to the Department of Labour's website. However, during our factory visits, we were only able to meet with the executive committee of 56 factories, leaving 91 factories on the Department of Labour's trade union list where we were unable to identify or meet their executive committees. And out of the 56 factories, only seven had collective bargaining agreements.

Amirul Haque Amin, President, IndustriAll Bangladesh Council (IBC)

The Rana Plaza incident is often labelled as an ""accident,"" but it was actually a murder. The workers had identified cracks in the building and refused to work there, but they were coerced into joining the factory. Therefore, I believe it is necessary to take a firm stance on the matter.

We are aware that crores of taka were donated to the Rana Plaza Trust fund. It is imperative for the government to reveal how the funds have been utilised.

There were 31 brands that had orders in the five factories of Rana Plaza. Following the incident, 19 of these brands contributed to the Rana Plaza fund, while 12 did not including Walmart. These 12 brands are still operational in Bangladesh, yet we have failed to take any action against them. It is unfortunate that only 46 brands have signed the International Accord.

Finally, we must ensure that workers can exercise their right to organise, strike, and bargain without any hindrance.

AKM Nasim, Country Program Director, Solidarity Center- Bangladesh office

The representation of workers is in jeopardy, as many unions often exist only in names. There is no effective participation of workers in safety committees also. The ongoing effort of many to replace the unions' rights of collecting bargaining with so-called social dialogue is detrimental to the interest of the workers.

We have been discussing the need to reform labour laws, which presents an opportunity to address these issues. We also need to ensure the implementation of national labour laws in EPZs. The workers of newly established Economic Zones (EZs) are also deprived of the freedom of association rights as the EPZ labour law is applicable to them, not the national labour law. If we can ensure workers' rights to organise and collective bargaining, and safety in every workplace, it will be a fitting tribute to those who lost their lives in industrial disasters such as Rana Plaza.

Tanjim Ferdous, In-charge of NGO and Foreign Missions at the Business Development Team, The Daily Star, & Moderator of the session

Undoubtedly, the garment sector is one of the most significant economic drivers in Bangladesh, primarily due to the availability of easily accessible labour. However, the industry's failure to prioritize the safety and well-being of its workers has resulted in numerous hazardous incidents, predominantly fire outbreaks. The collapse of Rana Plaza in Savar on 24 April 2013 resulted in the death of 1,135 people and injuries to 2,500 others. Subsequently, efforts were made to enhance compliances within the sector. Thanks to the support of donor agencies, labour unions, and national-level organisations, notable progress has been made. This discussion centres around evaluating the improvements made in the labour conditions over the past decade and exploring further avenues for improvement.

545,Transforming Agrifood Systems to Improve Nutrition in Secondary Cities: The Role of Women,"Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture (SFSA) organized a roundtable discussion regarding the role of women in transforming agrifood systems to improve nutrition in secondary cities on 9 March 2023. The event was hosted by Nutrition in City Ecosystem (NICE), a project of Swiss public and private consortium of Swiss TPH, ETH Zurich, Sight and Life and SFSA under the Global Food Security program of Swiss Development and Cooperation (SDC).

Farhad Zamil, Country Director, Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture Bangladesh

The agrifood system relies heavily on women, who serve as the backbone of the rural economy. Despite their pivotal role, women encounter various obstacles, such as inadequate access to resources, technologies, and market information. If these challenges are addressed and women are empowered, the agrifood sector can be transformed. This will lead to improved food security, nutrition, and progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. Transforming agrifood systems to improve nutrition is possible with the critical and collaborative efforts of numerous stakeholders. By adopting best practices and sharing experiences, they can work together to achieve the desired outcomes.

The Syngenta Foundation recognizes the value of coalition-building and multi-stakeholder involvement, including the representation of women and young people, in facilitating systemic change in food and nutrition systems. This field is highly complex, and it can sometimes be difficult to identify the right direction. We are willing to work tirelessly to improve urban nutrition through transformed agrifood systems. I expect this discussion to be centered around exploring policies and strategies that can bolster the position of women in the agrifood system and boost nutrition in secondary cities.

Corinne Henchoz Pignani, Deputy Head of Cooperation, Embassy of Switzerland in Bangladesh

Switzerland has developed the Bangladesh Country Program 2022-25, which is aligned with the eighth five-year plan and aims to support the country as it prepares to graduate smoothly and sustainably from the LDC category in 2026. To achieve joint commitments towards Agenda 2030 and Leave No One Behind, the cooperation program of Switzerland in Bangladesh focuses on two main outcomes: sustainable and more inclusive economic development and social wellbeing for all; and three transversal outcomes: gender and social inclusion, climate change and environment and governance.

While Bangladesh has a successful development story, many challenges remain, including feeding the increasing population in urban centers, improving production, enhancing connectivity, diversifying food options, while keeping prices under control. The Nutrition in City Ecosystems (NICE) project, supported by Switzerland, aims to address these challenges by focusing on secondary cities, the role of local and national governments in the food system, the private sector's partnership, and ensuring farmers have sustainable and healthy farms.

By bringing stakeholders together and focusing on the critical role of the state in policy, guidelines, and infrastructure regarding food security, we can achieve a more inclusive and sustainable food system in Bangladesh.

Dr Helen Prytherch, Head of Health Systems Unit, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute

The NICE project started in 2021. We focus on secondary cities facing the double burden of malnutrition that exists in many urban areas.

The project is co-financed by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and consortium partners. This multi-country program is working in Rwanda, Kenya and Bangladesh. In each of these countries, two secondary cities are involved. The main partner of the project is the local government. In Bangladesh, we are working with the city corporation of Rangpur and the municipality of Dinajpur.

The NICE project has three main workstreams. The first one is improving the governance of urban food systems. It involves working with multisectoral platforms at the local government level to make them more inclusive by engaging civil society organizations and ensuring access for women, farmers and youth groups to discuss their concerns. We also have a strong collaboration with FAO and other countries on the concept of urban food systems.

The second workstream focuses on production and demand, including a participatory selection of value chains with city-level actors and leveraging the expertise of the social business model of the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture's Farmers' hub. The aim is to increase the availability of nutritious and quality food, while also increasing knowledge and demand for nutritious diets. Efforts include bringing products to markets, working with consumers who have purchasing power, engaging with the education sector, and reaching more vulnerable populations through the public procurement system.

The third workstream aims to improve data availability and promote peer learning between cities, and countries. Finally, the project seeks to increase influence policy at the secondary city level, feeding this back to the national level for wider dissemination. We focus on cross-cutting issues, youth engagement, and women empowerment to ensure their fair involvement across the food system e.g. in production, food processing, and selling. The male-dominated agricultural sector requires strong efforts to ensure women are involved also trainings and income-generating activities.

Arif Hossain, CEO, Farming Future Bangladesh & Moderator of the session

Since achieving independence, Bangladesh has made significant strides in livestock, farming technologies, and irrigation, leading to the country's ability to now export food. However, there are still areas that require attention, such as investing in the next generation of educated farmers who can contribute to the agricultural scene using advanced knowledge of social media and newer technologies. The private sector needs to support the capacity building of smallholder farmers. The issues of transparency and accountability need to be addressed, such as fair pricing and access to inputs.

Despite women's efforts in their fields and households, their contributions are often not recognised, which impacts their food intake, nutrition, healthcare of their children, and overall development and sustainability. Women need more support in land ownership, credit access, technology and training, and changing social norms. Government policies need to become more inclusive to give women better access to the resources they need.

Syeda Zinia Rashid, Senior Programme Officer, Embassy of Switzerland in Bangladesh

Women are involved in every type of agricultural activity, putting in as many hours than men. Women participate in crop production activities, ranging from preparation of land for production to harvesting and processing of the crops. Particularly women are traditionally involved in homestead vegetable cultivation, livestock rearing and fisheries management. Their engagement in agriculture and food production activities improves socio-economic conditions by increasing household food security, family nutrition and employment opportunities. But all their roles are little appreciated and valued. As an example, women comprise 50-60% of the farm labour force in Bangladesh, they still face significant challenges in accessing resources, services, inputs, and production assets such as land and livestock, compared to their male counterparts. This gender gap is a critical issue that must be addressed to empower women farmers to fully utilize their resources and have agency over their income.

A 17-month pilot study conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the Ministry of Agriculture in 2019 found that when women and men in a household receive combo training on farm production, nutrition, and gender sensitivity, agricultural and dietary diversity significantly increases, along with economic returns. The Food and Agricultural Organization has also reported that if the women in agriculture sector in developing countries can have equal access to productive resources, opportunities, and technology-based training, could increase farm yield by 20-30%, raise total agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5–4%, which could in turn reduce the number of hungry people in the world by 12–17%.

Alessandra Roversi, Programme Officer, SDC

Examining the contributions of women through the lens of the food system would be fascinating, as they make valuable contributions not only to food production but also to decision-making in many other areas such as food consumption (what the family can or should buy) and in other services such as financial institutions that provide agricultural loans.

Recognizing schools as an important platform to provide healthy and sustainable food and for fostering awareness about the importance of choosing healthy and sustainable food ingredients for families, the NICE project collaborates with educators. In this endeavor, the health, food, agriculture and economic development sectors all have crucial roles to play.

When examining the involvement of women in food system governance, it is crucial to consider that our food can originate from both local fields and national and international value chains. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the entire food environment is necessary to understand how women can effectively participate in this aspect of governance.

Klaus Kraemer, President, Sight and Life

Malnutrition dispropor-tionately affects women in Bangladesh, with alarming rates of anemia (30%), zinc deficiency (almost 50%), and vitamin D deficiency (70%). Women require a well-balanced diet including vitamins and minerals (micronutrients), proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, to maintain optimum health.

It is crucial to support women's health needs fully since malnutrition has intergenerational consequences. A malnourished and stunted mother is more likely to give birth to a stunted child, causing increased child morbidity and mortality. Then, in rural and semi-urban areas, women frequently act as breadwinners apart from managing the household, often running small agriculture-based businesses. This means their health will impact future human capital as well. Therefore, we must focus on the first 1,000 days, from conception to a child's second birthday, to optimize nutrition during this critical period.

Pregnant women require an adequate diet, micronutrient supplements, and should exclusively breastfeed children for six months followed by the introduction of nutrient dense complementary foods and continued breastfeeding.

U S Rokeya Akhter, National Gender Specialist, FAO

According to a recent study, women farmers in Bangladesh do not identify themselves as farmers but as helpers to their male family members. The study suggests that land ownership is a crucial factor in women recognizing themselves as farmers.

Women farmers in slum areas hold great promise as they utilize natural methods to produce fertilizers without the use of pesticides for their families and communities. These women farmers require support to enhance their farming techniques. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) provides technological training and assistance to more than 55 farmers' associations, including women-led cooperatives, through digital village centers. These training sessions improve their agricultural production and marketing skills. Additionally, technological support should be provided to women entrepreneurs. They have shown their potential during the COVID-19 pandemic by selling their products online.

It is crucial to ensure that school-going children and adolescent girls receive adequate nutrition, and implementing a meal system in schools is necessary, particularly in cities and slum areas. A government program that encourages children to grow vegetables and fruits in their schools can help to ensure sufficient nutrition in these areas.

Pedro Andres Garzon Delvaux, Food System Policy Economist, FAO

The defining moment will be determined by our food consumption patterns. With a significant portion of the population in Bangladesh projected to be living in urban areas in the near future, women working in rural areas will no longer be the defining reality of most women. Therefore, it is crucial for these women that alternative opportunities such as retailing spaces are explored. However, the number of women involved in the agri-food retail sector in Bangladesh is limited. Moreover, in many markets, the proportion of women directly purchasing food can be very low. These changes necessitate a serious reconsideration of our approach. As our food consumption habits continue to evolve towards more prepared foods, there is a great opportunity for women to play a significant role in food preparation and the agro-food sector as a whole.

Understanding governance is crucial in the context of the food system because no single institution or stakeholder can address the existing problems alone. Therefore, there is a need for a platform that facilitates connections between different actors, ranging from farmers to supermarkets.

Md Shahid Uddin Akbar, CEO, BIID

We recognize the crucial role of women in the agri-food sector and approach it from three perspectives. Firstly, we see adolescent girls as drivers of food demand. By encouraging them to prioritize nutritious food, we can bridge the nutrition gap while simultaneously increasing their knowledge of nutrition. Secondly, we acknowledge women as agricultural entrepreneurs who have access to credit facilities but often lack the necessary banking knowledge to benefit from them. We need to provide capacity-building training to ensure they can effectively utilize these resources. Lastly, we understand that women typically lead household food-related decisions and must be equipped with the knowledge and skills to make informed choices.

We need to make nutrition education engaging for children so that they can learn through demonstration and become invested in the topic.

Simon Winter, Executive Director, Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture

Improving city nutrition is crucial. Achieving this requires innovative approaches that make healthy food more accessible and increase awareness of its nutritional content. In this context, it is essential to empower women, for example by encouraging their entrepreneurship. The NICE program supports women in establishing food businesses in cities and Farmers' Hubs in rural areas. We aim to have women running 40% of these Hubs. NICE also targets 40,000 vulnerable low-income consumers, 40% of them women.

It is not enough just to talk about these changes; we must ensure they are implemented and establish transparency and accountability mechanisms to verify progress. We must ensure that women have adequate representation at all levels, including municipal coordination committees, program leadership, and decision-making roles. Women should have the opportunity to become leaders, mentors and coaches for entrepreneurs in the program and have the power to take decisions.

Policy changes should support entrepreneurship development, internship programs, and employability programs that strengthen the food system. Women's groups should hold the public sector accountable for policy changes. We need to share these initiatives with local stakeholders and receive feedback, especially on women's representation. We listen to stakeholders across the public and private sectors; we use their feedback to drive policy change. In addition, we need to use social media more to engage consumers and support healthy dietary choices.

We constantly assess our initiatives and identify areas for improvement. This flexible learning approach encourages innovation, new partnerships and sustainable long-term solutions. The NICE program is currently set to run for four years in Bangladesh, Rwanda and Kenya. We have plans to double that length and increase the scope. We aim to scale up the program within today's focus cities of Rangpur and Dinajpur, and in due time expand it both within Bangladesh and abroad.

546,"Changing mindsets, changing lives: The power of social norms programming in ending child marriage","Care Bangladesh in association with The Daily Star organized a roundtable titled ""Impact of Social Norms Programming"" on February 28, 2023. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Ramesh Singh, Country Director, CARE Bangladesh

Bangladesh has made significant progress in the last fifty years, and it is on the brink of transitioning from a least-developed country to a middle-income country. However, there are still challenges, such as inequalities of opportunities and pressing issues like Child, Early, and Forced Marriage (CEFM) that need to be addressed.

Instead of just gathering evidence, we need to focus on generating ideas for action. By applying lessons learned from successful initiatives such as Tipping Point Initiative and implementing them effectively, we can reduce the risk of the child, early, and forced marriages by 63%, with further improvements possible.

These evidence-based insights should be integrated into regular programmes, as specific gender programming alone cannot address the larger issue of gender, particularly with child and forced marriages. These components need to be incorporated into various activities, including humanitarian efforts.

Golam Mortaza, Editor, The Daily Star Bangla

Bangladesh's position in terms of the prevalence of child marriage is extremely concerning. However, it is undeniable that progress has been made in both the government and non-government sectors in addressing this issue. Overcoming such obstacles is challenging, particularly when norms and religious beliefs are involved and people are hesitant to discuss the issue.

Mahmudur Rahman Khan, Technical Coordinator- Research, M&E, Tipping Point Initiative, CARE Bangladesh:

Tipping Point Initiative started in 2013, aiming to identify the root causes and normative expectations behind child, early and forced marriages. The programme seeks to address the issue by engaging with communities and advocating for change. It has successfully engaged with local governments, religious leaders, influential individuals in the community, and families.

The Tipping Point Initiative identified four key norms that contribute to the problem of child marriage: 1) girls' mobility, 2) girls' decision-making power about their marriage, 3) girls' interaction with young boys in their community, and 4) the ability to go to collective action. The programme found that the imposition of normative expectations in these key areas makes it challenging for girls to realize their full potential, ultimately leading to child marriage. The programme is working to challenge these norms using the components of social norms.

In the second phase of the implementation, through 40 sessions, the programme has encouraged discussions about normative roles and initiated changes in mindsets. We involved girls in the decision-making process and empowered them to take the lead. During the second phase, the Tipping Point engaged iccdr,b as a research partner to design and conduct the Randomized Control Trial (RCT) involving 51 villages into three segments (17 villages each). The assessment took place after a 10-month freeze period to allow social norms to set in and have an impact on the community. The main result was that the Tipping Point Initiative reduced the hazard of child marriage for adolescent girls by 63% who attended more than 36 of the 40 sessions. The Initiative has seen positive changes in girls' mobility, self-efficacy, decision-making skills, negotiation skills, attitude towards social norms, knowledge of sexual health, decreased rates of violence and abuse.

The Initiative has noticed changes in parental mindset, with parents now more open to taking girls' wishes and aspirations into consideration when arranging marriages. The programme has also noticed fewer restrictions on girls' interactions with male peers in the community. Furthermore, the program has helped change gender roles and expectations, with girls now expecting non-traditional roles and wanting to participate in outdoor games. Girls' mobility has increased significantly, with riding bicycles for schooling and visiting relatives.

The Tipping Point Initiative's integration of social norms as an approach to address child marriage requires at least 36 weekly sessions or more to get positive results. The programme has shown positive changes in basic interventions as well. However, changing deeply entrenched social norms takes time and continuous efforts.

Rawnak Jahan, Director (Acting), WGEP of CARE Bangladesh.

Every sector should work together to effectively address and combat issues like- CEFM in an integrated way focusing on the social norms, ensuring gender-transformative services regardless of age, and roles towards girl-centric services and interventions. We need focused discussions and make a conscious effort in accessing all pertinent information, and services. By taking action and working collectively, we can make a positive shift on this critical issues.

Md Nasir Uddin, Deputy Director, Social Welfare Services

Changing social norms may seem difficult, but gradual progress is possible through collective efforts. Instead of simply reporting on the number of child marriages that have been prevented each year, we should aim to release a report demonstrating a complete eradication of child marriage.The textbook concepts targeting adolescents should not be left stapled but actively taught by teachers. Religious leaders can also play a crucial role in educating people on social norms.

In addition, we can work with our women's football team to help them improve and raise awareness for the cause.

Tahera Jabeen, Social Development Adviser, British High Commission Dhaka

Child marriage cannot be addressed in isolation; we must tackle other related issues as well, such as promoting inclusive economic growth and gender-responsive social assistance. Policies should prioritise and invest in quality education, especially secondary education that focuses on skill development. We also need to scale up measures to support married adolescents. To effectively address child marriage, we must identify prevailing social norms and work towards changing them in a context-specific manner that should collaborate with religious institutions, while in others, more focus on mobility or decision-making skills may be required.

Evidence-based scaling up is vital for creating long-term change. While Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) have their merits, their limitations need to be addressed. International organisations should collaborate and share their learnings to implement best practices and think about tools which would be more appropriate to measure qualitative outcomes such as social norms change.

Kamrun Nahar Dolly, Assistant Director and Information Officer, Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE)

The education sector has witnessed a rise in girls' participation at the secondary level, which is now at 54%, thanks to various interventions, including the provision of stipends. Another successful intervention was the establishment of adolescent corners by the DSHE, where teenagers received education on SRHR topics. This initiative led to a decrease in the dropout rate, child marriages, and gender-based violence in those areas. Recently, the directorate issued a letter instructing the activation of school committees to tackle sexual harassment.

In rural and underserved areas where child marriage is prevalent due to poverty and hopelessness, offering soft loans to girl students can financially empower them, leading to a reduction in child marriages.

Nobonita Chowdhury, Director, Preventing Violence Against Women Initiative, BRAC

In order to prevent harmful practices like child marriage, it is necessary to continuously work toward changing social norms. Collaborative efforts between government organizations (GOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been successful in bringing about change by encouraging community acceptance of birth control methods, sending girls to school, and teaching practical skills like preparing saline. However, in order to overcome centuries of entrenched beliefs and norms surrounding child marriage, the community must see tangible benefits and examples of the positive effects of changing social norms.

Both GOs and NGOs have individual programs aimed at enhancing girls' capacity and skills, but it is crucial to ensure that girls who are at the highest risk of early marriage are participating in these programmes.

Dr Md Jahangir Alam Prodhan, Deputy Director, MCH, DGFP

The family planning department has been a trailblazer in adolescent healthcare in Bangladesh. The department has developed strategies and action plans for reproductive health, and is working towards the goal of zero gender-based violence by 2041, as committed by the Prime Minister in 2019.

We have established 1203 corners across the country to provide counseling and support to adolescent girls. Life-skills programmes are also being implemented in all districts with the involvement of stakeholders. In addition, premarital, preconception, and post-marital spacing counseling services are being provided. Through these efforts, we are striving to promote the well-being of adolescent girls in Bangladesh and combat harmful social norms.

Umme Sanjida, Tipping Point Activist Girl, Rangpur

The Tipping Point Initiative has completely transformed my life. The most significant change for me has been my newfound ability to speak up and converse with anyone in the village. Through my actions, other young girls including women have come to understand the harmful consequences of early child marriage. The practice of falsifying their daughter's age to justify early marriage must be eliminated.

Paola Castro Neiderstam, Program Specialist - Human Rights, Democracy and Gender Equality, Embassy of Sweden

Child marriage is a byproduct of gender inequality, disproportionately affecting young girls. This form of violence violates fundamental child and women's rights. Ironically, in some cases, child marriage is seen as a protective measure by parents, but research suggests this is not the case. We need to understand why child marriage occurs and address harmful social and cultural norms.

Bangladesh has made strides in addressing gender equality, but there is also a need to invest in setting up a strong child protection system. Having a skilled professional social worker workforce is crucial to protect girls when society fails to do so.

Dr. Muhammad Munir Hussain, Program Analyst- A&Y, UNFPA

Acknowledging that child marriage rates are not decreasing, we must recognise the importance of innovation if we wish to break this pattern.

Some parents may still intend to marry off their children early. To combat this problem, we must focus not only on providing knowledge but also on developing skills that empower individuals to take actions. With increased funding and resources, both government entities and NGOs can work collaboratively to address the challenging issue of child marriage.

Hanufa Akhter, Tipping Point Activist Girl, Rangpur

I joined the Tipping Point activities and discovered that we were only receiving 10% of our entitled services. After attending sessions, we shared our knowledge and others became aware of our rights. Playing football and seeing our fathers cook were things we never thought would happen. Two men even pledged to stop charging their wives for cooking. Initially, the local chairman, members, and Imam were not interested, but now they warmly acknowledge our success.

I believe that the mental fortitude of parents is key to eradicating child marriage in our society. Unfortunately, some girls I know have already been married and they are younger than me. When their relatives boasted about their marriages and children, my mother stood up for me. Thanks to my involvement with the Tipping Point Initiative, my mother now trusts me more than ever before.

Bridget Job-Johnson, The Chief of Social and Behavioral Changed Section, UNICEF

A whole-society approach is necessary to address child marriage, as religion, culture, and values are closely intertwined with this issue. We cannot afford to leave out certain sections of the population, such as religious leaders, who play a crucial role in society. To achieve this, we must learn from successful experiences of closely working with them.

Despite the presence of many educated women in the country, the prevailing narrative still considers women to be confined to their homes, which needs to be challenged through gender-transformative actions.

It is crucial to address the supply-demand chain of child marriage, as men and boys in Bangladesh often marry young girls for dowry and employment opportunities, but lack the necessary business knowledge which leads to violence and eventual failure. A human-centered design approach involving the common people can lead to better solutions.

We must broaden our focus beyond adolescent girls and involve boys in addressing child marriage. Additionally, parents play a significant role and need to understand their children's needs and how to respond to them. Providing parenting skills, including the ability to talk about sex and sexuality, is also essential.

Humaira Farhanaz, Programme Analyst - Gender, Adolescent & Youth, UNFPA

In Bangladesh, the child marriage rate remains at a concerning 51%. UNFPA recognizes the urgent need to prioritize support for married adolescent girls, as preventing adolescent pregnancy is a critical focus area for our organization.

We strongly believe that marriage should not end a girl's opportunities for growth and development. Equipping them with knowledge about where to seek support can also help to delay age at marriage and consequently their first pregnancy.

Belal Uddin, Technical Advisor, SBC, Program Quality & Development, Save the Children

While we possess knowledge of both the problems and solutions related to adolescents, there seems to be gaps in delivering effective solutions. It is essential to identify the reasons behind implementation gaps.

At Save the Children, we acknowledge that adolescent issues are cross-cutting. Therefore, we aim to take a holistic approach to address the issues across all our interventions. We prioritize girls' issues while also ensuring that boys are not left out of the conversation.

M A Akher, Director Planning, Department of Youth Development

With over 18,500 youth clubs spanning the country, 6,000 of which are registered with us, we have the opportunity to utilize their efforts in addressing the issue of child marriage.

According to our 2017 youth policy, individuals between the ages of 18 and 35 are considered youth, and our youth department works towards serving their needs. Unfortunately, 51% girls who marry before the age of 18 do not receive support from various youth initiatives, and are classified as NEET (Not in Employment, Education, or Training). As part of the Five-Year Plan, the government has set a target of reducing the NEET population to 5%. Additionally, in collaboration with relevant industries, we will offer training opportunities to support their development. Our youth training centers, located in 64 districts, dedicate 10% of their classes towards inspiring young girls to pursue education and enter the workforce.

Sakina Sultana, Team Leader, Tipping Point Initiative, CARE Bangladesh

I would like to express my gratitude for your robust participation and valuable recommendations. I firmly believe that CARE Bangladesh has received important guidance for its future programming through your insights and suggestions.

Tanjim Ferdous, In-Charge, NGOs & Foreign Missions section of the Business Development team, The Daily Star & Moderator of the session

According to a Girls Not Brides survey, a staggering 59% of adolescent girls in Bangladesh are affected by child marriage. Even more alarming is the fact that 22% of these girls are married off before they reach the age of 15. CARE has identified various societal factors that must be addressed in order to prevent child marriage. It's not just parents, poverty, or the COVID situation that are to blame, but also the broader societal norms.

547,Kidney patients are at higher risk of unexpected disasters,"On March 4, 2023, the Kidney Awareness Monitoring & Prevention Society (KAMPS), with the support of Eskayef Pharmaceuticals Limited, organised a roundtable titled “Kidney patients are at higher risk of unexpected disasters”. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Dr M.A.Samad, President KAMPS, Professor and Head, Department of Nephrology, Anwar Khan Modern Medical College and Hospital

The overwhelming majority of dialysis facilities in Bangladesh, precisely 95% of the total 215 centers, are located in urban regions. Consequently, residents of Cox's Bazar face the daunting task of travelling 90km to Chittagong to receive vital dialysis treatment. This distance becomes insurmountable during disasters when transportation is disrupted, leading to dire consequences. Similar picture is seen throughout our country. To ensure kidney health for all during emergencies, we need to take proactive measures.

Treatment of kidney failure is highly expensive. Therefore, let's raise the slogan ""Kidney Health for All"". Dialysis and Transplant service must be provided free of cost under universal health care.

One solution is for policymakers to introduce mobile dialysis centres, making the service more widely available during disasters. Additionally, doctors must take on responsibilities such as preparing patients mentally, creating emergency kits, and ensuring medicine and other essentials are available. Chronic patients should be registered to receive necessary treatments in emergencies. Journalists can also play a crucial role in raising awareness among patients, so they can make necessary preparations.

At-risk patients can prepare their emergency kits and gather information about alternative dialysis centres in advance. They should also establish a network of supportive individuals, including friends and family, who can assist them during times of need. Finally, patients should be informed about dos and don'ts during emergencies to prevent complications.

Dr Mehedi Ahmed Ansari, Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, BUET

It is imperative that the government takes proactive measures to assess the safety of all buildings, particularly medical and dialysis centers, in preparation for earthquakes. Those identified as at-risk should be strengthened accordingly. Earthquake signals often provide little time to evacuate, making strong and sturdy buildings crucial in providing protection for occupants.

In this regard, preparedness is paramount, with ensuring medical centers are earthquake-resistant taking priority. Anchoring medical equipment to the floor is also crucial as part of preparatory measures.

The northeast region of Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes, and hospitals built on unstable land should receive special attention to ensure their safety.

Dr Abdul Latif Hilali, Director of Program, Urban Resilience Program, RAJUK

We should start working on field-level projects to minimize the risk of earthquakes. The Bangladesh Urban Earthquake Resilience project, in collaboration with the World Bank, is a proactive government project aimed at achieving this goal. As part of the Earthquake Disaster Risk Reduction, a total of 3,252 buildings, including schools, colleges, and hospitals, were assessed on a priority basis. Of these, 42 buildings need to be demolished, while the rest remain vulnerable.

We have also developed a risk-sensitive land-use plan for Dhaka and a filled and sandy soil area map. Another project we initiated is the electronic construction permitting system, which enables floor-by-floor supervision without deviation, placing utmost importance on structural design. Additionally, we provided earthquake training to 1,200 engineers through 12 national and international professors.

To further minimize earthquake risk, we must be more vigilant in constructing and retrofitting buildings to withstand at least eight magnitudes of earthquakes. New constructions should adhere to the Bangladesh National Building Code, while older buildings should undergo retrofits following proper assessment. With gradual interventions, we can effectively mitigate the risk of earthquakes.

Professor Dr. Harun Ur Rashid, President, Kidney Foundation

The cure for acute kidney failure lies in providing immediate treatment, which can cure 80% of the disease. However, for those who suffer from gradual kidney damage, creating awareness is crucial. As chronic kidney disease often goes undetected, with no symptoms 80% of the time, 50% of patients are unaware they have the disease until it's too late. It is recommended that individuals over the age of 40-45 get their urine tested by a doctor every year, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not. Additionally, monitoring blood pressure, weight, and glucose at home can be beneficial. With blood pressure monitors costing only 150 BDT, testing blood pressure at home is affordable and easy. Individuals with blood pressure exceeding 140/90 must visit a healthcare center for a serum creatinine test and consult a nephrologist if the result is close to 1.2 ml.

Unfortunately, Bangladesh does not have enough nephrologists to treat everyone. To combat this issue, governmental and non-governmental organizations need to train more nephrologists, renal-care physicians, and nurses to test and treat kidney disease. Additionally, more non-governmental organizations like KAMPS need to be established to provide low-cost testing and treatment for kidney failure. Creating awareness among the public is also crucial.

Brigadier General Engineer Ali Ahmed Khan, Former Director General, Department of Fire Service and Civil Defense

An effective emergency response plan is crucial in preparing for natural disasters. To ensure that we can save lives, we need open spaces, well-stocked blood banks, and mobile hospitals set up in and outside of Dhaka, in collaboration with stakeholders such as medical associations. Adequate preparation is necessary, and doctors must receive better training to support emergency response efforts.

The role of nearby hospitals, like Enam Medical College & Hospital, was critical during the Rana Plaza tragedy. In addition, a National Emergency Medical Center should be established. Hospitals require an emergency response plan, properly trained medical staff, and well-equipped facilities to provide assistance during crises. With the support of the Disaster Ministry, doctors and nurses must play a vital role in providing aid during medical rescue operations.

Engineer Iqbal Habib, Joint Secretary, BAPA

Dhaka and other urban cities in Bangladesh are at a higher risk of natural disasters compared to countries like Turkey and Syria, which have recently experienced large-scale disasters.

A recent survey revealed that 187 hospitals, schools, and colleges are at extreme risk, with Dhaka National Medical College being the most vulnerable. Urgent assessments of high-risk buildings in Dhaka city should be conducted within the next 3-5 years, as most buildings in Dhaka are at risk of collapse if an earthquake above 4 or 5 on the Richter scale occurs. Only 23% of these buildings have been constructed by engineers.

To ensure the safety of the public, it is imperative for the government to assess whether the buildings at risk in Dhaka were constructed in accordance with the Bangladesh National Building Code. If a building is found to be non-compliant, it should be marked with an orange label to indicate that it is not environmentally friendly and with a red label if it poses a danger to the occupants. This will allow for better identification of potentially hazardous buildings and enable necessary actions to be taken to mitigate the risk of disasters.

The public must be educated on how to respond during emergencies such as fires and earthquakes, and every area should have a non-vulnerable refuge center stocked with food and equipment to provide safety during disasters.

Dr Mohammad Kamrul Islam, Kidney Transplant Surgeon & MD, CKDU Hospital

Although patients undergoing dialysis are deemed to have a greater susceptibility to contracting the COVID-19 virus, over 300 kidney transplants were successfully performed during the pandemic. In Bangladesh, only a handful of hospitals, including Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Kidney Foundation, Center for Kidney Disease & Urology Hospital, and Birdem Hospital, regularly conduct kidney transplants. The pandemic posed significant challenges for dialysis patients, who could not travel to hospitals for their treatment or import their medications from abroad. To overcome these obstacles, we implemented a home delivery system for medication and established a separate dialysis floor in the hospital. The success rate of the transplants remained high at over 96%, with less than 3% failure rate recorded last year.

Professor Dr Nizamuddin Chowdhury, President, Bangladesh Renal Association

The impact of kidney dysfunction extends beyond just the patient, affecting their family members socially, financially, and psychologically. However, early detection of the condition can significantly improve the prognosis of kidney disease. Unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed in the final stages of the disease, leaving no chance for recovery. Due to the lack of visible symptoms, kidney disease often goes undiagnosed until it's too late.

Acute kidney dysfunction, often caused by excessive painkillers and antibiotics, requires early dialysis for a higher chance of recovery. In preparation for natural calamities, it's essential to have functional resources available for kidney patients. Recognizing chronic kidney disease as a Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) at the government level would allow for special attention to be given to kidney patients and doctors, ultimately improving the management and treatment of this debilitating condition.

Professor Dr Anwar Hossain Khan, President, Pediatrics Nephrology Society of Bangladesh

Kidney-related complications often arise in childhood or even before birth. To investigate hypertension in school-going children, we conducted a survey of 3267 students and found that 4.38% of them were suffering from the condition. Alarmingly, 30% of the students were obese, putting them at a higher risk of developing hypertension, which can persist into adulthood.

Furthermore, with 25% of babies now born premature, their reduced number of nephrons (the basic units of the kidney) puts them at risk of developing Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) at an early stage of adulthood. If this trend continues, we can expect a ""tsunami"" of CKD patients in the future, making it crucial to prioritize preventing preterm births through maternal care and planned pregnancies. We must also monitor the food quality of children, as those who consume fast food and salty snacks are more likely to develop hypertension.

To mitigate these issues, it's essential to address them seriously, as it not only saves our children's health but also a significant amount of revenue for the government in the future.

Dr Harisul Haq, Professor, Department of Cardiology, BSMMU

It is surprising that Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has not yet been recognized as a Non-Communicable Disease (NCD). Our body is like an orchestra, where each organ is critically linked with the others. Cardiorenal syndrome, which can cause acute or chronic problems in the heart or kidneys, can result in a corresponding problem in the other organ. Acute chronic heart failure can lead to and worsen CKD.

In light of this, it is crucial to be prepared for natural calamities by keeping emergency kits and dry food supplies for three to four days.

Additionally, CKD and heart failure patients must limit their water intake to avoid complications.

Rezwan Salehin, Execute Director, KAMPS

The primary objective of KAMPS is to raise awareness about kidney diseases and promote knowledge about their symptoms. We aim to provide education and resources to help people stay safe from this dangerous disease. Additionally, we provide life-saving dialysis and testing services to patients in need.

In times of disaster, transportation and communication may be disrupted, and the supply chain for medicine and treatment may be unavailable. Kidney patients, who require ongoing care, are particularly vulnerable in these situations. Collecting a sufficient amount of medication in advance may be the only solution for these patients. However, to better prepare for disasters, we advocate for the creation of better infrastructure and the establishment of more disaster-proof treatment centers. This would help ensure that kidney patients receive the care they need during and after emergencies.

Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu, Former Captain, National Cricket Team of Bangladesh

Including disaster preparedness in the curriculum can equip students with the knowledge needed to respond effectively in times of crisis. By widely disseminating information about which foods are detrimental to kidney and heart health, students are more likely to retain this knowledge for life.

With only 300 nephrologists in our country, it is essential to address this scarcity appropriately. We also need to establish a comprehensive database that includes the names of doctors and technicians, which can be activated quickly during emergencies. Rather than solely focusing on constructing large buildings and infrastructure, we must prioritize the inclusion of necessary safety measures to ensure preparedness for any disaster. Our outlook needs to shift to emphasize safety and risk mitigation.

Md Mijanur Rahman, Director General, Department of Disaster Management

The recent earthquake in Turkey serves as a stark reminder of the importance of disaster preparedness. It is imperative that we learn from this event and take necessary steps to safeguard the lives of our citizens. To this end, we must prioritize disaster prevention and response strategies, and make concerted efforts to raise public awareness of disaster preparedness.

In our efforts to protect the most vulnerable members of our society, particularly those with pre-existing medical conditions such as kidney disease, we must take special care. By investing in comprehensive disaster management plans and ensuring that everyone is well-informed and equipped to deal with emergencies, we can effectively minimize the impact of disasters and save countless lives.

The government has a plan to construct a national emergency operation centre. Fortunately, the Chinese government has agreed to provide funding for this crucial project. We have successfully acquired the required land for the centre from the Food Department. Moreover, we are actively searching for suitable land to establish a humanitarian staging area, which will significantly enhance our emergency preparedness capacity.

The Fire Brigade and Meteorology are two vital government bodies that play a crucial role in combating disasters. While the former falls under the purview of the Home Ministry, the latter is overseen by the Defense Ministry. If these agencies were brought under one umbrella, our disaster preparedness could have been further improved.

Considering the vulnerability of volunteers residing in Dhaka city during a disaster, it is imperative to train individuals from neighboring areas. This approach would ensure that volunteers can come forward to aid during crises, instead of being affected by the calamity themselves.

548,Skilling Bangladesh: challenges and possibilities,"Swisscontact Bangladesh in collaboration with The Daily Star organized a roundtable titled ‘The current trends in skills development sector of Bangladesh: challenges and possibilities’ on February 15, 2023. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Dr Sayema Haque Bidisha, Research Director, SANEM and Professor, Department of Economics, University of Dhaka & Keynote presenter

Upskilling is crucial in Bangladesh due to several reasons. The country is experiencing a demographic transition window, which requires an efficient workforce. Additionally, as the country looks forward to LDC graduation, it must address the constraints and challenges associated with the transition. One such challenge is related to the skills and skilling of the workforce, compounded by the introduction of artificial intelligence and automation, which is replacing many low-skilled and medium-skilled labor forces.

TVET institutes can play a vital role in addressing these challenges by translating and shaping the workers. However, a very small percentage of the population in Bangladesh is currently receiving training, with a significant portion focused on computing and office management. The private sector mainly provides the training, while the government and NGOs also play a role.

Our research methodology included a descriptive review, primary and qualitative surveys involving the Uttoron Training program beneficiaries in Dhaka, Habiganj, Moulvibazar, and Sylhet. In the primary survey, around 300 beneficiaries participated, with 75% being male. However, not many were aware of soft skills such as time management. The respondents mentioned the need for more practical classes, classroom workshops, and materials.

After training, the employment status of those who were previously unemployed improved significantly. However, skill mismatch was a challenge, compounded by the information gap and the institutional issue of employment requiring bribes. The study also identified family aspects, discrimination, and lack of breaks as reasons why females did not get jobs.

Our study provided sector-specific recommendations and challenges. Low wages were a significant challenge in the light engineering and jute sectors, while retaining workers was a challenge for advanced level areas such as ICT and RMG. Trainers and private sectors reported a lack of technical and soft skills, creativity, and interest in some industries.

The study recommends modernizing the TVET curriculum and training and upgrading the trainers to address the skills gap. Collaboration between TVET, the private sector, and educational institutes is also crucial. The government has initiatives to understand the skill demand and supply type, but bridging the gap between the demand and supply sides remains a challenge.

Dr Atonu Rabbani, Professor, Mushtaque Chowdhury Chair, James P Grant School of Public Health, BRAC University

Industrial development has been seen as an important part of overall development for the past 20 years. However, our industrial development and future experiences will largely depend on how we acquire skills. Unfortunately, we are not doing a good job in skills acquisition on average, and our total worker productivity has remained flat or even decreased in recent years. This is a problem because Bangladesh is a young economy that will eventually run out of young people, so we need to recalibrate our position and develop training programs.

The key challenge in developing training programs is the coordination problem. Trainees want to benefit from training, trainers want to gain something from it, and employers need to reap some benefit from increased productivity. However, employers are often reluctant to provide active training because they are unsure if they will benefit from it. There is a crack between what employers want and what institutions are providing. One solution to this problem is to develop deliberate training programs that focus on the kind of skills that will be most helpful to reduce graduate unemployment in Bangladesh, which is one of the highest in the world.

The issue of incentives is also important. Employers are often hesitant to provide training because they fear that employees will leave and take their newly acquired skills elsewhere. It is also expensive for trainees to pay for their own training, and they may not value the training after it is completed. Accreditation is also important to ensure that the training is of high quality.

Soft skills are just as important as technical skills, and the focus should be on general skill development rather than specific or current skills. However, our skill providers often overlook this fact.

Finally, without addressing the shortcomings of the general education system, it is unlikely that a viable solution will be found.

Dr Md. Abdul Karim, Executive Director, UCEP, Former Principal Secretary, GoB

The benefits of skill development in a country are crucial for poverty reduction, economic development, and empowering women. Unfortunately, the current situation of skill development in Bangladesh leaves much to be desired. The majority of individuals in Bangladesh aspire to obtain a Master's degree in a general subject, which is not necessarily beneficial for securing employment.

By contrast, countries like Germany, Japan, and Australia place a higher emphasis on technical education, with percentages ranging from 60 to 73 percent. In Bangladesh, only 14 percent of students graduate with technical qualifications, while 86 percent have general qualifications.

To address this issue, the government aims to increase the number of technical education qualified individuals to 60 percent by 2040, and 50 percent by 2025. Such targets are crucial for achieving middle-income status, reducing poverty, and empowering the nation with skilled manpower.

While the government has invested in infrastructure, buildings, and facilities for technical education, the shortage of good teachers and trainers remains a critical issue. Institutions like UCEP, which have been providing technical education to underprivileged, women, and indigenous people since 1972, play a vital role in addressing this shortage.

To increase the number of skilled individuals, Bangladesh needs to shift its focus from general education to technical and vocational education.

Barrister Sameer Sattar, President, Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI)

Skill development is crucial for economic growth, and the Dhaka Chamber recognizes this as a pressing issue. However, Bangladesh faces many challenges in this area. For instance, 84% of youth lack basic digital skills, partly because 54% of rural households lack internet access. Additionally, 30% of technical and higher professionals have a skills gap. Bangladesh ranks low in vocational training among South Asian countries, and its TVET education ranks 87th out of 132 countries.

Another challenge is the shortage of employable skills among job seekers, despite two million graduates entering the job market annually. To address this issue, we need a youth employment strategy that is aligned with economic needs. This should include a focus on updating and aligning the TVET curriculum with industry demands. To achieve this, we need to invest in building research institutes, faculty development, capacity building, and training trainers.

Collaboration between industries and academia is also crucial. We must work together to redesign the curriculum based on market demand. By addressing these challenges and implementing a comprehensive strategy, we can improve the reach and effectiveness of TVET education in Bangladesh. This will not only benefit job seekers but also help the country realize its economic potential.

Ligaya Dumaoang, TVET and Skills Development Specialist, ILO

The ILO is also collaborating with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to develop a South Asia qualifications framework that will facilitate the mobility of workers within the region.

To address the quality of TVET teachers, there is a need for continuous capacity-building initiatives. The ILO is supporting e-learning courses for teacher training and other skills training, such as in the care economy and graphic design. However, demotivation among TVET teachers remains a significant challenge that must be addressed to improve the overall quality of TVET in Bangladesh. Technical support can be provided to upgrade the capacities of TVET teachers.

Finally, to motivate young people to undertake TVET programs, a strategic communication plan is necessary to rebrand TVET and highlight its benefits. With the right messaging and outreach, TVET can become an attractive option for youth seeking viable career paths that align with the demands of the job market.

Farooq Ahmed, Secretary General and CEO, Bangladesh Employer's Federation

We need a comprehensive transformation of the skill development ecosystem to bring about significant change. Although the private sector accounts for 75% of the skill development curriculum in Bangladesh, skill development remains a public sector-driven initiative. In the Skill Development Policy 2023, the NSDA, the government, Industry Skill Councils (ISCs), and NGOs are identified as the key implementing agencies. However, the policy fails to adequately involve the private sector, which is a significant gap. To bridge this gap, I suggest that the private sector should be the given the responsibility of providing skill development training, with the government playing the role of regulator and ensuring accountability.

Skill development should be divided into two categories: general skills and employment-targeted skills development. In the latter process, people would first receive an employment letter and then go through training before joining their jobs. India has successfully implemented similar projects on a large scale, reaping significant benefits.

While we often focus on training blue-collar workers, factories can easily invest in their training. However, what we lack is proper training facilities for supervisors and mid-level managers. We must address this issue urgently.

When we revise the TVET curriculum, it's important to also consider updating the teaching module to ensure it meets the needs of students and prepares them to apply their knowledge effectively in their chosen job fields. This means taking a student-centered approach that emphasizes practical, hands-on learning and incorporates modern teaching techniques and technologies. By doing so, we can help ensure that TVET students are well-equipped to succeed in the workplace and contribute to the country's economic growth.

One of the most pressing challenges faced by Bangladesh's labour market is the low participation rate of women, which has a significant impact on the country's productivity. Bangladesh is also failing to fully utilize its demographic dividend due to this gap. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the barriers preventing women from entering the labour market and take effective steps to remove them.

Md. Humayun Kobir Project Director, Learning and Earning Development Project, ICT Division, GoB

In 2014, we launched the ""Learning and Earning"" project with the aim of developing 53,000 human resources by providing professional outsourcing training in three courses - web design and development, digital marketing, and graphic design. The duration of the training was 50 days or 200 hours. The project has achieved tremendous success in creating earning opportunities for a large number of marginalized young people.

We need to focus more on the outsourcing market so that our young people can use their skills to earn foreign currency. The government has a plan to introduce more courses that align with the high-demand skills in the job market.

Currently, we are exploring opportunities to support female students by resuming training through six caravan buses in partnership with Swisscontact. This initiative will help us to empower more women to join the workforce.

Mashuda Begum, Senior Responsible Sourcing Manager, TESCO

The RMG sector in Bangladesh faces a significant challenge in terms of lack of women representation at the supervisor level, and it is crucial to identify and address the underlying issues. Soft skills are one of the key barriers that prevent women from reaching supervisory positions. Therefore, training institutes should incorporate soft skills training in their curriculum to enable women to acquire the necessary skills for promotion.

Conducting studies and research on the barriers that women workers face in the sector can provide valuable insights to inform policy and programs.

ANM Tanjil Ahsan, National Programme Officer, ILO

It is important to have a standardized national curriculum and certification system for all training programs. This will ensure that trainees receive a consistent level of education and skills, and that their qualifications are recognized both nationally and internationally.

Rupali Biswas, Chief Coordinator, Skills for Employment Investment Program (SEIP)

One way to enhance the skill development process for students is by providing them with industrial exposure during their university education. Jassore University of Science and Technology and Khulna University of Science and Technology are taking the initiative to create such opportunities in affiliation with BKMEA. This model should be adopted by other universities in Bangladesh to help students gain practical knowledge and experience about the industry they are studying for. By doing so, students will be better equipped to enhance their skills and apply their knowledge in a real-world setting, which will ultimately make them more employable and contribute to the growth of the country's economy.

Mujibul Hasan, Country Director, Swisscontact Bangladesh

Uttoron has been a significant project for Swisscontact, which has been implemented in two phases and achieved several notable results. Through this project, we collaborated with private sectors and agencies and achieved measurable outcomes, such as training a significant number of people and creating new businesses in Bangladesh. These achievements have positively impacted the lives of the beneficiaries, and we believe that Uttoron will leave a lasting legacy in the country.

Despite the challenges posed by the prolonged pandemic during the current phase of Uttoron, we always found ways to deliver on our commitments. We have learned valuable lessons from this experience that we can replicate and build upon in our future skills development programs in Bangladesh. This has shown us that with agility and innovation, we can work effectively to address daily challenges that come our way.

Muhammad Imrul Kabir, Director, Corporate Affairs, Chevron Bangladesh

At Chevron, our values guide our strategy as we work to provide safe, reliable, and affordable ever-cleaner energy in Bangladesh. Our commitment to lower carbon and higher returns drives us to innovate and find new ways to protect the environment while meeting the energy needs of the country. As part of our social responsibility, we focus on three areas: health, education, and economic development, where we aim to make a positive impact in the communities where we operate.

One of our most significant achievements in economic development has been the Uttoron project, which complements Bangladesh's target of becoming a developed country by 2041. Uttoron is a five-year project that has two signature initiatives: technical school development partnering with Sylhet City Corporation and partnering with Khulna Shipyard to build an advanced welding workshop.

We are proud to contribute to Bangladesh's development goals and are committed to continuing our efforts to make a positive impact in the country's economic, social, and environmental sustainability.

Dr Sajjad Zohir, Executive Director, Economic Research Group (ERG) and moderator of the session

Skill development in Bangladesh needs a clear definition and a well-defined framework to identify the key players and regulators and their roles. Currently, it appears that the flow of funds, whether through loans or grants, largely dictates skill development initiatives. Policymakers should assess whether this approach is effective or not.

To improve the situation, parallel skill development initiatives by the private sector should be encouraged. While government support is important, it's also important not to wait for it indefinitely.

Standardization is necessary but too much of it can be detrimental. A locally rooted approach to defining standards should be prioritized.

549,Rohingya Crisis Response in Bangladesh: Is a strategic shift from the current approach needed?,"Approximately one million people from the Rohingya community escaping violence in Myanmar arrived in Cox's Bazar district of Bangladesh in August 2017. Five years have passed and the crisis has now evolved from an emergency to a protracted mode. The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) and international humanitarian agencies are working together towards a ""strategic shift"". Having passed the initial emergency response phase (2017-2019) and pandemic response phase (2020 – 2021), this response plan has now entered into the protracted phase, which is characterised by uncertainty due to delays in repatriation and fund crunch. BRAC and the Department of Development Studies, University of Dhaka organised a policy dialogue on 30 November 2022, bringing together government officials, diplomats, researchers, and development professionals to discuss accountable ways of delivering services to the Rohingyas while making the best use of the shrinking funds. A summary of the discussion is presented in this special supplement.

Inaugural Session

SM Monjur Rashid, head of programme, Advocacy for Social Change, BRAC

The goal of today's policy dialogue is to influence policymakers, implementers, and development partners to create a framework for managing the Rohingya crisis in a cost-effective way, taking into account the changing needs and priorities of the Rohingyas and the availability of necessary resources.

This dialogue has brought together a variety of actors and agencies who share our goals and interventions that will contribute to a comprehensive Rohingya response mechanism to meet the basic needs and priorities of the forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals. In the last five years, we have achieved impressive results together in responding to this humanitarian crisis in one of the world's largest refugee settlements.

Prof Dr Rashed Al Mahmud Titumir, chairman, Department of Development Studies, University of Dhaka

The persecuted Rohingyas in Bangladesh camps are in protracted crisis, following much exodus since genocide in Myanmar. In the camps, there are four main actors: the government, the Rohingya community, the host community, and international humanitarian agencies. Rohingyas live a sub-human life since the four actors operate within constraints of 'bounded response' as the durable solution of safe, dignified voluntary repatriation remains a far cry, with no walking the talk by the international community.

Our research suggests that the response strategy to the crisis is particularly concerning, as there is a significant mismatch between the basic requirements and the services provided in camps in view of changes in the population pyramid. In view of the high birth rate and shifts in age-structure in the camped population, the response strategy has to be re-designed to reflect the evidence and to address the needs, amongst others, in provisioning of basic services, education and training in skills for employability. The role of responding agencies - local, national, and international NGOs – requires changes in efficiency and capacities to address the changing nature of services while being mindful of reduction in overlapping. The changing nature of milieu and the contingent shift requires a re-think in host-Rohingya relationships.

During this phase, there has been a reduction in the flow of support, which is causing significant problems in addressing the needs associated with demographic patterns, with contingent consequences for education, health, basic services, skills, and employability. The downside is hopelessness.

During the Emergency Response Phase of 2017-2019, about 75% of the assistance requirement was met, declined to 65% during Pandemic Response Phase of 2020-2021. Currently – in the Protracted Phase, beginning in 2022, the level of assistance is only 44%, which is below the 50% mark. The international community needs to decide on an urgent basis how it will respond to this crisis in light of the Sustainable Development Goal; Leave No One Behind; since the crisis is in the emergency room while the government of Bangladesh with its limited capacities continue to bear the brunt.

According to our provisional estimates, the fund requirements for the Rohingya crisis response are USD 1315.2 million in 2023, USD 1578.24 million in 2024, USD 1893.88 million in 2025, USD 2272.66 million in 2026, and USD 2727.19 million in 2027. If the durable solutions are put on limbo, the funds requirement almost doubles in 2027 due to population growth. It is alarming that there has been a trend of gradual decline in the amount of funds received compared to the actual fund requirement. There has been no calculation of loss and damage in terms of the environment, which would require a significant amount of additional funding.

Vivek Prakash, head of cooperation, Rohingya Refugee Response, High Commission of Canada to Bangladesh

Canada's second strategy for the Myanmar and Rohingya crisis recognises this protracted situation. The first element of Canada's strategy is to continue advocating for and bringing attention to the Rohingya crisis, including to pressure the government of Myanmar to create conditions for the safe and dignified return of the Rohingya.

Secondly, Canada continues to provide essential services, such as healthcare and food as well as LPG, which has helped to address environmental degradation caused by deforestation. The camps today are much more lush than in 2019, because people use a lot less firewood. LPG and reforestation is a success story in this ecologically sensitive area.

The third pillar of Canada's strategy is to improve the resilience and self-reliance of the Rohingya people. This includes supporting education, skills development, and livelihoods. These long-term supports are vital for a more sustainable solution.

The final pillar of the strategy aims to promote social cohesion by supporting the host community to ensure they are not left behind. We must address their aspirations to improve skills and work in areas with greater opportunity, such as electronic repairs (for men), and graphic design (particularly for women).

It's important not to forget that this is a humanitarian crisis; the Rohingya were denied rights by their state and forcibly displaced to Bangladesh. In Bangladesh the Rohingya have no legal right to work, and that means that they need greater financial support. The sustained presence, engagement and involvement of national and local NGOs is vital and we must create livelihood opportunities, including with the private sector. The private sector will only join when they are assured of compliance with international labour regulations. The donor community can help meet the needs of the population, but we must all enable their own agency to live a dignified life.

Soo Jin Rhee, UNHCR Deputy Country Representative in Bangladesh

For the one million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, conditions in Cox's Bazar – one of the country's poorest districts and home to the world's largest refugee camp – remain overcrowded with most of the refugees remaining fully reliant on humanitarian assistance for their survival. Most refugees continue to be entirely dependent on food distributions, primary and specialist health care, support for access to water, sanitation and hygiene, cooking fuel through LPG distribution, and a multitude of critical protection interventions. These critical life-sustaining activities require continuous assistance and support from the Government and the humanitarian community.

While the ultimate solution to the crisis lies in creating conditions conducive for the voluntary, safe and dignified return to Myanmar, Rohingya refugees are likely to be staying in Bangladesh for the foreseeable future. In order to help Rohingya refugees live a dignified life in the refugee camps and become more productive members of society, bolstering resilience and self-reliance through investment of education, skill development and livelihoods is all the more important. This will require providing them with the necessary resources and support to develop skills and access to livelihood opportunities in a sustainable manner.

Following the signing of the MoU in October 2021, UN operations have been engaged and scaled up its humanitarian assistance and services for the 30,000 refugees which to date have been relocated. To ensure the success of the Bhasan Char project, it is key to provide refugees with viable livelihood opportunities and facilitate market linkages. Without such longer-term interventions, it will be difficult to sustain the humanitarian operation on the island.

Asif Saleh, executive director, BRAC

There is no denying that our utmost priority is to advocate for the safe return of Rohingya refugees to their homeland. However, there is growing recognition that the current efforts to support the Rohingya community should shift from a short-term, crisis-focused approach to a more developmental approach that takes a mid-term view of the situation. This shift is essential not only from a humanitarian standpoint but also from a security perspective.

When young people are confined to a densely populated area with nothing to do, there is a genuine risk of instability and conflict. It is essential to consider the role of security and stabilisation as we look towards a longer-term approach.

It is essential to change the current response to the Rohingya crisis to sustain it in the present and future as long as this community remains in Bangladesh. Therefore, it is essential to reflect on the response's scope, governance, resourcing, and participation aspects and consider how they can be improved.

Robust education skills development opportunities are required for a sustainable approach. As resources and aid are decreasing, a more efficient and integrated mechanism of delivery services should be explored.

Kathryn Davis Stevens, mission director, USAID Bangladesh

Providing education and equipping Rohingya with skills and livelihood opportunities is essential not only for the refugees themselves, but also for the host communities. This will contribute to security, stability, and economic opportunity in those regions. It is also important to move beyond a focus on humanitarian assistance and adopt a multi-year approach that addresses the long-term needs of the Rohingya refugees. It is important to recognize that significant progress has been made in the Rohingya response effort, including the recent enactment of a skills development framework and volunteer engagement guidelines. Since 2017, the United States has contributed $1.9 billion to the response, with $1.5 billion going towards supporting the Rohingya in the camps and the host communities.

H.E. Mustafa Osman Turan, ambassador of Turkey to Bangladesh

As a country hosting the largest refugee population, Turkey is well-positioned to understand the situation in Bangladesh. We understand that the Government of Bangladesh is committed to starting repatriation as soon as possible, and we are supporting Bangladesh in international platforms and at the International Court of Justice to put pressure on Myanmar to accept the Rohingyas.

The increasing density of the Rohingya population is raising concerns about security, the provision of services, and the relationship between the host community and the Rohingya. If a longer-term policy is not adopted, this could be a recipe for disaster. The lack of employment and hope among the Rohingya can create a breeding ground for radicalization and other illegal activities. Law enforcement agencies often leave the camps at night, which leaves the Rohingya vulnerable, particularly women and children. It is essential to address the issue of nighttime security to ensure the protection of all members of the community.

Given the decline in funding, it may be necessary for Bangladesh to tie the funding for humanitarian assistance in Cox's Bazar to a multi-annual framework to ensure that it is not redirected to other priorities. This will help to provide a more stable and long-term approach to addressing the needs of the Rohingya and supporting their self-reliance.

MA Mannan, minister, Ministry of Planning, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh

Initially, the prioritised needs of the Rohingya, such as shelter, food, medical care, education, and skill development, were addressed in a scattered manner. However, with the help of NGOs and UN bodies, humanitarian assistance has gradually been structured into a more organised framework. However, this is not enough; we need more financial support and a deeper understanding of the Rohingya crisis.

The lack of security, particularly at night, in the camps is a major concern. The Ministry of Home Affairs, the RRRC, and other relevant authorities must work together to address this issue and find possible solutions. The lack of security is not only alarming for the Rohingya population but also for NGO professionals, both local and international, who are unable to properly perform their roles without proper security measures in place.

The Government of Bangladesh believes in engaging with the Myanmar regime in an effort to find a solution to the Rohingya crisis. While past attempts at dialogue have not been successful, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to pursue this approach in the future. It is hoped that by working with the international community, a stable regime in Myanmar can be engaged in dialogue and discussion to find a way for the Rohingyas to return to their homeland.

Prof Dr Maksud Kamal, pro-vice chancellor (Academic), University of Dhaka

The funding deficit for Rohingya humanitarian assistance is increasing every year, and it will be difficult for Bangladesh to provide the necessary assistance without continuous financial support from the international community. As the host country, Bangladesh should adopt an interim strategy with a short-term approach, given the current situation. It is not realistic to pursue a long-term strategy to support the needs of the Rohingyas, including education and livelihood support, until the crisis is resolved. It is essential that the international community continue to provide the necessary financial support to help Bangladesh address the needs of the Rohingyas in a sustainable manner.

The Rohingya crisis has had significant environmental impacts in the camp area, including a decline in groundwater levels, landslides, and soil erosion. For example, landslides have occurred almost every year, with one in 2022 resulting in the deaths of eight individuals, the displacement of 13,000 people, and more than 500 injuries. Soil erosion has also increased as a side effect of efforts to protect against landslides, rising from 59 pounds per hectare in 2015 to 80 pounds per hectare in 2020. It is essential to comprehensively address these environmental issues in order to protect the health and well-being of the Rohingya and the surrounding community.

Technical session 1: Basic Services, Food Security and Skills of the FDMNs

Prof Salma Akhter, Department of Sociology, University of Dhaka

One issue facing the Rohingya population in Bangladesh is determining the ethnic identity of those born in the country. This can be difficult for this young generation to understand their role and status in Bangladesh, especially if they have dual identities.

Another issue is the social cohesion between the host community and the Rohingya population. Both communities often feel vulnerable, insecure, and deprived, and may view each other as competitors.

Women from both communities also face gender-based violence, with some Rohingya women informed that their husbands pressurise them and want to have more children when women do not want to. Host community women mentioned their husbands abandoning them by marrying Rohingya women as Rohingya women get support from the development partners and host community women do not have income generating activities. It is important to address these issues in order to promote understanding and harmony between the host community and the Rohingya population.

One of the challenges in addressing the education and employment needs of the Rohingya population in Bangladesh is determining the appropriate education system for them. It may also be difficult to prepare them for the job market and integrate them into Bangladesh's educational system. A sustainable approach may be taken to provide livelihood and skill development training to both the host community and the Rohingya community in order to make them employable.

While some development partners may be willing to allow refugees to move to their countries, it may be more prestigious for the Rohingya to become self-sufficient through employment rather than continuing to move from one country to another as refugees.

Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief

The scarcity of qualified teachers from the community is a significant issue,.even we don't find a suitable number of competent teachers for the Burmese language. For the last few years NGOs have been recruiting one teacher from the host community to teach English and Science, and another from the Rohingya community to teach the Burmese language in every learning centre. However, the stipend offered to teachers from the host community is not bare minimum to engage them to work in the camps. As a result, the quality of teaching has been compromised-leading to a higher drop-out rate in the camps. While the Myanmar curriculum has been introduced, there has been a challenge of having a proper assessment system or certifications of education. Additionally, there is a need for more space and classrooms for learning centers, but because of the land scarcity and given the context of nature of the land we cannot go for further construction of the infrastructures.

In regards to law and order, all the Camp in Charges (CiCs) cannot stay in the camp premises at night, as there are no such arrangements yet. However, there are some police camps in the area. Plans are underway to expand the number of police camps.

The demographic status of the Rohingya is somehow ignored when we talk about gender based violence or polygamy as the ratio of female is higher than the male and among the males, there are fewer eligible men because many of them were killed and imprisoned in Myanmar and many live abroad - in Malaysia or Saudi Arabia. Some unscrupulous individuals are taking advantage of this situation by taking multiple wives, which contributes to the increase in violence in the camp.

Prof Taiabur Rahman, dean, School of Social Science and Humanities, IUB

The Rohingya crisis is a global issue. We cannot look at it from only the points of view of the host or camp dwellers. We have to look at it from a comprehensive holistic perspective. We can call it a meta governance issue as there are so many actors involved – international, national, regional, host, local, non-government organisations, and private organisations. One major issue is the engagement of Myanmar. We can take care of systems that will create basic service provisions in the camp but the government needs to work with relevant stakeholders to send these people back to their home country.

Technical session 2: Changing Resource Needs and Roles of Relevant Actors in Responding Rohingya Crisis

Dr Bokhtiar Ahmed, professor, Department of Anthropology, University of Rajshahi

I personally witnessed the influx of Rohingya in the 1990s as a young member of the host community. At that time, there were few NGO professionals and hardly any local people working in crisis management operations. However, now there is an unprecedented number of people from the host community working for many NGOs.

Fortunately, Bangladesh had the necessary development sector expertise, with professionals experienced in emergency response and humanitarian efforts, to effectively handle the large influx of Rohingya in September 2017. As a result, Bangladesh was able to respond well to the situation despite facing other limitations.

Dr Helal Mohiuddin, professor, Department of Political Science and Sociology, North South University

In this discussion, the RRRC mentioned that the upcoming strategic plan for the Rohingya response is being designed based on the demographic shift of the Rohingya population. However, I believe it would be wise to base the strategic plan on the long-term management of the emerging protection situation, considering government policies, diplomatic relations, and other factors. The plan should address issues such as localization, overlapping, repetition, inconsistency, and duplicity in policy direction.

Our research has revealed that adolescent Rohingya boys in the camps are the most neglected group in terms of development interventions. This lack of support increases their risk of involvement in radical activities, which is harmful not only to the Rohingya community but also to the host community.

Therefore, it is important to develop leadership within the Rohingya community so that their voices can be heard and their perspectives considered. Currently, their voices are largely missing from discussions and decision-making processes.

Dr ASM Amanullah, professor, Department of Sociology, University of Dhaka

There is a lack of coordination in the health services in the Rohingya camps, as demonstrated by various studies of these camps. It is important to disseminate important research findings to donors and development partner communities for a better understanding and future planning.

Bangladesh has not ratified the 1951 Convention or the 1967 Protocol, and there is a question of how to mobilize resources in the camps to generate employment and take local resource mobilization initiatives if the Rohingyas are not considered refugees and international donors use the term ""refugee."" Bangladesh should accede to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol.

It is also important to consider the increase in noncommunicable diseases in the Rohingya camps. Our dietary study in the camps found that there is nutrition and food security, but there is a lack of dietary diversity. Additionally, there is an unmet need for family planning services, mental health services, and trauma services, in addition to basic needs such as education.

Mia Mohammad Mainul Kabir, director general (Myanmar), Ministry of Foreign Affairs

NGOs and donor agencies, at times, acknowledge the lack of coordination among themselves in terms of their humanitarian operations in the camps. To address this, there needs to be effective coordination among all actors involved in the Rohingya response. This can be achieved by combining the government's direction and donor mechanisms to ensure transparency and proper coordination.

It is clear that all Rohingyas are interested in returning home, and the situation in Rakhine needs to improve. Therefore, donors and UN agencies should boost their engagement there to ensure that the Rohingyas can return safely and sustainably to their homeland.

Bangladesh and UN agencies have agreed on a couple of new initiatives, including skill development programs, volunteer engagement for the Rohingyas. The skill development framework will enhance the skills of the Rohingyas in sectors that they were engaged in Rakhine before their forced displacement, such as agricultural work. In addition, Rohingya children are learning inside the camps following the Myanmar curriculum.

Dr Imtiaz Ahmed, professor of International Relations, University of Dhaka

It is important to include the Rohingyas in discussions about strategies that affect them. The Center for Genocide Studies has collected extensive data on violence over the past decade and has also mapped violence in Rohingya camps. Contrary to what some may believe, these camps are actually safer than cities like New York or Chicago. In fact, the rate of gun violence in the United States is around 40,000 per year, while violence in Rohingya camps is significantly lower. This is due in part to the strong social resilience of the Rohingyas in these camps.

This year, there is a 300 million US Dollar deficit. As long as refugees and stateless people are here, UN agencies have responsibilities. The United States alone funded arms for the Ukraine war worth 20 billion dollars in one year, yet we are worrying about a deficit of 300 million. The annual transaction of Yaba drugs is between 30 and 60 billion US dollars, and the Myanmar military has a business interest in the Yaba trade. However, the rest of the world remains silent on this issue.

We must be realistic and consider whether we can implement a Marshall plan, in which the Myanmar state sees it as advantageous to address the needs of the Rohingyas, who they view as Arakani Muslims.

CLOSING SESSION

SK Md Moniruzzaman, director general (Additional Secretary), NGO Affairs Bureau, Prime Minister's Office

We have established earning opportunities for the Rohingyas in Bhasan Char, such as farming. However, we need to create even more opportunities for them. The government plans to relocate more Rohingyas to Bhasan Char to ease the overcrowding in the Cox's Bazar area.

Despite limited resources, our representatives continually assess the needs of the Rohingyas and prioritize support accordingly to ensure that relief efforts are not wasted. It is important to carefully consider the potential impact and sustainability of any new projects for the Rohingyas.

Gwyn Lewis, UN Resident Coordinator in Bangladesh

The ultimate solution to the Rohingya crisis lies with the government of Myanmar. The political efforts of the UN to create a conducive environment for addressing the political issues at hand continues to be of utmost importance. The Security Council and General Assembly have increased their engagement in this issue since 2017, but action continues to be needed.

The repatriation of the Rohingyas to Myanmar must be voluntary, safe, and sustainable. The Rohingyas have faced persecution for decades, and when they do return home, they will need a safe place to live and necessary services must be in place. In the meantime, education and skill development is essential for the Rohingya community to have the knowledge and experience to be self-reliant when they return home.

The international community's support to the response has been critical in ensuring that Bangladesh does not bear the burden of supporting the Rohingyas alone. This support needs to continue, but to be effective and efficient in addressing this crisis, we also need to think long-term. Together we should consider how we can continue to provide essential services such as health and education. It will be important to engage with international financial institutions or different donors to secure long-term funding and multi-year programming.

Providing the Rohingya with livelihood opportunities is also another avenue to be explored that will also mean less reliance on assistance. Giving people choices and allowing them to able to support themselves will mean the response is more sustainable until the Rohingya are able to return safely and with dignity to their homes.

Shabbir Ahmad Chowdhury, secretary (West), Ministry of Foreign Affairs

Over the past five years, we have exhausted our diplomatic efforts to address this crisis. We have engaged bilaterally with many countries around the world, but the only viable solution is the safe and voluntary repatriation of the Rohingya to Myanmar. While the problem was created by Myanmar, we have unfortunately been paying the price for it. The solution must be found by the Myanmar government.

Alternative measures such as developing the skills of the Rohingya with the goal of increasing their employment in Bangladesh may lead to increased unemployment or underemployment of Bangladeshi citizens, causing tension and competition among the host community. These approaches should not be pursued as they do not align with the development aspirations and Sustainable Development Goals of Bangladesh and its population.

Bangladesh is heavily impacted by climate change, with a growing rate of internal displacement due to rising seawater levels and other natural disasters. The influx of 600,000 Rohingya in 2017 has changed the demographic pattern in the Cox's Bazar area, as the Rohingya population now outnumbers the host community. There are still 600,000 Rohingya living in the Rakhine state of Myanmar. It is important not to suggest any approaches that could serve as a pull factor for the remaining Rohingya to try to enter Bangladesh.

KAM Morshed, senior director, BRAC

I am not summarising but repeating some of the most common messages we heard all day. The crisis started in Myanmar, and the ultimate solution lies in the sustainable and dignified repatriation to Myanmar. Meanwhile, we must minimize Bangladesh's economic and security burden and remain committed to compensating the host community's ""loss and damage"".

First, we must improve the effectiveness, accountability and economy of the current response requiring more than $3,000/Rohingya Household. Adopting an integrated delivery model, perfected by BRAC and other local NGOs, and increased use of local experts can help.

Second, we must create conditions so FDMNs can earn part of their keep. Meaningful engagement of Rohingya youths in skills development and income-generating activities would reduce the need for external support and deter frustrated youth from going astray.

Studies presented today raised more questions than they answered—which was the intention. I hope these studies will form the foundation for future debates and policy responses.

Recommendations

The changing needs and priorities of the Rohingyas should be assessed through a participatory process to project the upcoming resource needs and make a realistic plan to address this crisis.

Increase the involvement of local actors in the Rohingya response effort. The funding agencies should allocate resources and take initiative to build capacity of local actors, including NGOs, to manage the crisis in a cost-effective manner.

Tie the funding for humanitarian assistance to a multi-annual framework.

Promote understanding and harmony between the host community and the Rohingya population.

Effective coordination among all actors involved in the Rohingya response is needed.

Bangladesh should accede to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol.

A comprehensive strategy is needed to facilitate the safe, dignified repatriation of the Rohingyas.

The evolving nature of the Rohingya crisis necessitates a strategic shift in the way that some innovative interventions on livelihoods, food security, education, and skill development should be taken.

Address environmental issues comprehensively in the response to the Rohingya crisis.

550,Policy actions to improve SRH services for adolescents and youth: Beyond gaps and challenges,"Network for Ensuring Adolescents Reproductive Health Rights and Services (NEARS) in association with The Daily Star organized a roundtable titled “Policy actions to improve SRH services for adolescents and youth: Beyond gaps and challenges” on December 19, 2022. The event was supported by Marie Stopes Bangladesh. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Dr. Farhana Ahmad, Director-External Relations and New Business Development, Marie Stopes Bangladesh

Young people have the right to receive reproductive health services that meet their needs in a respectful and nonjudgmental manner, regardless of their age. Criticisms or unwelcoming attitudes will prevent young people from accessing the care they need.

All adolescents should have access to appropriate SRHR services, including contraception, without requiring authorization by law, policy, or practice.

Young people may seek advice from family planning providers about physical changes, sex, relationships, family issues, and problems of growing up, in addition to contraception.

Bangladesh has the highest adolescent pregnancy rate outside of Sub-Saharan Africa. Reducing unintended pregnancies is essential for improving adolescent health and their social and economic well-being.

Access to proven, safe, and effective family planning methods can significantly reduce deaths and complications from unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions.

Current government guidelines and family planning manuals state that only married couples are eligible for government family planning services, aside from counselling. NEARS would like to advocate for policy changes to remove this requirement and ensure that all adolescents and women are eligible for the DGFP's family planning services, regardless of their marital status.

Dr. Jaynal Haque, Consultant NEARS and Ex-programme manager MCH, DGFP and Keynote presenter

Adolescence is a time of physical and psychological changes that occur after childhood and before adulthood. During this time, adolescents may face a variety of health challenges, including mental health issues, sexual and reproductive health issues, substance abuse, and physical activity changes. These challenges can be influenced by environmental, social, and economic factors, such as access to healthcare, exposure to violence, and family and cultural dynamics. Adolescents have the potential to establish health-promoting behaviors that will contribute to their current and future well-being. They also have a significant role to play in society, family, and their country.

Early pregnancy presents obstacles such as the end of formal education and increased poverty. In Bangladesh, 84% of unmarried male adolescents and 75% of unmarried female adolescents know about at least one of three common contraceptive methods (oral pill, condom, emergency contraceptive pill). There is also a higher percentage of unmet need for family planning among married adolescent girls (15.5%) compared to married women overall (12%).

Ensuring access to adolescent-friendly services and comprehensive information about family planning options can enable adolescents to make fully informed choices that meet their fertility preferences in ways that are appropriate for their life stage and circumstances. In Bangladesh, 5.33 million babies are born each year, with 2.63 million of these pregnancies being unintended and 1.58 million resulting in abortion. Pregnancy and childbirth complications are a leading cause of death for adolescents in the country. Providing adolescents with access to information and services related to sexual and reproductive health, including family planning, can help to prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce the risks associated with childbirth.

Individuals should have the freedom to decide on the number and spacing of their children, and to do so, they must have access to contraceptive methods that they can use voluntarily, free from discrimination, violence, or coercion.

Governments should implement a national family planning program to ensure that women and girls can access and use contraceptive methods of their choice without any restrictions based on age, ethnicity, marital status, or other factors.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that governments remove legal and policy barriers to adolescents' and young people's access to health services, and that these services be provided in a way that respects and maintains privacy and confidentiality and recognizes adolescents' evolving capacity.

WHO also recommends national and political commitment to sexual and reproductive health for adolescents and youth, as well as addressing the sexual and reproductive health and family planning needs of unmarried adolescents and young people and emphasizing comprehensive sexual education. It is important for young people to participate in policy development and for special provisions to be made to reach out to parents, teachers, and service providers.

Dr. Ubaidur Rob, Country Director, Population Council

Unfortunately, the rate of child marriage has remained unchanged for over 10 years, which means that adolescent pregnancy rates will not decrease as long as child marriage persists. Children born to malnourished young mothers will not have the same physical and mental capabilities as those born to mature mothers.

Additionally, one-third of pregnancies in Bangladesh are unplanned, totaling 1.6-1.8 million out of 5 million. Without the use of effective contraceptive methods, there will continue to be high rates of unplanned and unintended pregnancies. It is crucial to address the issue of child marriage in order to address these problems.

Prof. Sameena Chowdhury,

Former President, Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Bangladesh (OGSB)

In order to provide proper reproductive health care, it is necessary to provide contraceptives to both married and unmarried women and include this in policy.

Providing menstruation regulation through medication (MRM) services through telemedicine can be a helpful solution for people in need of these services.

Another issue is the complications that can arise during childbirth for young mothers, with many babies often needing to be delivered via caesarean section. It is important to address the issue of child marriage through policy in order to address these problems.

Miranda Beckman, Deputy Office Director, OPHNE, USAID

It is important to consider policy issues in a comprehensive context, as challenges such as child marriage and adolescent pregnancy can negatively impact the labor force participation of adolescent girls.

In order to effectively address the needs of adolescents, it is important to collect age and sex-disaggregated data through improved health information systems. This will allow us to understand how many married or unmarried adolescent females are seeking healthcare services.

It is also important to have comprehensive policies in place for vulnerable adolescents, including those who are homeless, living in slums, disabled, engaged in sex work, gender diverse, drug addicts, living in disaster-prone areas, or refugees.

Abdul Latif Mollah, Line Director, IEM, DGFP

Child marriage has been identified as the number one problem and there are some actions we can take at the policy level. There should be coordination among the ministry of health and family welfare, MOWCA, religion ministry, and youth ministry. Every ministry has a vital role in eradicating the child marriage issue which will solve a lot of our problems. The policies should encourage the media to make the general people aware of adolescent-related problems including child marriage.

At the policy level, we should have a board for pre-marital counseling from which couples will be required to collect a certificate acknowledging their understanding of marriage and family planning.

Arnob Chakrabarty, Managing Director, RedOrange Media and Communication

The modern health system in the world is trying to keep people away from doctors. When it comes to SRHR, it is about providing the right information so they do not have to go to the doctors. Unfortunately, we are talking more about the services rather than information and prevention. It is also true that we do not have any other choice as each year millions of girls are in this situation where they need these services.

There is a lot to do, but I think for now we should all come together and come up with an emergency plan for the next five years with a clear idea about the outcome to stop or reduce child marriage.

Jannatul Ferdous, MNCAH and Health Systems Specialist, UNICEF

This year, 73,000 of the 48 million adolescents in our country have received services including pregnancy counseling, family planning, and SRHR from the public sector. To reach more adolescents with information, we need to use a variety of platforms, including schools for comprehensive sexual education and digital platforms for those who have access.

However, there are also issues with health facility readiness and limited access. In order to address these challenges, we need to identify why our implementation strategies and action plans are not being effectively implemented. Policy briefs and recommendations may be diverse, but we need to clearly define the responsibilities of the health service, schools, community, and other areas.

We also need to consider the budget allocated for adolescent health services.

Dr Zahirul Islam, Senior Programme Officer, Development Cooperation Section, Embassy of Sweden

Globally, keeping girls in school for at least twelve years has been shown to be an effective intervention to reduce adolescent fertility. This can be achieved by incentivizing parents and creating an enabling environment that allows girls to attend school and college, which has many benefits.

In Bangladesh, there have been attempts to address early marriage through administrative processes. However, it is difficult to change social norms through these methods.

Many students, particularly girls, leave school due to early marriage, which creates a vicious cycle. Poverty is also a factor, as girls may not have other options besides marriage. To prevent early pregnancy, we must address the barriers that prevent girls from staying in school, including eve-teasing, sexual harassment, and elopements.

Mushfiqua Zaman Satiar, Senior Policy Advisor, Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands

It is important to involve men in all reproductive health-related initiatives. Both men and women should take responsibility for fertility and contraception, rather than just expecting women to use pills or long-term contraceptives.

The government should set a fixed time frame for agencies to disseminate information about reproductive health. While many projects have focused on girls, these can be a burden for them if they do not have the power to advocate for themselves. Simply speaking about zero child marriage is not enough if the consent of girls is not taken into consideration.

Sohanur Rahman, Coordinator, YouthNet for Climate Justice

Our experiences show that men often take on household duties but do not take on reproductive responsibilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed in Barishal that men were significantly less likely to seek reproductive health services than women, as if all the obligations were only for women. Girls do not often receive a friendly atmosphere because of societal attitudes, and men need to be included in addressing these issues.

SRHR services need to be provided in hard-to-reach areas.

Mahbub Ul Alam, Country Director, Pathfinder International

Victims of child marriage should be included in the service delivery network and protected on an emergency basis to prevent early pregnancy. Global evidence suggests that adolescent corner-based interventions are not effective, and we need to link facilities with the communities where adolescents live.

Additionally, the services provided should be rights-based and respectful of clients' demands, rather than imposing certain options.

S M Shaikat, Executive Director, SERAC Bangladesh

We don't have any data on unmarried adolescent girls, so we can only talk about the experiences of married adolescent girls. This means that an entire section of adolescent girls remains in an unknown zone, and our plans often ignore this invisible community.

We need to broaden our perspective to include adolescent girls with disabilities, those who are vulnerable to climate change, those who live in slums, and those who have dropped out of school.

Shale Ahmed, Executive Director, Bandhu Social Welfare Society

The needs of the transgender communities are often overlooked in discussions about sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). It is essential to include transgender individuals in any initiatives addressing SRHR. Service providers must also be trained on how to respectfully and inclusively serve these communities.

Dr Niaz Mohammad Kamali, Deputy Director & PM, CCSDP, DGFP

According to my experience in various jobs, I have observed that areas with lower income tend to have higher rates of child marriage. To reduce the prevalence of early marriage, it is important to provide girls with social and economic support. Without these resources, it will be difficult to address the issue effectively.

To improve the reliability of the birth registration system, it is necessary to ensure that it cannot be easily tampered with. One way to do this is by making local community leaders aware of the importance of transparency in this system.

Nondini Lopa, Liaison Officer, World Bank

Our current social norms and values often hinder access to SRHR information and services. The rise of fundamentalism around the world is also contributing to this trend, reversing progress made in women's empowerment. Therefore, we must work with Madrasa students.

We have not yet sufficiently addressed the issue of out-of-school interventions for SRHR. It is important to take steps to meet the SRHR needs of out-of-school adolescents, as they do not have the same access to information and resources as their in-school peers.

To address the future needs of SRHR, it is important to conduct a thorough human resource mapping of the SRHR sector and focus on building the capacity of existing resources from a human rights and gender-responsive perspective.

Dr Abdun Noor Tushar, Media Personality

We must determine the age range for adolescents, the age of consent, and the minimum age for marriage.

There are also issues with data collection in the health sector in Bangladesh, as private health facilities are a major provider of health care services but their data is not collected.

It is important to have a cohesive and targeted approach to health communication in order to deliver accurate information to all audiences

Dr. Ikhtiar Uddin Khandaker, President, NEARS

I would like to express my appreciation for your participation in the roundtable and the valuable recommendations provided.

We will use your suggestions to create a brief report and disseminate it to all relevant stakeholders in both the government and non-government sectors.

To effectively address the issues at hand, we should divide the recommendations into short-term, mid-term, and long-term categories and plan our interventions accordingly.

Tanjim Ferdous, In Charge of NGOs and Foreign Missions at the Business Development Team, The Daily Star

Today we have discussed a crucial national issue. The Daily Star has been actively reporting this issue for a long time. Our commitment is to ensure that every adolescent in the country has access to SRHR services. As a media outlet, we will do our best to raise awareness of the importance of SRHR.

Recommendations",2023-01-30 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/roundtables/news/policy-actions-improve-srh-services-adolescents-and-youth-beyond-gaps-and-challenges-3235036,2023-05-18 10:30:07,thedailystar
551,How girls are realizing their potentials: Opportunities and challenges,"UNFPA Bangladesh and CARE Bangladesh in association with The Daily Star organized a roundtable titled “How girls are realizing their potentials: Opportunities and challenges” on January 5, 2023. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Golam Mortoza, Editor (Bangla), The Daily Star

The saying goes, ""if creating opportunities isn't possible, remove the roadblocks so they can create their own."" Unfortunately, there is a prevalent mindset to restrict, particularly girls, from exploring their potential. We must recognize girls' potential and work to remove the barriers that prevent them from realizing it.

While we have yet to fully address this issue, it's important to conduct discussions like this, notify policymakers, and engage in grassroots work simultaneously. The progress that has been made thus far is a result of this grassroots work.

Sakina Sultana, Team Leader, CARE Bangladesh

Adolescent girls often face child marriage, interruptions in education and employment, and difficulties in accessing their rights, including sexual and reproductive health services, due to stereotypical mindsets and negative social norms. We aim to transform this negativity into positivity, empowering adolescent girls to reach their full potential and succeed in life.

CARE Bangladesh is currently implementing a project funded by UNFPA Bangladesh called ""Accelerating Action to End Child Marriage"" which is working in six districts to empower adolescent girls with a set of life skills, including knowledge and skills related to sexual and reproductive health, communication, negotiation, and decision-making. This enables them to self-reflect through education.

We must break the stereotype that women are only suitable for certain professions, such as teaching or handicrafts. Many women have proven themselves in traditionally male-dominated professions such as piloting and sports, helping to change societal attitudes towards women in these fields. As a result, new opportunities are opening up for women in various sectors. However, are our adolescent girls ready to seize these opportunities? To guide them towards this path, stakeholders must work to fill gaps and enhance their activities, so adolescent girls can unlock and utilize their potential and fulfill their dreams.

Mahmudur Rahman Khan, Technical Coordinator Research, M&E, CARE Bangladesh, (Keynote speaker)

The enrollment rate in secondary education decreased to 62% compared to 98% in primary education (UNESCO, 2018). The scenario worsens in tertiary education with 13% gross enrolment (BANBEIS, 2017). These systemic dropouts result in diverse consequences in realizing and achieving life aspirations, including education and employment. The direct consequence observed in labor force engagement is that female youth comprise 26% of the labor force compared to their male counterpart, which comprises 54.5% (BBS, 2018). Also impacts crucial stages of life, such as child marriage, unfortunately, results in early childbearing. Bangladesh is home to 38 million child brides, and 50% gave birth to their first child before the age of 18 (UNICEF, 2020).

Considering the situation, CARE Bangladesh conducted a study in 2022 that tried to see how the donors and government are investing and working to bring forward the potential of adolescent girls, stopping child marriage and availing gender equality.

Our study revealed that adolescent girls have a variety of aspirations and priorities, including gaining access to capacity building and skill development opportunities that specifically cater to their needs.

The study also identified a significant barrier of gendered norms that restrict community mobilization for adolescent girls. This makes it difficult for them to take collective action. Additionally, the legal and policy framework in place does not adequately support the rights and needs of both married and unmarried adolescent girls. Furthermore, the support for mental health and psychosocial well-being for adolescent girls is often overlooked and neglected.

We found that the government of Bangladesh has demonstrated its commitment to advancing the rights and well-being of adolescent girls by being a signatory to various international laws and declarations. As a result, several laws and policies have been enacted in the past two decades specifically aimed at addressing the needs of adolescent girls. The government is implementing various initiatives to improve the education and health outcomes of adolescent girls, and the private sector is providing opportunities for adolescent girls in nontraditional career fields. We also observed investments in families and other stakeholders who play a critical role in shaping expectations for adolescent girls.

We collected recommendations from adolescent girls, civil society organizations, and government stakeholders on how to address the gaps identified in our study. These recommendations include providing opportunities for adolescent girls to participate in meaningful dialogue and share their thoughts, ending the stigmatization of girls, taking steps to prevent child marriage, addressing societal controls on girls' sexuality, creating safe spaces for girls to discuss important issues, and empowering girls to connect with various forums and platforms at the grassroots level.

Sigma Ainul, Program Manager and Senior Program Officer, Population Council

Globally, only 15% of girls take STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines, and the numbers are lower in Bangladesh. This makes it difficult to provide women access to modern workplace skills-building subjects.

Three main things that would help girls-centered programs in Bangladesh. Firstly, we need to ensure that girls are given the right skills, including digital literacy and knowledge of information technology, as well as involvement in STEM subjects so that they can participate equally in the economy and society.

Secondly, we need to focus on soft skills, such as negotiation, self-esteem, problem-solving, and financial literacy, which are required in all occupations. We should also ensure that girls have access to accurate information regarding their reproductive life span and the choices and options available to them.

Thirdly, girls should be given a public space where they can gather and have access to relatable and inspirational mentors.

M A Akher, Director (Planning), Deputy Secretary, Department of Youth Development

We are partnering with the World Bank to work with NEET (Not in Employment, Education, or Training) individuals, who make up one-third of the population.

We have found that 80% of NEET individuals are those who have married before the age of 18. To reach this group the project includes a component to provide skill ladders for dropouts and married individuals in 250 Upazilas, allowing them to pursue vocational or formal education through open universities. In partnership with the ILO, we will also be implementing a Tk 165-crore project to train NEET individuals to become self-employed.

The UNFPA has helped us develop a youth index platform, and the government has also established a youth council.

Reefat Bin Sattar, Director of Program Development and Quality, Save the Children Bangladesh

There are several factors that enable girls to reach their potential. One approach is to focus on the girls as the center and consider the four circles that impact their lives: family, society, law, and policy. By examining opportunities and challenges within each circle, it becomes easier to identify recommendations for change.

In addition to economic empowerment, two other important forms of empowerment are political and social empowerment. Political empowerment involves creating opportunities for girls to participate and providing leadership, soft skills, livelihood skills, employability skills, and entrepreneurship skills. Social empowerment is also crucial, but it can also be a barrier to women's empowerment.

While there has been a decrease in the number of early marriages from 80% to 51%, in certain areas such as char areas, urban slums, and haor regions, the percentage may be higher. It is important to collect data at the division level to address these pockets of high risk. To make accurate and effective decisions, it's important to have accurate data that is included in the government information repository.

In addition to a Department for Women Affairs within the Ministry of Women and Children, a separate department for children is needed to ensure that female children are not excluded from attention.

Kamrun Nahar, Assistant Director (AQAU), Planning and Development Wing, Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE)

Adolescent girls in remote areas such as char, haor, coastal, and hilly regions face numerous challenges due to a lack of information. Parents in these areas also have concerns about their daughters' safety, which can contribute to early marriages.

Despite the decrease in the dropout rate due to scholarships, in backward regions, the number of dropouts increased to 60 lakhs after the SSC examinations according to a 2018 report. There is a need for more accurate data in these areas.

To help children get career-related information, CARE and UNFPA's booklet called ""Amar Shwopno, Amar Golpo"" can be distributed in educational institutes after review by the education department. Additionally, the digital version of the booklet can also be uploaded to an app.

Another significant challenge is sexual harassment, and educational institutions should ensure preventive measures and response mechanism.

Natasha Kader, Acting Head of Women Banking, Eastern Bank Ltd

Our goal is to create a comprehensive, one-stop service for women and girls where they can access financial support and banking services without any hassle. To accomplish this, we offer preferential schemes for our female customers, including access to financial education and support.

We understand that many girls and women do not have access to digital platforms, which is why we prioritize providing network and information access as a means of empowering them.

Additionally, we strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment in our banks, where girls and women feel comfortable and valued.

Nadeea Khandker, Focal Person, Media Communication & Sustainability, Robi

We believe that providing financial and mental support at the secondary education level, where the dropout rate is high, is crucial for the future of girls. It's important to extend our help to keep their imagination alive and empower them to reach their full potential.

Md. Shawkat Hossain, Member Secretary-NEARS and Consultant, Mariestopes Bangladesh

Reproductive health education is essential for adolescent girls, but in Bangladesh, access to reproductive services is limited to those who are married. This presents a significant problem for unmarried girls. While there are no official documents prohibiting services for unmarried individuals, government officials have not yet taken action to change this traditional attitude. Removing the requirement for marriage status would be a simple solution.

Frontline health workers (Family Welfare Visitors) should be well trained to ensure adolescent-friendly SRHR services.

The government should implement a mandatory reservation system for girls in all skills development programs to address these issues.

Sadia Karim, Adolescents-Youth and Gender Specialist, Educo Bangladesh

To empower women, we must work to promote the idea that household tasks are the responsibility of all members of the household, not just women. Until this happens, it will be difficult for women to fully develop as individuals, regardless of how many skills they acquire.

Moreover, females in Bangladesh have only 4% of land rights, according to a 2014 report by the International Land Coalition. This is a significant concern, as lack of access to resources can further marginalize and vulnerable women.

Women also lack leadership skills due to societal belittlement, which limits their ability to access and participate in public spaces.

While it is important for women to have self-defense skills, it is also important to promote mutual respect between genders.

Ram Chandra Das, Former Director General, Department of Women Affairs

Generally, we do not let our girls be aware of their potential. The parents and guardians should be made aware before creating any scopes for girls' possibilities and development.

I recommend a common toll-free number for every mobile operator to be established. This will enable easy access to the helpline, similar to the dedicated number 109 provided by the Department of Women Affairs, which is available 24/7 throughout the year.

Additionally, a directorate should be established to specifically address issues related to adolescent girls and boys. This will ensure that their unique needs are being met and that the resources and support are directed to where they are most needed.

Dr. Muhammad Munir Hussain, Program Analyst- A&Y, UNFPA Bangladesh

To achieve gender equality and empower women and girls, it is essential to educate our male children on mutual respect for the opposite gender.

The new curriculum core committee has been working for the last four years under the leadership of NCTB. The grade six curriculum added a table about menstruation and ejaculation. More crucial sexual and reproductive health information will be added in grades 8 and 9 this year.

We are trying to build a platform in the Ministry of Education where NGOs and other organizations work on SRHR.

Tanjim Ferdous, In-Charge, NGOs & Foreign Missions section of the Business Development team, The Daily Star & Moderator of the session

In Bangladesh, both in rural and urban settings, the full potential of adolescent girls remains untapped. To ensure their participation in economic activities, we need a mechanism where all stakeholders including civil society organizations, corporations, NGOs, and government agencies will work together under one umbrella. Only through active collaboration and participation from all stakeholders can we bring about effective change.

552,Disability-inclusive National Budget 2023-24,"Perspective on the post-COVID effect and global economic recession

Access Bangladesh Foundation in association with The Daily Star, DCF, NCDW, Sitakund Federation, TurningPoint and WDDF, and with the support of Disability Rights Fund, organised a virtual discussion titled ""Disability-inclusive National Budget 2023-24: Perspective on the post-COVID effect and global economic recession'' on December 18, 2022. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Albert Mollah, Co-Founder and Executive Director, Access Bangladesh Foundation

Access Bangladesh Foundation is conducting local and national campaigns to make the national budget more inclusive for people with disabilities. The purpose of this virtual discussion ahead of the budget's release is to ensure that our recommendations are reflected in the final draft.

Typically, disabled people receive direct benefits in two main categories: disability allowance and education stipend. There are specific allocations for institutions such as neuro-developmental disability protection trust and national academy for autism and neuro-development. Only 0.42% of the total budget is allocated for this group, or 2.52% if converted to safety net funding. We believe this is inadequate.

Bangladesh is a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and has national documents, such as action plans, legislation, and policy documents, that aim to protect the rights of people with disabilities. The 8th Five-Year Plan, which focuses on promoting prosperity and fostering inclusiveness, includes a specific direction to foster the inclusion of people with disabilities. However, these are not reflected in the budget.

The Plan mentions issues related to people with disabilities, such as education, health, and accessibility. For example, the government has mentioned taking appropriate social protection measures, such as child dependency benefits for young children and school-age children, adult disability benefits for young and working-age adults, and pension for old age. Is the budget being prepared with these aspects in mind?

If the government addresses private organizations and NGOs' recommendations, it will help fulfill global commitments and implement local policy documents. We cannot achieve the goals of the UNCRPD and SDGs solely with the budget of the Ministry of Social Welfare.

The social welfare ministry, health ministry, and education ministry must work together and involve every relevant ministry in the process of allocating a substantial budget for people with disabilities. Without this, we won't be able to mainstream these people and realize the benefits of an inclusive society.

It is essential to ensure direct interaction between people with disabilities and the government to assess their needs and current situation. If the government decides to reduce certain facilities in the future, considering the post-COVID situation and current global economic crisis, it will not be justified for these people.

Tanjim Ferdous, In Charge, NGOs & Foreign Missions section of the Business Development Team, The Daily Star

According to research jointly conducted by BBS and the Ministry of Planning, 1.43% of Bangladeshi people live with disabilities. It will be impossible to achieve the SDG goals if these people are left out of the mainstream development process in Bangladesh.

It is important to find ways to support these people by ensuring their needs, such as job opportunities, education, and health, are met in the coming years, especially during the impending global economic crisis caused by COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war.

Nasima Akter, President, National Council of Disabled Women (NCDW)

The rate of violence against women with disabilities also increased during the pandemic due to a lack of caregivers and basic healthcare facilities, as well as a lack of opportunities for in-person communication and coordination with protection providers due to COVID-19. Additionally, we were unable to provide legal support to these people due to a lack of funding.

Bangladesh's graduation as a Least Developed Country (LDC) impacts overall funding, particularly for people with disabilities. In addition, the incentives provided by the government during and after the COVID-19 pandemic for people with disabilities were not sufficient due to certain requirements. For example, many persons with disabilities were unable to access government incentives because they did not have a Shuborno Nagarik Card.

If appropriate steps are not taken to ensure the proactive involvement of organizations of persons with disabilities, relevant ministries, departments, and the directorate, we will not be able to bring real change to the lives of these people.

Nazrana Yeasmin (Hira),

Coordinator Programme, Manusher Jonno Foundation

The former finance minister used to contact us to hold roundtable discussions on how to create a budget for people with disabilities by assessing their needs. However, we have not had such opportunities in recent years. We want the opportunity to sit with the finance ministry and other relevant ministries to ensure that the necessary budget is allocated for people with disabilities.

Despite having inclusive laws such as the RTI law (Right to Information), the Disaster Management Act 2012, education policies, women's development policies, the standing order on disability, and the national skill development policy in Bangladesh, our budget is not yet inclusive.

Murteza Rafi Khan,

Chief Executive Officer, Bangladesh Business and Disability Network (BBDN)

In many cases, when the development partner leaves after completing a project, the sustainability of the intervention is uncertain. There is no budget allocation for this, and there is no plan to ensure that disability inclusion is embedded programmatically within these departments and the ministry. Instead of a project-based approach, we must treat this as a regular task.

In 2020 the government announced a tax incentive, allocating a 5% tax incentive for a 10% inclusion rate, which was still high. In 2022, the rate was adjusted again, allowing employers to receive a tax rebate for 75% of the salary of 25 people they hire. However, employers believe that this amount is still not sufficient incentive for them to adopt this approach. A simple slab system could make the mechanism more transparent and easier to implement

Amrita Rejina Rozario,

Country Director, Sightsavers Bangladesh

The upcoming budget should be viewed through the lens of disability and include extra costs in all areas to accommodate people with disabilities. There should be an allocated budget for accessibility and assistive devices to ensure that people with disabilities receive a quality education and have equal employment opportunities.

The International Day of Persons with Disabilities 2022 emphasized the theme of 'innovation,' which also requires budget allocation. The Eighth Five-Year Plan addresses the issue of disability well, and the government is also keen to work on the issue. We hope that the next budget will reflect the directives of the Eighth Five-Year Plan.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many children with disabilities discontinued their education due to a lack of allowance. We hope that 100% of children with disabilities will receive stipends.

Vashkar Bhattacharjee, National Consultant-Accessibility, a2i

This year, the government ratified the Marrakesh Treaty, which makes it easier to produce and transfer specially-adapted books for persons with visual disabilities. To efficiently implement this treaty, we need specific budget allocation. A trusted intermediary of selected institutions is needed to produce these books, along with an online repository for preserving them.

a2i is working on four aspects to increase acceptance of people with disabilities on both private and public platforms. This includes training corporates and having people with disabilities work as accessibility auditors. a2i is also making 70% of e-services and websites accessible and creating national web-accessibility guidelines and a national portal plug-in with features such as color and font size changes, underlining, reading guide, and free screen reading software. They are also focusing on availability by providing free laptops through the Ministry of Information Communication Technology and working to provide no-cost or low-cost technology to persons with disabilities. Finally, a2i is creating awareness through citizen talks, promotional materials, and celebrating Global Accessibility Awareness Day. The challenge is how we can sustain and expand these initiatives, which require more financial support. The Ministry of Social Welfare should advocate for inclusivity in the budget so that other relevant ministries can take appropriate actions.

Farjana Reza, National Programme Officer, Social Protection, International Labour Organisation (ILO)

Social protection has two key aspects: social insurance, which goes beyond government allocation and depends on private and business initiatives and other budget sources that should be explored, and active labor market policy, which provides opportunities for marginalized communities, such as people with disabilities, to engage in income-generating activities and contribute to the economy. The budget should have a reflection on how the state will ensure access of persons with disabilities to the labour market.

This year, ILO is starting a national employment injury insurance scheme under the supervision of the government's Ministry of Labour and Employment. The scheme is intended to provide coverage for accidents at work for 4 million workers in the RMG sector. In addition, we are working to create a universal social protection program that provides support from childhood to work, in partnership with the government and other UN organizations.

Jowaherul Islam Mamun, Mentor, SWID Bangladesh

We have noticed that those who are autistic or have behavioral issues require 24-hour care for things such as toileting, transportation, and so on, which can be both exhausting and costly. While there is an allowance for caregivers worldwide, we have some facilities for people with disabilities but no arrangement for caregivers. I request the Minister to allocate an allowance for caregivers in the next budget.

The Protection of Persons with Neuro-developmental Disability Trust Act was formulated in 2013, but it has not yet been implemented.

Ashrafun Nahar Misti, Executive Director, Women with Disabilities Development Foundation

We need to prioritize inclusive health from the outset as this issue is often undervalued. Inclusivity involves addressing the specific needs of people with disabilities. Children with disabilities require support for early detection as parents may be concerned about their child's lifelong special needs. We need a proper initiative, particularly for female children with disabilities, to ensure early detection, which should be led by the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Social Welfare may not be able to provide this service.

After detection, there are steps that need to be taken to improve mobility and maintain physical stability for people with disabilities to become self-sufficient. For example, they may need physiotherapy, psychological therapy, or speech therapy. The health ministry needs to provide sufficient training for these therapists and ensure their travel to local hospitals, which requires a budget.

Iftekhar Mahmud, Coordinator, Bangladesh Society for the Change and Advocacy Nexus (B-Scan)

The allowance for persons with disabilities in Bangladesh should be increased in accordance with our per capita income, as all of our neighboring countries' allocation for a person with a disability is greater.

In Nepal, allowance is given to persons with disabilities in accordance with the complexities of their disability. In Bangladesh, identity cards have been issued to persons with disabilities since 2015, but the complexity level of the disability is not mentioned on the card. As a result, those with severe disabilities are not receiving an adequate allowance. The government in Bangladesh is now planning to provide smart cards to persons with disabilities, and it is important that the severity of the disability is included on these cards.

Nasrin Jahan, Executive Director, Disabled Child Foundation

In 2015, regulations were developed based on the Persons with Disabilities Rights and Protection Act of 2013. The law established five committees at the city, district, sub-district, and ministry levels (executive and coordination committees). However, most of these committees have not yet been formed using the standard framework and their meetings are not regular.

There should be three meetings per year, but in the past nine years, only five meetings have taken place, two of which were online during the COVID period. The current situation is a result of a lack of adequate manpower, logistics support, and budget to organize and monitor these meetings.

The ministry of social welfare should provide clear instructions and allocate a budget for these committees. A chain of command should also be established for reporting from each committee.

Dilip Kumar Ghosh, President, National Forum of Organisations Working with the Disabled (NFOWD)

The budget should be allocated in accordance with the activities of different ministries. It is also important to consider cases involving persons with disabilities, such as disinheritance, lack of sign language interpreters for taking witness statements, and oppression, while planning the budget. These issues need to be addressed in order to ensure that the rights of persons with disabilities are protected.

Badiul Alam, President, National Alliance of Disabled Peoples Organisations (NADPO)

Most of the Organizations of Persons with Disabilities (OPDs) are localized and do not have any international funding but they are playing an important role to ensure better lives for people with disabilities along with the government. There should be an allotted budget for these OPDs smooth operations.

Md. Ashraf Ali Khan Khasru, MP, Honourable State Minister, Ministry of Social Welfare (MoSW)

The current government is working continuously to implement programs that support disabled people and improve their lives and livelihoods. One such program is the provision of a monthly allowance of BDT 850 to insolvent persons with disabilities. Additionally, students with disabilities are receiving stipends based on their grades at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education. This is a significant initiative by the government. Other programs include providing cochlear implants facility at government hospitals across the country and the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream schools.

Unfortunately, good initiatives are often hindered by unscrupulous practices. For example, the program to establish special schools for children with disabilities and enroll functioning private special schools under MPO has been disrupted due to unethical actions by interested parties. The number of students in special schools, according to statistics, does not match the national statistics. As a result, this program has been interrupted.

Budget is not a major obstacle. However, transparency, accountability, and sincerity are necessary to achieve this. We must prevent opportunists from corrupting the system. It is important for all stakeholders to ensure that the allocated budget is used properly. Other stakeholders should support the government in educating citizens about these issues through seminars and advertisements.

553,Holistic approach imperative to end malnutrition and gender inequality among adolescents,"Joint Action for Nutrition Outcome (JANO), in association with The Daily Star, organized a roundtable titled ""Adolescent Nutrition, Health and Gender Awareness: JANO's Experiences & Recommendations"" on 10 December 2022 at Begum Rokeya Auditorium of RDRS Bangladesh in Rangpur. Here we publish a summary of the discussion

Professor S M Abdul Motin Laskor

Director, Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education, Rangpur Region, Rangpur

Under an MoU with the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DHSE), the JANO project is working with the schools in Rangpur and Nilphamari districts. JANO has set an example in terms of activating students for nutrition gardening which should be replicated all over Bangladesh. A nation cannot thrive without meeting the nutrition requirements of its citizens. If Bangladesh has to make an international presence, we must focus on nutrition with greater importance. Government and development partners must work shoulder to shoulder to achieve this target. I had the chance to go to school just immediately after the independence of Bangladesh. Even at that time, the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, emphasized on school gardening and seeds were provided to us for plantation at school and home. Now, the time has come to realize the dream of the Father of Nation to make Bangladesh a healthy nation, meeting the nutrition demand of all. We must not forget that we have 50 million adolescents and youths in our country; if we fail to ensure nutrition for them, we will never be able to be recognized both nationally and internationally.

Afroz Mahal

Director, Programme Management and Implementation

Plan International Bangladesh

The once in lifetime opportunity for Bangladesh having benefit of demographic dividend where 32% of the country's population are below 30 years of age and 21% of them are adolescents. It indicates that collectively we should grab and maximize the huge potential to build the nation for the better. So civil society needs to act fast and collaborate with the government to transform this large workforce and grow their potential at large. Bangladesh has demonstrated tremendous achievement in various indicators of the SDGs. However, many reasons, including the adverse impact of COVID-19, has affected the progress, especially to fulfill the gender equity indicator. There exist certain normative and stereotyped practices such as harmful gender norms and roles prevailing in society where women's role only limit to childcare and household chores. Women giving birth to children is a significant responsibility and sometimes it puts them in a life-threatening situation due to ignorance and undervalued position in the family and society. Even in our subconscious mind, we often practice unequal treatment when it comes to girl and boy children. In Bangladesh, we have many policies and plans that guide us on what to do to eliminate this discrimination. If we go through the Government's Nutrition Action Plan, we will see nutrition has been defined as a cross-cutting agenda for different sectoral interventions and is not confined to health only. In collaboration with the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DHSE), Plan Bangladesh has implemented the GEMS curriculum in 1004 schools and madrasas, which is playing a role in terms of developing knowledge on gender equity and adolescent health. Plan International has a global target to empower 200 million girls who will act as change-makers. As this project approach to end, we plan to have a series of consultations with various stakeholders for their thoughts and suggestions that will help us in shaping our current and future work as part of organizational commitment.

Dr. Md. Shahid Uz Zaman

Founder and Executive Director, ESDO

Eco-Social Development Organization or ESDO is the implementing partner of the JANO project. Three indicators are important to consider when we think about food and nutrition security: access, availability, and utility. The beauty of the JANO project is that it has touched upon all these three aspects. There are many good lessons learned from the JANO project which should be scaled up. JANO has created an evidence-based outcome and it has been possible due to the support extended by the relevant government department. We need to focus on the sustainability of the successes related to gender awareness, adolescent health and nutrition produced by JANO project and for this, more policy advocacy is necessary at different levels.

Md Ashik Billah

Head of the Central and Northern Region Programme

Plan International Bangladesh

JANO has created some positive evidence in terms of how we can address the challenge of food security and the global food crisis. The fundamental concept of JANO is to promote awareness on adolescent health, nutrition and gender equality and to enhance the learning to practice in day-to-day life. JANO has focused on 'nutrition gardening' in households and schools. Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) has some designated persons like; Sub-Assistant Agriculture Officer (SAAO) who works at union level and can be engaged with project activities to sustain these kinds of unique activities. JANO also initiated the adolescent corner at school, which becomes a learning center for adolescent girls and boys on many important issues related to their adolescent period and it can be scaled up by the government all over Bangladesh.

Mohammad Faiz Kawsar

Project Manager-JANO

Plan International Bangladesh

JANO project is playing a supporting role to the government of Bangladesh to achieve our country's nutrition goals and targets associated with the SDGs of the Bangladesh Government. Care Bangladesh, Plan International Bangladesh and Eco-Social Development Organization (ESDO) are implementing JANO project in a consortium with the funding of the European Union and co-funding by Austrian Development Cooperation. JANO is playing the supporting role in Rangpur and Nilphamari districts with twenty-two ministries of the government working on achieving nutrition targets in Bangladesh. Knowledge and awareness are being raised and strengthened within communities in areas to contribute to ending malnutrition of children under five years of age, together with addressing the nutritional needs of Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) and adolescent girls, to increase the awareness of appropriate hygiene behaviour, and adoption of nutrition-sensitive, nutrition specific services and climate-smart-agriculture techniques. The project is contributing to the government system to implement the Second National Plan of Action for Nutrition (NPAN 2). JANO has produced a number of successes such as climate-smart vegetable gardening, adolescent corners in schools and Union Health and Family Welfare Centre (UH&FWC), theatre for development for community etc. One key feature of the JANO project is Gender Equity Movement in Schools (GEMS) curriculum which has been implemented in 297 secondary schools and madrasas in JANO project districts. The good thing is that GEMS in schools will now be scaled up all over Bangladesh. We, therefore, must be careful how this concept can be successfully implemented to make effective results. JANO has initiated vegetable gardening (climate-smart garden) in 331 schools from project working areas. JANO is working with the Nutrition Coordination Committees so that they implement effective nutritional programmes within their regions. The private sector is also seen as a major systemic partner as JANO is motivating and encouraging businesses to invest in local markets. The project provided support to Bangladesh National Nutrition Council (BNNC) to develop the web-based nutrition activity monitoring platform. Now this is under countrywide scaleup. Women and girls are at the centre of JANO activities that adhere to a gender-transformational approach for a gender-equal environment. JANO has successfully introduced co-curricular activities such as karate self-defense training that boosted the confidence of the adolescents. Moreover, JANO has shown tremendous success in making students and adolescents interested in gardening and agriculture as a means to meet nutritional needs.

Md Akhtaruzzaman

Deputy Director, Secondary

and Higher Education, Rangpur Region, Rangpur

Nutrition garden is an excellent innovation of this project which enabled the students to gain knowledge on climate-smart agriculture and they are practicing the learning in daily life. Child marriage is still a big concern in many schools, including government schools. Along with adolescent corners and school gardening activities, JANO's intervention in reducing child marriage will also be great. The modality and best practice can be replicated in other schools in the country. And all adolescent girls must get iron-folic acid tablets or iron supplements. The Gender Equity Movement in Schools (GEMS) curriculum implementation at the school and madrasa level is one of the successful interventions of JANO project for the education system.

Dr. Shamim Ahmed

Civil Surgeon, Rangpur

Achieving nutrition targets needs multidimensional coordination and there is no alternative to it. Nutrition is not a business of any given ministry. Without multisectoral and multi-ministerial coordination, it will not be possible to achieve sustainable nutrition goals. 22 ministries have been assigned by the government, and district, sub-district, and union parishad level coordination committees are formed to carry out nutrition activities. Political commitment and public awareness are also very important to end malnutrition. The Constitution of Bangladesh (18.2) mentions that the State shall regard raising the level of nutrition and improving public health as among its primary duties. The development partners have a role to play in advancing the coordination among different government stakeholders for improving results. JANO project is playing a vital role with the government for nutrition-related activities, especially the function of the Union Development Coordination Committee (UDCC), Upazila Nutrition Coordination Committee (UNCC) and District Nutrition Coordination Committee (DNCC) to effectively implement the Nutrition Action Plan under Rangpur and Nilphamari Districts including standard practices of the government system. JANO is a good example of joint implementation with the government with an integrated approach.

Md. Shafiqul Islam

District Education Officer, Nilphamari

There are 216 schools in Nilphamari districts where JANO project activities are being implemented. Under the nutrition governance project, some selected teachers from these schools have been provided with training on adolescent nutrition, health and gender awareness with the great collaboration of the Department of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) & National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB). We have observed that teachers have become more sensitized and careful about adolescent nutrition, health and gender awareness after receiving the training. The school garden turned into an interesting and enjoyable learning activity that makes the students happy, hyperactive and conscious about their health and nutrition. They are practicing their learning at home and sharing it with others which is more efficient in terms of spreading knowledge and awareness.

Shegufta Nasrin

Assistant Teacher, Afan Ullah High School, Rangpur

I started working with the JANO project in 2019. The objectives of the project interested me a lot. While working on the project, I came to realize that JANO is considering a holistic approach to address nutrition, considering health and gender awareness within it. Mental and physical health are closely associated with nutrition and gender equity. I worked as a master trainer of the Gender Equity Movement in Schools (GEMS) initiative under JANO and educated students about adolescent nutrition and health, cleanliness, menstrual hygiene, and helped them prepare a food and diet chart to follow to ensure nutritional requirements. Since each school has a physical instructor/teacher, and a new subject named health protection is being introduced in 2023, the concept of GEMS can be implemented all over Bangladesh.

Md. Shamimur Rahman

Additional Deputy Director

Department of Agricultural Extension, Rangpur

Adolescent nutrition, health and gender awareness is a highly important issue for Bangladesh to address. Schools are an essential medium because if we can help aware our students about the knowledge and importance of adolescent nutrition, health and gender awareness, there will be a high-level positive impact in the long run. The reality is that students are not very interested in learning about nutrition, which causes a lack of knowledge. Parents are also equally ignorant. We, as guardians, have an additional responsibility to learn and educate our children about nutrition. Each family should have a food chart and a person should eat 200-250 grams of vegetables and 100-150 grams of fruits per day It is mandatory, but we do not follow it. We need to disseminate this kind of knowledge among our students and parents through schools.

ATM Nazmul Huda

Assistant Director, Family Planning, Rangpur

Despite our efforts, Bangladesh's achievements in various nutrition indicators are quite low in comparison to many poor countries, including several African countries. Stunting results from chronic malnutrition, which retards linear growth, whereas wasting results from inadequate nutrition over a shorter period, and underweight encompasses both stunting and wasting. Family Planning and JANO are working together to address these challenges. With the support of the JANO project, the Directorate General of Family Planning (DGFP) has provided training to Family Planning health workers on adolescent nutrition, health, and gender awareness. Family Planning Department has a School health education module which has been developed in consultation with various agencies, including the DGFP. In our Union Health & Family Welfare Centre (UH&FWC) premises, we have adolescent corners and based on availability, we provide sanitary napkins and iron folic acid tablets. However, we have limited human resources which we need to overcome to perform better.

Antora Roy

Adolescent Representative

I was unaware of the importance of nutrition, reproductive health, and safety before. Then JANO came and initiated adolescent corners and GEMS sessions in school with the support of the school authority. Now, we can discuss our issues and problems in the adolescent corners and learn about adolescent health and changes. The female adolescents in our community did not know about the use of sanitary napkins during the menstrual period, but now, many of us know about the importance of using sanitary napkins and the risks of using unsafe clothes/napkins. JANO also has Theatre for Development Shows, which educated us about the negative consequences of child marriage, the importance of menstrual hygiene, reproductive health etc. JANO project initiative has contributed to building my knowledge and confidence. Now I am confident to apply my learnings on vegetable gardening at the household level, able to support other adolescents in calculating individual BMI calculation, balance diet and food hygiene.

Md Mosaraf Hossain

Assistant Inspector

Bangladesh Madrasa Education Board, Rangpur

Educational Institutions play a big part in addressing concerns with adolescents, health, nutrition, hygiene, and gender. Although the curricula and environments of various educational institutions vary, it is crucial to consider the context and circumstances of Madrasha Education in Bangladesh. For instance, female madrasah instructors might be more engaged in the SRHR concerns of adolescent girls. However, if the adolescence corners can be established in all the madrasas, they will play an important role in promoting knowledge on adolescent nutrition, health and gender awareness among the students.

Md. Anisur Rahman

Manager-Capacity Building

JANO Project, Care Bangladesh

JANO project has gathered lots of experience. Apart from school-going adolescents, JANO has also extensively worked for out-of-school adolescents as they cannot avail many of the services provided in the schools. A budget is needed for school or nutrition gardening, and the existing multisectoral committees at the district and sub-district levels should think about how to find the budget for this practice from government sources. If adolescent corners can be established in all areas, they can significantly contribute to the life of adolescents from these areas.

Tajnim Ferdous

In-Charge, NGOs & Foreign Missions, The Daily Star

Several important recommendations have come up from the discussion. One of the most important things discussed here is students can learn about adolescent nutrition, health and gender issues from the schools, which is very effective. This is something that should not remain confined to the JANO working areas but all over Bangladesh if we want to reap the advantages of demographic dividends in the coming decades. Taking steps to end child marriage is another important task that we must consider while dealing with malnutrition, as child marriage and malnutrition are inexplicably associated with each other. Ensuring the availability of iron and folic acid tablets for adolescents is required. Given that nutrition needs a multisectoral approach and initiatives, it should be considered from education, livelihood, health and social protection perspectives.

Key Recommended Action

♦ A holistic approach should be taken to meet the nutritional needs of adolescents.

♦ Adolescent school-goers should have basic knowledge and information on Adolescent health, nutrition, and gender equity.

♦ Iron folic acid tablets or iron supplements should be provided to all adolescent girls through the government system.

♦ The concept of school/nutrition gardening should be scaled up across Bangladesh in the education system.

♦ More engagement of the agriculture department to promote and establish school vegetable gardens.

♦ Arable land can be used to grow fresh and nutritious vegetables at home to meet daily nutrition needs.

♦ Effective coordination and partnership of government, non-government and other relevant stakeholders can be proved as the most effective way to promote adolescent-friendly health facilities.

♦ Concerted effort is needed to ensure the menstrual and health hygiene of adolescent girls.

♦ Gender equity must be promoted and practiced through curriculum and educational institutions in order to have an impact at the family, household, and community levels.

♦ Parents and guardians should be provided with the proper knowledge on nutritional values, adolescent health, and hygiene which will be helpful to guide their adolescents.",2023-01-20 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/roundtables/news/holistic-approach-imperative-end-malnutrition-and-gender-inequality-among-adolescents-3234121,2023-05-18 10:30:11,thedailystar
554,Dissemination Workshop on Strengthening Family Planning through Advocacy: Learnings and Opportunities,"Marie Stopes Bangladesh has been working in Bangladesh since 1988 with a mission that translates Children by Choice, not Chance. It has been providing high-quality sexual and reproductive healthcare across the country and significantly contributing to the government's goal of reducing maternal and child deaths.

As a part of its mandates, since 2016 with the technical support of Advance Family Planning, Marie Stopes Bangladesh and its partners AVAS, Serac, Shushilan, and Team Associate have been implementing a project titled ""Strengthening Family Planning through Advocacy"" to strengthen government's health systems and infrastructure in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Directorate General of Family Planning and civil society organizations. The project is going to end, thereby sharing the project's achievements, learnings, and future directions to achieve Bangladesh's commitments to Family Planning 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, Marie Stopes Bangladesh has organized an impact dissemination workshop on 10th December 2022. In the workshop, the Chief guest was Md. Saiful Hassan Badal, the honorable Secretary, of the Medical Education and Family Welfare Division; Dr. Ashrafi Ahmed, NDC, Additional Secretary, of the Medical Education, and Family Welfare Division; Abdus Salam Khan, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare; Shahin Islam, NDC, Director General, National Institute for Mass Communication; Mervyn Christian, Advance Family Planning, Senior Program Officer; Johns Hopkins, Bloomberg School of Public Health; Dr. Nurun Nahar, Line Director, CCDDP, DGFP and Dr. Mahmudur Rahman, Director, MCH unit, DGFP along with other respected guests.

At the beginning of the dissemination, Ms. Monjun Nahar, the Lead Advocacy, shared that Advance Family Planning (AFP) in collaboration with civil society organizations, family planning experts, and the Government of Bangladesh, worked together to achieve critical success using the SMART advocacy approach. They i) secured local funding for family planning; ii) expanded access to quality contraceptive services; iii) strengthened Bangladesh's commitment to accountability; iv) improved the visibility of family planning through media; and v) galvanized civil society as a powerhouse.

Mr. Kishwar Imdad, Country Director, Marie Stopes Bangladesh expressed his gratefulness to all the respected guests. He said that Marie Stopes Bangladesh has been working since 1988 in Bangladesh to promote women's health and to ensure women's choices and rights. He thanked the Advance Family Planning, Johns Hopkins University for their support to Marie Stopes Bangladesh. Also, thanked the government officials for their cooperation. He said that MSB is committed to promoting gender equality by promoting women's and girls' choices and rights on their reproductive health issues.

Md. Saiful Hasan Badal, the Secretary of the Medical Education and Family Welfare Division, remarked that in Bangladesh, family planning has been one of the top priorities in the 4th Health Sector Programme as a path toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. He said that the Ministry has strengthened its efforts to increase trained service providers, including deploying midwives to all sub-district hospitals; improving supervision of family planning services by placing clinical teams in all districts; and engaging the private sector for addressing gaps in service provision and supply of commodities.

Additional Secretary, of Medical Education and Family Welfare Division, MOHFW, Dr. Ashrafi Ahmed, NDC said that the AFP project contributed to creating scope to work jointly in a platform with GO/NGO/civil society for promoting the health rights of women. The project has demonstrated that organized collaboration of multi-sectoral groups, leveraging the knowledge and skills of advocates, and an effective advocacy strategy, can contribute significantly to strengthening accountability.

Shahin Islam NDC, DG of the National Institute of Mass Communication mentioned that three issues are important for women empowerment- intellectual, mental, and physical strength. And to increase the physical strength of women, they need to take FP services. Therefore, it is important to increase access and availability of quality family planning services which AFP, MSB is doing.

Abdus Salam Khan, Joint Secretary, MOHFW said that they are working to reduce unmet needs, and dropout rates, and ensure institutional delivery. Model Union Health and Family Welfare centers provide 24/7 maternal care including institutional childbirth. The initiative is also helping to promote post-partum family planning. One of the priorities is for private-public partnerships to cover all the reproductive-aged people, especially women and girls of the country.

The initiative of the project to involve Private Medical College and Hospitals unlocked a new arena by opening FP corners for increasing FP access and gradually other medical colleges will replicate it--Iffat Ara

Our Medical colleges and hospitals are willingly taking the challenge of setting up FP corners and successfully providing FP services. Prof. Dr. Sehereen F. Siddiqua, Head of Gynecology and Obstetrics and Laparoscopic Surgeon, Anwar Khan Modern Cardiac Hospital, hopes that other private medical colleges could take the supplementary role.

We know how to manage and secure local budgets for FP services from the UP. - Advocate Shahneyaj Mili, a District Advocacy working member.

MSB has contributed to changing some policies and procedures like approval of tubal hook, uterine elevators, laparoscopic approach, local anesthetic, infection-prevention guidelines for IUD, etc. Besides, an initiative for the development of an FP strategy for hard-to-reach areas will create more access to contraceptives where people lack access to services. -Dr. Nurun Nahar, Line Director, CCSDP, DGFP

Dr. Prof. Ainoon Naher, Jahangir Nagar University says he has found the approach for advocacy is unique to influence decision makers as it is evidence and solution based. He hopes the social advocate will be benefited by using the SMART advocacy too.

Mervyn Christian, Senior Program Officer at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore said that AFP's achievements on policy and programmatic advances to improve the quality of care and expanding the availability of family planning services in hard-to-reach areas are evidence of AFP's strong partnership with government and civil society and the government's commitment to ensure quality family planning services for all. He thanked the government officials, and civil society organizations for their support of the project.

Quazi Mohiul Islam, Former DG, DGFP said that family planning is one of the pre-conditions to reduce maternal death and is key to leading a healthy life. It is not about only contraception, rather it is a lifestyle.

From the learning of the advocates and experts, the project gave some critical Recommendations to take further actions",2023-01-09 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/roundtables/news/dissemination-workshop-strengthening-family-planning-through-advocacy-learnings-and-opportunities-3216926,2023-05-18 10:30:12,thedailystar
555,"Saving mother nature, saving us","The role of youth in leading conservation and climate resilience

USAID in association with The Daily Star organised a roundtable titled 'Saving mother nature, saving us – The role of youth in leading conservation and climate resilience' on December 18, 2022. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Zunaed Rabbani, Founder & CEO, The Right Kind & Moderator of the session

The world is in trouble and it's time we take responsibility for the mess we've created. When we look around, we see people and the planet in pain and struggle. It's important that we show more care and kindness to the world by cleaning up our mess and taking action to address the challenges we face, particularly climate change.

As a parent, I try to teach my children about sharing and being considerate of others. But I also have to look at my own actions and consider whether I'm doing enough to show that I care.

It's crucial that we have discussions about the challenges and urgency of addressing climate change, and highlight successful initiatives, such as those by the government of Bangladesh and other partners, in mitigating its impact. We need to set the table for a call to action under a youth-led climate change and conservation campaign.

Dr. Ainun Nishat, Water Resource and Climate Change Specialist & Emeritus Professor, BRAC University

It is vital to include the voices of youth in discussions about climate change issues. However, a lack of accurate knowledge can be a major obstacle in this regard. For example, many top government officials, parliamentarians, and professors may not understand the difference between disaster mitigation and climate change mitigation. It is essential that we have a clear understanding of these terms.

I encourage young people to seek out accurate knowledge and to link it to local conditions. Building capacity and improving local situations, as well as increasing resilience, are also important. It is through a combination of knowledge and action that we can make progress in addressing climate change and its impacts.

Bangladesh has signed over 50 conventions related to biodiversity conservation, but do we have a plan for how to implement them? This is an area where youth can make a difference. If young people have a thorough understanding of conservation and how to ensure it, they can advocate for the appropriate actions to be taken by the government.

Change does not happen without activism, and powerful activism can lead to the government taking necessary actions. It is important for youth to clearly define their role and make their own decisions. I believe that youth have the potential to lead the discussion on important issues and move the world in a positive direction, but this requires a strong knowledge base and a combination of advocacy and activism.

Muhammad N Khan, Director, Economic Growth Office, USAID

We know that Bangladesh is one of the most climate vulnerable countries. Addressing climate change is also a core priority of the United States government, particularly under the Biden administration.

In our work in the Sundarbans wetland ecosystems, located in the northern Sylhet division and Chittagong Hill Tracts, we advocate for a co-management approach that involves working with communities and the government to protect natural resources and critical ecosystems, as well as introducing alternative livelihood options for communities that are traditionally dependent on forest resources.

USAID will continue to promote nature-based and clean energy solutions, ecotourism, and private sector investments that prioritize diversity and ecosystem conservation. We are also planning new initiatives to expand protection for endangered species and their habitats.

To be successful in addressing climate change, it is essential that we increase coordination and collaboration among all stakeholders, from the highest levels of government to youth across the country. We are particularly focused on empowering young people to develop solutions that are effective at the community level. This is why we are planning to roll out a campaign over the coming months that will engage youth in areas where our projects are active, encouraging their active participation and amplifying their voices and ideas. By working together, we can make a meaningful impact in addressing the challenges of climate change.

Syeda Rizwana Hasan, Chief Executive, Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA)

Protecting the environment is both a responsibility and a right. It is like a democracy, where everyone has a role to play. The young generation must question the development model that has been imposed on us by the West, as this exploitative model has led to environmental disasters like climate change. We must recognize that this consumption model is not sustainable and redefine our approach to development accordingly.

There are certain buzzwords in our society, such as ""recycle"" and ""genetically modified grains,"" but these concepts are not always as simple as they seem. For example, last year only 20% of the world's plastic was recycled. In Bangladesh, PET bottle recycling has started, but in Bangalore, a road is being made from recycled plastic. We must carefully consider the extent to which these practices are truly sustainable. The next generation must be aware of safe alternatives.

We don't have the ability to agree to false solutions that undermine nature. We can't create a river or another Sundarbans, so we don't have the right to destroy what we can't create. We must learn from our mistakes and not repeat them.

It is important for youth to know their rights and to speak up for justice without hesitation. They must also continue the dialogue for a better environment, or the next generation may not be able to draw the same map of Bangladesh as we have. Protecting the environment and preserving it for future generations is a shared responsibility that requires the participation and advocacy of all people, especially young people.

Md. Shamsuddoha, Chief Executive, Center for Participatory Research and Development (CPRD)

If we want to disseminate messages about climate change and loss and damage among youth and children, it is important to involve them in the process of activism and advocacy. Like many other developing countries, Bangladesh is taking steps to ensure youth participation in addressing these issues. It is essential that young people address the challenges and requirements at both the national and international level when it comes to climate justice and climate change.

There is a gap between the youth of urban and rural areas in Bangladesh, and the urbanized youth who study in English-medium schools often represent a consumerist group. It is necessary to integrate all young people and work on changing their mindset, behavior, and consumerism in order to build a more sustainable and equitable future.

Proper education and knowledge are essential for maintaining the neutrality of youth voices. To prepare young people for advocacy, it is important to create a supportive environment within communities that helps them become sensitive to issues related to climate change, climate justice, and resilience. By providing youth with the knowledge and tools they need, we can empower them to be effective advocates for the environment and the well-being of all people.

Md. Golam Rabbani, Head of Climate Bridge Fund Secretariat, BRAC

The role of youth in conservation and climate resilience is both practical and strategic. Today's youth will be the ones who will have to deal with the real impacts of climate change, such as rising temperatures and sea levels. According to the National Adaptation Plan of Bangladesh, the sea level is expected to rise by 0.3m to 3.9m in the country.

Youth are well-positioned to communicate messages about climate change adaptation and resilience within society. They have a vital role to play in long-term planning for both adaptation and resilience.

There are three major elements of climate resilience: exposure risk, social resilience, and economic resilience. Youth should be involved in communicating about these issues at all levels and should also be engaged in policy action. It is important for young people to be active and engaged in addressing the challenges of climate change and building a more sustainable and resilient future.

Shakila Sattar Trina, Founder, The Earth Society

Although many youths in Bangladesh are already taking action, their efforts are not always recognized or supported due to a lack of connection with the right stakeholders. It is important to provide young people with opportunities to share their ideas on various platforms and to nurture and facilitate the development of these ideas so that they can be connected with the right stakeholders.

In many cases, local-level initiatives with innovative and impactful ideas struggle due to a lack of a proper business model or difficulties with securing investment. It would be beneficial to have more impact-based investors who prioritize innovative and impactful ideas over profit when making investment decisions.

Instead of starting new initiatives from scratch, it would be more effective to connect existing ones and work together. This approach would be very helpful for youth who are trying to make a positive impact on climate change and conservation issues.

Muhammed Mohiuddin Sourav, Champion, The Daily Star – ActionAid Climate Justice Campaign,

Although conventional recycling is often promoted as a positive solution, it can have a significant negative impact on society. For example, it takes 3-12 kg of carbon to recycle 1 kg of plastic. We need to move beyond this conventional approach to recycling and explore other alternatives.

Additionally, the paper cups we use to drink tea and coffee often contain plastic, making them difficult to recycle.

We are currently working on bringing edible cutlery to market, which can be eaten after use. It is important to support action-oriented startups like ours that are working to combat climate change and find innovative solutions to environmental problems.

Dr Maliha Muzammil, Climate Finance Expert, UNDP Bangladesh

It is unfortunate that we often expect young people to come up with innovative ideas, but fail to provide adequate investment to support their efforts. It is important to allocate funding to youth-centric activities in both urban and rural areas, ensuring that all young people have the opportunity to pursue their initiatives.

To effectively address climate resilience and climate mitigation, it is necessary to involve small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and youth from both rural and urban areas. Many urban and rural entrepreneurs are involved in cottage, micro, small, and medium enterprises (CMSMEs), so it is important to focus on collaborative approaches that create linkages between youth and the private sector. By highlighting the opportunities available to young people, we can help them become more climate-resilient and make a meaningful impact on environmental issues.

Quamrul Islam Chowdhury, Chairman, Forum of Environmental Journalists of Bangladesh (FEJB)

Enhancing the knowledge base and skills of young people is crucial for generating innovative ideas to combat climate change. They need to engage in rigorous research to gain a deep understanding of these issues, and should be given opportunities to present their ideas and develop their negotiation skills on platforms such as conferences and international seminars.

In the past, youth movements in Bangladesh have been instrumental in establishing the Ministry of Environment and formulating environmental laws, banning polyethene, and phasing out three-wheelers from Dhaka city.

There are many areas where youth can make a significant impact on climate change and conservation in the future. For example, they can work on different aspects of the Green Climate Fund, adaptation funds, and the Least Developed Countries fund. It is important to empower youth to create projects that address environmental issues, and to include those who have direct experience with the impacts of climate change in the decision-making process.

Mohsin Ul Hakim, Special Correspondent, Jamuna TV

In the 3rd week of November, a youth named Manirul died from a snake bite at Dublar Char in Sundarban. Despite the fact that many people die from this particular snake every year, no one was able to identify the species.

It is important to consider why the affected population is unaware of the dangers posed by this snake. It is possible that youth from vulnerable areas are not being effectively connected through seminars and policy dialogue. This needs to be addressed, as efforts to address environmental issues will not be successful without the active engagement of local people.

Dr Abdun Nur Tushar, Physician and media personality, Gati Media and Vision Associates

We need to create environmentally conscious citizens, but this often leads to accusations of being anti-developmentalist. It is important to find alternative and effective ways to address climate change that do not rely on exploiting the environment for economic growth.

It is unfair for large companies to engage in sustainable projects after damaging the environment. This approach seems to be motivated more by a desire to make money than a genuine desire to save the planet. The current trend of growth-centric development, based on consumerism and a market economy, needs to be reevaluated in order to ensure the survival of humanity and the planet. We must change our perspective on these issues.

Saber Hossain Chowdhury MP, Chairman, Parliamentary Standing Committee on Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change

Climate change is a grave threat that requires urgent action from the 20 countries responsible for 80% of emissions. While adaptation and resilience are important, they have their limits. Reducing emissions is essential, as it will ultimately determine the extent to which we can adapt to the impacts of climate change.

It is important to be realistic in our expectations of young people. We should not burden them with impossible tasks, but rather work to fix as much as we can. It is unfair to ask youth to address the challenge of adaptation and resilience on their own, as they cannot solve the problem alone. We need to address the root causes of climate change and take collective action to address this crisis.

Mitigation is a key part of adaptation. It is important to motivate young people to contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 12 on Sustainable Production and Consumption. As change agents, they can make a significant impact by reducing their environmental footprint, promoting circular economy principles, and minimizing waste. Solidarity among young people around the world is essential for achieving real change in the fight against climate change.

If you look at Bangladesh, it may be doing extremely well in terms of GDP growth. However, when considering the cost of this progress in terms of environmental degradation, the equation does not seem sustainable. Bangladesh plays a strong role in international platforms like COP conferences, about climate change, but to what extent are we protecting our own environment? We can't have double standard there.

In addition to measuring the economic growth of Bangladesh through GDP, it is important to also quantify the loss and damage to the environment caused by the adverse impacts of climate change, including the increased frequency of natural disasters. This will provide a more accurate understanding of the country's overall development.

Tanjim Ferdous, In-charge, NGOs & Foreign Missions, The Daily Star

We are destroying Mother Nature in such a way that at some point, the damage will be irreversible. There will be no way to avoid facing the ultimate consequence.

Our efforts to decrease the use of single-use plastics are not sufficient. The uncontrolled rate of deforestation and destruction of other natural resources have been negatively affecting natural ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate.

The important discussion today is about creating climate resilience and the important role that youth play in this resilience creation. At first, those of us at the policy-making level need to listen to the youth, talk about the demands of the youth, and discuss their innovations and how they can move forward with them.

556,Ensuring the rights of small-scale fishers for the sustainable fisheries sector in Bangladesh,"Nazma Yesmin, Director, BILS

In our country, the ratio of the formal to informal sector is around 15% to 85%. The working patterns of fish workers are mostly informal, and despite the significant contribution of people working in the fishing sector to our national economy, their rights are often overlooked.

It is important to ensure the participation of all stakeholders to make the sector sustainable. There is a need to increase cooperation among stakeholders to improve the current situation of fishworkers and ensure their rights.

Although BILS began working on issues related to fishworkers in 2014, the organization has expanded its scope by working on various projects since then. Based on the knowledge and experience gained through working in the field level in the Sustainable Ocean project, we have developed a list of recommendations. We hope to work towards a sustainable fishing sector with the involvement of all stakeholders, including the government, owners, and fishworkers.

Rezoanul Haque Azom, Sr. Officer and Project Coordinator, BILS

The Sustainable Ocean project is funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and has the Danish Institute for Human Rights (DIHR) as an international partner. At the national level, the lead implementing organization is the Manusher Jonno Foundation (MJF). The local implementing partners, BILS and COAST Foundation, worked in the Patharghata sub-district of Barguna and the Moheshkhali sub-district of Cox's Bazar, respectively.

For this project, we conducted several studies, including a situation analysis of human rights in the fisheries industry, a study on the human rights situation in the shrimp industry, a legal and policy analysis of the fishing sector from a human rights perspective, a study on the industrial marine fisheries sector, and a survey on the availability of fishworkers cards.

The fisheries sector is unique due to its different labour patterns. Regular working hours and holidays do not typically apply to fishworkers, and the breaks between work periods are also different. For example, when a trawler begins its voyage to sea, fishworkers must work uninterrupted for 15 to 20 days.

During our assessment of various government legal and policy documents, we found different terms used to refer to these people. The lack of a distinctive definition creates confusion about which group should receive privileges when benefits are given by the government. Therefore, we recommend using the term ""fishworkers"" to define fishermen, women fisheries workers and other labour force associated with fishing so that all of them can benefit.

We conducted 2,000 interviews in the Patharghat and Moheshkhali areas as part of a situation analysis of human rights in the fishery sector. Some of the findings include the absence of written contracts, unfair wages, unsafe working conditions, no fixed working hours, fishing in dangerous conditions, child labour, lack of basic facilities such as housing and medical facilities, sexual harassment, and environmental degradation.

We also conducted a separate study on the human rights situation in the shrimp industry, which focused on three sources: factories, dipos (processing facilities), and shrimp enclosures. Generally, at the time of conducting that study, we found that 2 out of 3 workers did not have appointment letters. 72% of workers did not receive pay slips, and those who did receive them did not have working hours listed on them. Around 75% of factory workers tended to work overtime. 49% of workers claimed that they were not provided with personal protective equipment. According to 63% of workers, women did not receive equal pay for the same amount of work.

The findings of the study on the industrial marine fisheries sector in Bangladesh include an oversupply of industrial trawlers compared to fisheries resources, violations of laws, policies, and guidelines, illegal entry of vessels within Bangladesh's boundaries, lack of regular research continuation on fisheries resources, the destruction of small fisheries through illegal and unregulated fishing, and the negative impacts of climate change and pollution.

To analyse the legal and policy framework for the fisheries sector in Bangladesh, we assessed the activities of government organisations, the citizen charter, and all relevant laws, policies, and rules.

We recommend creating an accurate list of fishworkers under the supervision of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. This list should be updated at least every two years. Additional recommendations include providing financial assistance for daily expenses along with food aid during the fishing ban, and ensuring sustainable alternative employment for fishworkers on an urgent basis to address financial crises during the fishing ban.

Other recommendations based on the project include including fishworkers in labor laws, conducting regular research on fisheries' stock, biodiversity, and climate management and conservation, providing social security allowances and skill development to ensure alternative employment for fishworkers during fishing bans, regularly inspecting shrimp enclosures, and ensuring the safety of fishworkers who put their lives at risk.

Mizanur Rahman Bahadur, COAST Foundation Representative, Moheshkhali and Advisor, Cox's Bazaar Fishing Boat Workers' Union

During the fishing ban season, many fishworkers are unable to join alternative works due to their lack of skills beyond fishing. To meet basic needs, they often have to rely on loans, which can lead to a cycle of debt. This eventually decreases the quality of their living conditions. If we do not take initiatives now, we may face a shortage of fishworkers in the future.

Aid, such as rice, often only reaches a small number of fishworker families due to a lack of accountability among relevant authorities. The government should increase transparency in the distribution of aid by using digital platforms.

The lack of employment contracts makes it difficult to prove employment. Without documentation, the owner of the trawler may deny the presence of the deceased or missing person on the vessel. These issues must also be addressed. We hope that government and industry leaders will work to ensure the rights, safety, and security of these people and make the process of obtaining aid more accessible, considering their literacy levels.

S M Zakir Hossain, BILS Representative, Patharghata, and Social Welfare Secretary, Jatiya Sramik Federation

Many fishermen have drowned in the sea due to strong cyclones. When our fishermen are washed ashore in neighbouring countries, they are often mistreated by their coast guard and even imprisoned. In contrast, their fishermen are given food and shelter in our coastal areas. Additionally, there are some areas in the Sundarbans where trawlers are not allowed to take shelter, and if they do, they are heavily fined. In case of natural disasters, where will our fishermen go if our places impose fines upon us?

During the fishing ban, which lasts 207 days out of the year, fishermen are not allowed to fish. However, the government incentives provided to them are not sufficient. I recommend that at least 60 kg of rice and TK 5000 be given to fishermen during the ban period.

Naimul Ahsan Jewel, General Secretary, Jatiya Sramik Jote Bangladesh

A centre should be established near fish landing to collect information about fishworkers and create a database. This would also help us provide compensation to the families of lost fishworkers.

The government should provide SME loans to fishermen to ensure their sustainable livelihood. The government could also provide small loans to fishermen to start small businesses during the off-season.

Chowdhury Ashiqul Alam, General Secretary, Bangladesh Trade Union Shangha

The International Labour Organization (ILO) has adopted the Fishing Convention (C188) to improve the fisheries industry. However, Bangladesh has not yet ratified it. This convention covers both traditional and industrial fishing. There should be strong coordination among the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock Bangladesh, and the Ministry of Shipping to develop our fishing sector.

The employers often hide the fisheries IDs of workers to avoid responsibility in the event of an accident. It has also been noted that our neighboring fishing community has access to radar technology that helps them locate shoals of fish. This modern technology should be made available to our fishworkers as well.

Golam Mostafa Chowdhury, President, Barguna Jele Matshya Trawler Malik Samity

During the last cyclone, our fishworkers could not enter the Sundarbans to seek shelter due to legal restrictions and the fear of litigation, which cost many of their lives. These restrictions should be lifted during times of natural disasters.

Because our boats are made of wood and considered outdated, we cannot get loans from banks. Our trawlers also do not have insurance, which traps our fishermen in debt for years.

Rezaul Karim, General Secretary, Matshya Byboshayi Samity, Fisheries Ghat, Cox's Bazar

We have a friendly relationship with the fishworkers, and we are aware of their challenging living conditions at sea. They do not have access to weather forecasts. Researcher should speak directly with these fishworkers during the off-season when they are at home to learn about the challenges they face and their actual conditions while at sea.

Md. Shakil Akhter Chowdhury, General Secretary, Bangladesh Labour Federation

Fishworkers make up 12% of our total workforce and around two crore people depend on this profession for their livelihood. Fisheries contribute 3.5% of our GDP, so we cannot ignore them any longer.

The challenges faced by fishermen are significant. They do not have a minimum wage, and there is no framework for determining their vacation, holidays, and work breaks. Their health and safety should be ensured in case of accidents or other difficulties.

Bangladesh has ratified ILO Convention 138 to end child labour, but our fishing sector continues to rely on child labour to some extent, and this problem is growing.

The quality of life for fishworkers has been declining for years due to the debt trap. Our country cannot become a middle-income country without addressing the needs of these disadvantaged people.

Mostaq Ahmed, Organising Secretary, Boat Malik Samity, Cox's Bazar

To ensure the food security of the entire nation, we must protect the lives and rights of our fishworkers.

Previously, it cost 50,000 Taka to send a boat to sea, but now it requires 300,000 Taka due to rising costs of goods and oil. We have to pay around 4,000 Taka per fishworker without any guarantee that they will catch fish.

Industrial fishing boats are highly efficient at catching all types of fish due to their advanced radar systems for locating fish. However, they only keep the high-quality fish and discard the rest, which is destructive and needs to be restricted.

Quamrul Ahsan, President, Jatiya Sramik Federation

First of all, we need to establish criteria for defining a fishworker. The relevant government departments have a role to play in this regard. These people do not receive any documentation when they go to sea for fishing and do not have any place to rest. Compensation should be provided to them for unfortunate events such as death or disappearance.

We have been advocating for a national minimum wage of 20,000 Taka, which if implemented will be applied for fisheries sector as well.

The labor law should be amended to include fishworkers and they should be granted the right to form trade unions. It is necessary to create an updated database of fishworkers so that they can access benefits provided by the government.

Md Ataur Rahman Khan, Chief Scientific Officer (Planning and Survey), Department of Fisheries, Government of Bangladesh

I must confess that while we work for the benefit of fishermen and the fisheries industry, we have not properly defined fishworkers. As the focal person in the reform process, I will include today's points in the discussion with my Director General and recommend them for the next amendment of the fisheries policy.

Additionally, we are collaborating with various stakeholders to gather more information about the sector. The Department of Fisheries has started to support fishermen by issuing identity cards. So far, we have registered 17,37,786 fishermen across the country and provided identity cards to 14,20,000 individuals. Fishermen are provided with certain benefits through the government's social safety net programs, such as identity cards to access support during the off-season. Distributing identity cards is a top priority in the coastal region.

We have granted 400 crore Taka to provide micro credit, matching funds, and training to 450 fishermen's villages in 45 Upazilas. We also provide 86 kg of rice to card-holding fishermen. While I acknowledge that this amount of rice is not sufficient for them, the government can provide additional cash assistance during this period.

It is worth noting that while our fishermen are banned from fishing, fishermen from surrounding countries fish in our coastal waters. We must ensure that the fishing ban period is announced simultaneously in our neighbouring coastal areas. These issues need to be addressed through diplomatic channels.

It would be beneficial if fishermen could be included in insurance policies. After registering boats, we will provide a device to every vessel that will allow us to locate fishermen and gather their information.

Anwar Hossain, President, Bangladesh Jatiyatibadi Sramik Dal and Chair of the Session

Sitakunda was once a prosperous area for fishing, but many species are now threatened with extinction due to the negative impact of the Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard. While distributing relief to fishermen who lived near the coast and were severely affected by the cyclone of 1991, I had the opportunity to witness the poor living conditions of the fishing community.

Millions of people rely on this sector for their livelihood, so it is important to listen to their voices at the grassroots level. It is crucial to bring the true conditions of their lives to the attention of the relevant authorities in order to ensure that their rights are protected.

Refayet Ullah Mirdha, Senior Staff Reporter of The Daily Star & Moderator of the session

I believe the fishing sector can follow the example of the garment industry in terms of success through increased exports. The garment industry has had to focus on compliance in order to maintain its international markets.

Similarly, the owners of the fishing sector should consider exploring international markets for exports as a way to formalize the sector. This approach will enable them to receive more support from the government and improve the situation of fishworkers by ensuring compliance. Over time, this will help the sector to become formalised.

557,Biofortified crops: Connecting value chain actors and policymakers in Bangladesh,"HarvestPlus - Bangladesh Initiative to Enhance Nutrition Security and Governance (BIeNGS) Project organized a roundtable titled ""Biofortified crops: Connecting value chain actors and policymakers in Bangladesh"" on November 13, 2022. HarvestPlus is part of the CGIAR and is based at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), a CGIAR research center. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Md Khairul Bashar, PhD, Country Manager, HarvestPlus Bangladesh

Bangladesh have self-sufficiency in food security, but nutrition deficiency is still high. About 28 per cent of children aged under 5 in the country do not get enough zinc in their diets. The farm families cannot afford nutritionally diverse diets and not easily reached by food fortification or supplementation initiatives. Biofortification has been proven to be a strong alternative in the combat of hidden hunger all over the world. Biofortification is the process of increasing the density of micronutrients in staple crops through conventional breeding techniques, agronomic practices, or genetic modification.

HarvestPlus-Bangladesh strategized its delivery from crop development to popularizing among farm community and scaling up production and commercialization including policy advocacy and communication. Up to 2021, through support from HarvestPlus program, ten zinc rice, one wheat and three pulse varieties were released by BRRI, BSMRAU, BINA, BWMRI and BARI subsequently in Bangladesh. About 3.1 million HH reached directly with biofortified crops' seed and 18,000 MT zinc rice aggregated & milled for the consumers.

To boost and root biofortified crop mainstreaming of biofortification is needed in crop development, seed multiplication and extension through public and private sectors. Inclusion of biofortified rice in social safety net programs will also create another market for this specialized crop.

MA Saleque, PhD, Deputy Country Manager, HarvestPlus Bangladesh

The 54-month long BleNGS Project co-funded by the European Union started on September 1, 2018 in three upazilas of each Jamalpur and Sherpur districts in partnership with World Vision Bangladesh, Unnayan Sangha and the Institute of Development Studies (IDS). Around 6,240 demonstration plots of biofortified crops were established with other awareness raising events by the project. Focusing of nutrition governance all departments are aware now about biofortified zinc rice in the region. The local Government and private sector have taken up it for commercialization. Project's Local advocacy meetings recommendations are required more investment in the extension, start up support in new areas and availability of seed in local markets.

Md Harun or Rashid, a consumer in Islampur Upazila of Jamalpur

HarvestPlus has helped me by giving seeds of zinc rice varieties like BRRI dhan72, Bangabandhu dhan100, and BRRI dhan62. I started with BRRI dhan72 the crops are yielded better than previous crops. Our children not getting sick and have healthy mental & physical growth owing to zinc rice.

Md Kadem Ali, a farmer in Jamalpur Sadar Upazila

Last year, HarvestPlus gave us seeds of BRRI dhan74 to grow crops. We got good yield. We also kept the seeds of BRRI dhan74 and distributed in our areas.

Mostafa Faruque Al Banna, Associate Research Director- FPMU (Food Planning and Monitoring Unit), Ministry of Food

If we want to ensure nutrition-sensitive social protection, then the inclusion of biofortified zinc rice in social safety net programs is very important. It is important to identify such pocket areas where zinc deficiency is high to include biofortified zinc rice of those areas' social safety net programs.

Dr Mary Rashid, Team Leader, BIeNGS project, World Vision

We need to design a comprehensive initiative that includes nutrition-specific components to bring better nutrition outcomes. It requires organizational design and appropriate capacity building of all entities. We are working with the government and relevant departments so that our learnings can be mainstreamed through the core national programs.

Dr Rudaba Khondker, Country Director, The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)

Govt has enacted a number of good policies. Now those policies need to be implemented by the Govt Institute/ Departments for mainstreaming. The leadership should come from the government so that we can track the progress of the biofortification initiatives properly. Currently, we are working with HarvestPlus on the commercialization of biofortified rice and we need to work more closely in future.

Saiqa Siraj, Country Director, Nutrition International (NI)

Biofortification is already in the national policies and international commitment of Bangladesh. As the food price is high and there is an overall crisis in the global economy, the dependency on rice in Bangladesh will increase in the next two years. Therefore, this is high time we took coordinated actions and reached the most vulnerable population with biofortified rice.

Md Shahjahan Kabir, PhD, Director General, Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI)

BRRI developed biofortified zinc rice varieties are cultivating in favorable work environment. BRRI currently working to developed stress tolerant biofortified rice variety and also have plan to mainstream the biofortification in the future breeding program.

Md Benojir Alam, Director General, Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE)

Biofortified zinc rice is vital for us as our people do not get a sufficient amount of nutritious food. Biofortified zinc rice is now being cultivated in both the Aman and Boro season. So, we need to increase the demonstration of zinc biofortified rice for people who are suffering from a lack of nutritious foods.

Margherita Capalbi, Programme Manager, Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition, Delegation of the European Union in Bangladesh

According to National Nutrition Service findings, micro-nutritional deficiency is prevalent among children under five and women. The European Union (EU) is committed to support Bangladesh in achieving SDG-2 (zero hunger). The EU is supporting the country with the food and nutrition program to promote nutrition and reduce all forms of malnutrition with special attention to adolescent girls, children and women.

Md Sayedul Islam, Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture

We have to ensure food security as well as nutrition security in our country. We are almost sufficient in food and rice, but hidden hunger prevails. We are concerned about the poorest section of the country who are suffering from micro-nutritional deficiency and their staple food is rice. So, biofortification is an excellent idea to minimize the problem. Our ministry and research organizations are closely working on it. We have high yielding rice varieties for Boro season but now we need to focus on the Aman and Aus seasons. Zinc biofortified rice varieties have to be high yielding, otherwise farmers would not be interested in cultivating them. The food ministry can play a very important role in procuring biofortified rice varieties.

Shaikh Mohammad Bokhtiar, PhD, Executive Chairman, Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC)

Dr Howarth Bouis, who discovered the idea of biofortification, highlighted three Ds (discovery, development, and dissemination) to make the biofortification initiative successful. Although rice is the country's staple food, we need to think about the biofortification of some other staple crops.

558,Understanding adolescent pregnancy in Bangladesh,"RedOrange, in association with The Daily Star, organised a roundtable to launch a study report titled “My mother-in-law forbade me to take pills” - Factors Driving Adolescent Pregnancies Among Young Women in Clients from Health Clinics in Bangladesh on November 8, 2022. The study was conducted as part of the Resilience through Information on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights & Empowerment (RISE) programme. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Arnob Chakrabarty, Managing Director, RedOrange Media and Communications

During the liberation war, people living in refugee camps didn't receive any sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services. Even 50 years after independence, many people living in fragile settings such as refugee camps, coastal areas, slums and char areas of the country still don't have access to SRHR services. We undertook this RISE training programmeto address this gap. Today, we will share the findings of our research study, and discuss what should be done to provide SRHR services to these vulnerable communities.

The research report will be shared with all the relevant stakeholders and will also be available on Share-Net Bangladesh.

Fragility is a critical issue that needs to be discussed further because there is a difference between providing SRHR services to all and providing SRHR services to people who live in fragile settings. We need to discuss further how we will define a fragile setting. We also need to find out to what extent the government can add the issue of SRHR in fragile settings to existing government strategies targeting adolescents so that specific actions can be taken to support these vulnerable groups.

Umayer Abu Omar, Project Coordinator, RedOrange Media and Communications (RISE Project)

The RISE project is an Orange Knowledge Programme Tailor-Made Training course that started in May 2021 and will continue till December 2022. The Orange Knowledge Programme is funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and managed by Nuffic, a Dutch non-profit organisation for internationalisation in education.

The main objective of the project is to improve the SRHR knowledge of NGO workers in Bangladesh, especially those who work in fragile settings. The project considers the coastal belts of Bangladesh where climate-affected populations live, and areas with Rohingya refugees and host communities as fragile settings.

KTI Royal Tropical Institute, Simavi and RedOrange Media and Communications are the three consortium partners in this project. The project also has two beneficiary partners -- Family Planning Association of Bangladesh (FPAB) and Integrated Social Development Effort (ISDE) -- who are disseminating SRHR knowledge all over the country.

The RISE project has five modules that work as five pillars of the project. Initially, 30 NGO staff including six staff from the NGO Dalit were trained on the first and second modules--basic comprehensive SRHR and SRHR in fragile settings. We chose eight participants from the initial 30 trainees as master trainers. They were then provided ToT (Training of Trainers) training under module three and engaged in providing training on the first and second modules to their colleagues in their respective organisations, and, thus, 50 field levels across the country were empowered with the RISE knowledge. The unique aspect of RISE is that it covers human rights issues including the rights of the LGBTQ community.

After completion of their training on the first three modules, the master trainers are engaged in research as part of modules four and five. They learned about conducting qualitative action research and how to do evidence-based advocacy based on their research findings. The master trainers conducted research in five geographic areas in Bangladesh.

Ophelia Chatterjee, Advisor - SRHR , KIT Royal Tropical Institute

The main goal of this project is to increase the technical capacity of the NGOs and health professionals who work on SRHR issues in fragile settings, specifically from a rights-based and gender-transformative perspective. It also explores the link between climate change and SRHR.

We have incorporated the Training of Trainers (ToT) element to make the project sustainable as part of the second project outcome, which is to improve the capacity of NGO professionals to deliver training to their colleagues. The master trainers are continuing to provide this training programme in their organisation to share knowledge with their colleagues.

The third outcome is to increase the use of evidence-informed approaches in programme advocacy and knowledge translation on SRHR issues, through conducting a research study and developing knowledge products. We have partnered with Dhaka University and Daffodil International University to improve the exchange of training materials between educational institutes and NGOs.

As part of the research project, we held priority-setting sessions, and adolescent pregnancy emerged as the topic of most relevance and interest to the trainers. We conducted a study on this topic in five areas of Bangladesh. We also conducted training sessions and workshops on basic principles of research, research methods, research analysis, knowledge translation and research advocacy.

Professor Dr. Mohammad Bellal Hossain, Department of Population Sciences, University of Dhaka

The study population consisted of adolescent girls aged 13-19 years living in the selected study areas, who were currently pregnant or had delivered a baby in the past six months. Our main objective was to understand issues related to adolescent pregnancy. The study was conducted in five geographical locations -- Cox's Bazaar, Chattogram, Dhaka, Cumilla and Barisal.

The study found that adolescent pregnancy is quite common among married adolescent girls, and child marriage is the primary reason behind its high prevalence. Other reasons include the improper use of contraceptives and lack of access to SRHR information and services before and immediately after marriage. There is a massive pressure on married adolescent girls to conceive shortly after marriage. Adolescent girls are also not in a position to negotiate due to their lack of agency. Insecurity about infertility and wrong perceptions about hormonal contraceptives also contribute to the high rate of adolescent pregnancy in Bangladesh.

It is also found that unmarried young women lack access to family planning services. Their knowledge about contraception is also poor. They know about pills and condoms but are not aware of long-term methods. Health service providers also harbour stigma around providing SRHR services to unmarried young people.

The study identified major consequences of adolescent pregnancies that include physical and mental health problems, parenting pressure and economic strain. The study also found that women's reproductive autonomy generally improves after the birth of their first child. It also improves their access to SRHR services. However, for unmarried adolescent girls, the situation is different. They suffer more because of social shame and stigma. In many cases, pregnancy leads to early marriage and the pressure to abort.

The study offers several important recommendations, including strengthening women's agency and increasing their participation in pregnancy-related decision-making; making family members, teachers, health workers and religious leaders aware of the importance of sex education and involving them in the process; increasing the use of social media and telemedicine to provide SRHR knowledge and services.

Anke van der Kwaak, Team Leader, SRHR, KIT and moderator of the session

Although the study started off focusing on how climate change would make people more vulnerable, the issue received less priority in the course of the study. We should focus more on the linkage between fragility and climate change since gender-based violence and poverty are increasing due to climate change. In the report, we talked more about fragility in rural settings and didn't pay adequate attention to the vulnerabilities in urban slums.

We need to discuss how we can address the interlink between fragilities caused by climate change and the lack of access to SRHR services, and how we can engage men in SRHR programmes more effectively.

Dewan Tanvir Ahmed, RISE Master Trainer & Program Officer (Knowledge Management Center), FPAB

Men need to be empowered with adequate knowledge of SRHR to engage them in pregnancy-related decision-making processes. Our study found that they are reluctant to know about family planning services and generally pass the decision-making authority to their mother.

Mushfiqua Zaman Satiar, Senior Policy Advisor, SRHR and Gender, Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands

Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MOWCA) runs adolescent clubs where adolescent girls can learn about pregnancy, contraceptives, child caring, etc. However, there is no such facility for married girls. So, while visiting houses, health workers and family welfare assistants can hold joint meetings such as uthan boithok (courtyard meeting) with family members, especially husbands and mothers-in-law. We have done this in our ASTHA project, which helped men understand their responsibilities regarding family planning.

The government has adopted the GEMS (Gender Equity Movement in Schools) curriculum, and it will be implemented in all government schools. Therefore, we need to do advocacy with the Ministry of Education to bring back the SRHR issues in this curriculum.

The study findings must be shared with all the relevant ministries and development partners.

Dr Md Ikhtiar Uddin Khandaker, Director, Health Programme, Care Bangladesh

The effort of building agency among adolescent girls should be started in the early stages, particularly when they are in school. They need to have adequate access to SRHR information.

Frontline health workers and multi-purpose health volunteers can be the first contact for young couples' counselling. Besides contraceptives, they should advise them about long-term family planning. Some organisations provide newlywed kits, which can be helpful to increase the agency of new couples. Parents also need to be engaged in this process.

We all know about our national adolescent health strategy, which is the policy document for our country. Addressing adolescent vulnerabilities is a key strategic area of the policy. It also covers how they will be protected during disasters. There is a lack of data on how the climate crisis negatively impacts adolescent well-being. I believe this study will help to address this gap. There is also an opportunity to incorporate the learnings of the study with the national strategy. However, a broader study, covering a larger population and area and combining both quantitative and qualitative data, is required.

Dr Noor Mohammad, Executive Director, PSTC

The study should have followed a mixed method combining qualitative and quantitative research methodologies.

The study findings need to be shared with concerned ministries and other relevant stakeholders.

Professor Dr. Abu Naser Zafar Ullah, Dean & Professor, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Daffodil International University

The involvement of men in family planning campaigns is not new in Bangladesh. We need to look at the issue from a different perspective to make their involvement more effective.

Bangladesh has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world. Lack of education, social and economic vulnerability, low status of women and poor support from the social system are driving the early marriage in Bangladesh. There are several platforms and campaigns to make people aware of the SRHR issues. We need to scale up the coverage of these interventions.

Different climate change impacts cause different types of fragilities, and that need to be considered while formulating our plans and policies.

Dr. Nazneen I.Khan, Researcher, (Lead, Gender, and Climate Change) ICCCAD

We need to look beyond male-female gender binaries and consider the vulnerabilities of persons with other gender identities.

Dr Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), is closely involved with the formulation of the 9th Five-Year Plan. There will be a separate chapter on SRHR and gender in this new plan.

Religious leaders can play a significant role in disseminating SRHR related information.

Professor Dr Mohammad Mainul Islam, Department of Population Sciences, University of Dhaka

Climate change is a major concern for us. Climate-change-induced displaced people in Bangladesh are facing severe challenges in terms of getting access to SRHR services. We need to consider the impact of climate change on reproductive health and conduct more research in this area. We also need to talk about how we can ensure the reproductive health rights of both men and women during climate disasters.

We have to address poverty in targeted areas. More emphasis should be given to female education and comprehensive sexuality education. We also need to address existing gender imbalances and social values and norms that make adolescent girls more vulnerable.

Masuma Billah, Programme Head, Gender Justice and Diversity, BRAC

The study shows that mothers-in-law exercise authority over the decision of their daughters-in-law's pregnancy. Therefore, we should work with them and make them understand the risks of adolescent pregnancy and other SRHR issues.

Rowshon Akhter Urmee, Project Coordinator, RHRN-2, Social Empowerment & Legal Protection Programme, BRAC

SRHR issue is taboo in our society. It has been included in the education curriculum, but teachers are hesitant to talk about it in the classroom. We have formed a youth group that does advocacy with teachers in community schools, and, as a result, teachers are now more comfortable with these issues. Students also now talk comfortably about their SRHR needs and take services from health centres. We need to create an enabling environment by engaging young people in the communities. The local administration and school management committees also need to be engaged more in the process.

Tanjim Ferdous, In-Charge, NGOs & Foreign Missions, Business Development Team, The Daily Star

We need to think about how to make projects like RISE sustainable since it takes time to bring change to policies and behaviours. An enterprise model can be a possible solution.

We need to increase the use of social media to disseminate SRHR information to younger generations.

The government has taken various measures for climate adaptation and resilience. SRHR issues must be considered as a key component of these interventions.

Dilruba Nasrin, Programme Manager, BRAC

There should be strong coordination between the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Directorate General of Family Planning (DGFP).

Although MOWCA has different platforms, such as adolescent girls' clubs across the country where issues like child marriage and violence against women are discussed, adolescent pregnancy and SRHR issues are not addressed on these platforms. We need to make proper use of these platforms for the dissemination of SRHR messages.

559,Violence against female sex workers in Dhaka city,"Sex Workers Network (SWN) organized a research findings dissemination session titled ""Qualitative study on violence among the female sex workers in Dhaka City, Bangladesh"" on September 22, 2022. The study was funded by CREA, an international feminist human rights organization. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Furkan Hossain, Chairman and CEO, Research and Management Consultants Ltd.

The Sex Workers Network (SWN) is leading the coalition of 29 community-based organisations of sex workers and, therefore, it is well-acquainted with the real scenario of violence experienced by sex workers.

SWN recently conducted a qualitative study titled 'Violence among the Female Sex Workers in Dhaka City'. The purpose of the study was to understand various forms of violence that female sex workers experience in Dhaka City. The study also identified ways to prevent these violence and exploitation.

Two types of data sources were used for the research -- primary and secondary sources. As primary sources, we took in-depth interviews of 40 female sex workers (FSWs) and conducted eight Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) with 49 female sex workers. The study team also did 15 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) to collect information about policy, key interventions and recommendations.

Previous study reports such as Mapping study and size estimation of key populations in Bangladesh for HIV programs 2016, National AIDS/STD Control Programme (NASP), Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance (IBBS) 2020, AIDS/STD Programme (ASP) were used as secondary sources.

In 2016, the National AIDS/STD Control Program (NASP) divided female sex workers into several categories such as street-based, hotel-based and residence-based. The study team has tried to find out whether these categories have changed over time.

From August 15 to September 5, 2022 the study team collected data in Dhaka North City Corporation and Dhaka South City Corporation. They focused on three categories of female sex workers: Street based Female Sex Workers (SBFSW), Hotel based Female Sex Workers (HBFSW) and Residence based Female Sex Workers (RBFSW). The study findings reveal that the settings/catagories of sex workers have changed significantly. Now, a FSW works in multiple settings in the city.

Among the 40 female sex workers, 31 received some sort of schooling, formal or informal, and 29 are below or 30 years of age. The study finds that most of the participants live in rented house. They generally live with their husbands or alone. 37 FSWs had their first sex under 17 years of age, and 55 percent of the study participants had their first sex against their will. 10 participants are now involved in various occupations such as housemaid and garments worker, besides being sex workers. 77 percent FSWs earn more than 15,000 Tk per month from sex work. However, 31 study participants shared that they were forced to give a share from their earnings to dalals (pimps), members of law enforcement agencies and babus.

The study further reveals that 19 FSWs went outside Dhaka to have sex with their clients within the last 12 months. Most of them went to Cox's Bazar with their clients.

Among the 40 participants, 27 became pregnant at least once and 17 of them at or under 17 years of age. 26 participants had abortions/MR and 76 percent of them had abortion/MR on their own will.

55 percent of the study participants use smartphones, and among them, 95.5 percent use imo and 52.6 percent use Facebook. They face various types of online harassments by the clients such as blackmailing and threat of sharing of images and video online.

The study reveals that all the participants faced violence while working outdoors; indoor workspaces were also not safe for most of them. The most common forms of violence they face are being beaten up by clients, threat of physical violence and rape attempt. Some of them were also raped by their clients.

The dilemma regarding sex work as a profession prevailed among sex workers and key informants due to legal barriers. Some of them regret being sex workers as society doesn't accept them or their children. Schools don't allow their children to study, and therefore, the children go astray; boys become drug peddler or engage in petty crimes, and girls often choose their mothers' profession. FSWs struggle to find suitable housing and they have to pay high rent. They suffered greatly during COVID-19 due to the lack of savings, food and clients. They had to borrow money with high interest rates. They also faced police violence during the pandemic. Sex workers are in total darkness about the laws that can safeguard them. They also believe that the government wouldn't be able to bring the issue of their rights into a legal framework in Bangladesh.

The doctors and male pharmacists, according to the female sex workers, don't treat them well. However, they get better treatments from the NGOs. 37 out of the 40 female sex workers received COVID-19 vaccines.

The study made the following recommendations:

Engage and organise female sex workers so that they can demand their rights

Establish a dedicated helpline for sex workers so that they can report violence and seek support.

Establish day care center or shelter home for sex workers' children

Sensitize government officials about the rights of sex workers as human beings

Provide internet safety orientation to sex workers

Develop an advocacy framework for preventing violence against female sex workers and improving their health and social well-being.

Mobilize resources for supporting the sex workers network and its member organizations

Conduct more research on the problems faced by sex workers

Aroma Dutta, Member of Parliament and Member, Parliamentary Standing Committee on Social Welfare

Understanding the life of sex workers in Bangladesh is not easy. They lead a vulnerable life and face a lot of challenges such as harassment, violence and denial of basic rights. The study has done a recommendable job in finding out the problems faced by female sex workers in Dhaka city. However, the study has mentioned nothing about the class dynamics of FSWs which has a significant impact on their life.

We need to ensure that all the sex workers get benefits of the social safety net programmes as a citizen of Bangladesh. They must be provided with NID cards. They should also be provided with technical training so that they can become entrepreneurs and find alternative livelihoods.

The SWN should identify the loopholes in the implementation of the laws regarding the protection and welfare of sex workers in Bangladesh.

Dr. Lima Rahman, Director, Health, Nutrition & HIV/AIDS Sector, Save the Children

We don't have much data regarding stigma, violence, and discrimination against sex workers. Although this research is not a national-level study, several of the indexes from this study are very useful. I would request data triangulation such as finding out the changing patterns of violence among sex workers and the reasons behind young married women coming to this profession. These additional data will help us choose a right direction and design our programs better.

Aleya Akhter Lily, President, Sex Workers Network

The study tried to understand the nature and magnitude of violence against female sex workers in Dhaka city. It also tried to find out some effective solutions to this problem. We are presenting the findings of the study to experts and activists to get their feedback and formulate an action plan to combat violence against female sex workers. We are seeking support from all of you since the Sex Workers Network would not be able to bring the change alone. We will enhance our engagement with all the relevant stakeholders, including decision-makers, concerned ministries, and donor organizations to carry forward the cause.

Dr. Rawnak Jahan, National Consultant, UNAIDS

Due to the lack of representation from sex workers in today's programme, we have missed the opportunity to know about their observation and demands. Although we have gained some significant insights, a larger sample size would have been preferable.

Sex workers typically lack savings, and they don't get support from the social safety net programmes. Many sex workers become dalal in order to subsist after retiring from their profession. Thus, it is crucially important to engage in advocacy with the relevant agencies to ensure social protection supports for the vulnerable elderly female sex workers.

Abdullah Al Hasan, Technical Coordinator, Advocacy & Capacity Building, CARE Bangladesh

The study followed the four settings mentioned in the National AIDS/STD Control Programme (NASP), 2016. However, the study should have included two more settings -- spa or massage centres and dance bars. The study only mentioned physical violence; we need to look at the psychological aspects of violence as well.

The government has taken a few good initiatives such as establishing one-stop crisis centres, shelter homes and a hotline number to combat violence against women. I don't think any special helpline for sex workers is required at this moment.

Jahanara Khatun, Assistant Program Manager, Naripokkho

The Sex Workers Network should have shared the findings with its affiliated organizations before public dissemination. It is important to inform sex workers about the study's findings because it is about the challenges they experience in their everyday lives. I always want them to lead the solution.

Instead of establishing new hotline numbers or services we should focus on increasing the efficiency of the existing one-stop crisis centres and help lines.

Nurun Nahar Begum, Sr. Program Officer, ActionAid

Sex workers are not aware of their fundamental rights. They also face various challenges due to the lack of formal recognition of their profession and the hostile attitude of the law enforcement agencies. Without protecting their fundamental rights, it is impossible to bring changes in the lives of sex workers. As citizens of this country, they must enjoy the rights guaranteed by the constitution. They should exercise their right to bargain collectively.

Md. Abdus Sobhan, Technical Specialist, Save the Children

We always ask sex workers about their problems not the solutions they want. Future studies on sex workers can consider this neglected aspect. I would like to request the Sex Workers Network to discuss the findings of this study with policy makers and inform them about the problems female sex workers face in their everyday lives.

Babul Kumar Adhikary, General Secretary, STI/AIDS Network of Bangladesh

In most cases, sex workers are not aware of the legal concepts of violence and harassment. It is the responsibility of the Sex Workers Network to educate and make them aware of these issues. The Network should also work for reaching the findings of the study to the policy makers.

Joya Sarker, President, SomporkerNoyaSetu

Generally, we collect data to understand a problem. However, in this study, the problem is apparently absent. The study, for example, could have covered issues related to the reproductive health of female sex workers or the risk of HIV infection among female sex workers due to violence by clients.

I strongly feel that representatives from sex workers should have been invited to today's programme. They could have identified missing points and errors in the study better than us.

MD. Hafizuddin Munna, General Secretary, PLHIV Network (PN+)

In Bangladesh, a sizable portion of the sex workers are HIV positive. Sex workers and drug users are considered potentially risky groups in the government's HIV program because of the connection between HIV, sex, and drug use. The use of drugs is widespread among sex workers. Information about HIV-positive sex workers and risky sexual behaviour among clients could have been included in the study.

Shahdat Hossain, Member, Network of People Who Use Drugs (NPUD)

Building awareness is essential for combating violence against sex workers. Creating a separate helpline for sex workers can be an option since they are unwilling to seek help from the law enforcement agencies. The platform can also help build a strong collaboration between the government and the organizations who work for the sex workers.

Rabiullah Islam, Program & Resource Officer, SEHD

We published a study report in 2018 on the conditions of floating and brothel-based sex workers. I believe, we need to reach the voice of sex workers to the policy level to prevent violence against them. Sex Workers Network can play a big role in establishing communications between sex workers and relevant government bodies such as the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Department of Social Service.

Rajkumary, Volunteer, Oboyob

The study has produced a lot of data but lacks an intersectional approach. It, for example, doesn't give us a clear picture of the relation between violence and earning. It's not like that a sex worker can avoid paying to a dalal if she gives money to the police. They are often forced to share their earnings with dalals, members of law enforcement agencies and babus.

Ivan Ahmed Katha, President, Shacheton Shamajsheba Hijra Shanga

Sex workers generally have reservations about disclosing personal information. Therefore, this study holds critical importance since it analysed the experience of 40 female sex workers in Dhaka. If the recommendations of the study are implemented properly it will bring positive changes to the life of sex workers in Bangladesh.

MD. Niaz Morshed Khan, Sr. Research Investigator, icddr,b

The study followed a mixed methodology by combining both qualitative and quantitative data. Therefore, we must exercise caution in analyzing the findings of the study. While disseminating the study findings, it must be mentioned that the study selected a small sample size purposefully and the aim of the study was not to make a generalization. I am not sure whether the study got approval from any ethical board. If not, then, that should be mentioned in the limitation section of the study.",2022-10-19 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/round-tables/news/violence-against-female-sex-workers-dhaka-city-3147246,2023-05-18 10:30:19,thedailystar
560,SDGs and Youth in Bangladesh,"Present Perspectives and Future Outlook

The Citizen's Platform for SDGs Bangladesh in partnership with UNDP-UNEP Poverty-Environment Action organised a day-long conference titled ""SDGs and Youth in Bangladesh: Present Perspectives and Future Outlook"" on September 1, 2022. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

INAUGURAL SESSION

Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya, Convenor, Citizen's Platform and Distinguished Fellow, CPD

Currently, one-third of our population belongs to the youth category, and more than half of the youth population are women. The future of Bangladesh belongs to the youth of Bangladesh. However, not every young person is equally privileged. Many of them are underprivileged and lack means to access opportunities. We need to reach them.

Moreover, many of our young people are not in employment, education and training (NEET), and the majority of them are women. These young people suffer from alienation which leads to various negative consequences such as drug addiction, mental stress, suicide and extremism.

Last but not least, we need to ensure that the voices of our young people are heard both nationally and internationally. We must ensure that every one of them is able to exercise their political right through participation in the democratic process/election.

A.K.M Fahim Mashroor, Co-founder & Chief Executive Officer, Bdjobs.com Limited

Globally, the rate of educated unemployment is the highest in Bangladesh. Around 25 lakh young people enter the job market every year but almost 50 percent remain unemployed. This is the root cause of all the social ills. Again, although the biggest employment source in the country is the informal SME sector, our education system is geared to cater to the formal sector only. A mindset has developed over the last few years where everyone wants to join the privileged and secure government sector, and that's why we are failing to explore the bigger opportunities. We need to change this mindset.

Nobonita Chowdhury, Director, Gender, Justice and Diversity Preventing Violence Against Women Initiative, BRAC

Bangladesh is going through a rapid transformation, and a growing number of Bangladeshi women are occupying important positions in both the public and private sectors. We need to carry forward this progress and ensure gender equality in every sphere of life. Men should play an important role in achieving gender equality as men too suffer from rigid gender norms.

Only 40 percent of women in Bangladesh have entered the workforce and 90 percent of them are working in the informal sector. So, it can be assumed that most of the educated women in Bangladesh are still out of the workforce. We need to seriously look into this gap.

Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, Eminent Filmmaker and Producer

Our educational system has been structured to produce manpower who solely aspire to work in the government sector. In the universities, the youngsters' mindset is programmed in such a way that they look down upon odd jobs. We need to change our outlook towards work to get rid of the burden of educated unemployment.

Again, whether it is the RMG or remittance sector, we still rely heavily on unskilled labour. It is high time our policymakers gave serious thought to imparting skills to our young people and building a skilled nation that can meet domestic demand and promote skilled migration.

Stefan Liller, Resident Representative, UNDP Bangladesh

Despite its tremendous economic progress, Bangladesh still needs to work and create space for youth empowerment. This is explained by the fact that the country ranks 126th out of 181 countries on the global youth index.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2022-2026 for Bangladesh has identified youth as a critical catalyst for transformational change. The UNDP country programme for 2022-2026 also emphasized the need for providing young people with the necessary skills and opportunities to help them reach their potential as one of the important economic agents in achieving national development aspirations. Thus, the development of youth remains our key priority.

The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been higher for marginalised and disadvantaged youths. All stakeholders must be involved to help these youths overcome the adverse consequences of the pandemic on education, employment, mental health, and the digital divide.

The road ahead is challenging but we have our guidelines in the 2030 Agenda and its 17 SDGs. As a long-standing development partner of Bangladesh, UNDP remains committed to staying engaged with young people to harness their potential as agents of positive change that will meaningfully contribute to the country's development.

M A Mannan MP, Honourable Minister, Ministry of Planning, Government of Bangladesh

Though the government is a key stakeholder in achieving the SDGs, it requires support from non-government stakeholders and citizen platforms. I welcome the effort of the Citizen's Platform for SDGs Bangladesh to engage young people in the implementation of SDGs.

There is negligence towards rural people in Bangladesh. Their demand is different from what people in urban areas want. They want ration cards, tube-wells, and hygienic toilets etc. To them, good governance may not a priority. We need to listen to the rural people and take action accordingly. If we fail to address their problems and mainstream their demands, we will not be able to achieve sustainable development.

Sultana Kamal, Former Advisor, Caretaker Government of Bangladesh & Core Group Member, Citizen's Platform for SDGs Bangladesh

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development pledge is not to leave anyone or group behind from the development process. Youth are the most energetic, creative, and courageous section of society, and that's why they will lead us in our collective journey. The creative force of young people must be channeled in the right direction to bring positive changes to our society. In our Proclamation of Independence, it was pledged that equality, social justice and dignity will be ensured for the people of Bangladesh. We should uphold that spirit and work for the country.

SESSION 1: POVERTY AND SOCIAL PROTECTION

Fakrul Ahsan, Chief Technical Advisor, UNDP Bangladesh

Targeting and ensuring the efficacy/quality of social protection programmes is a big challenge. Over the years, the budget for social protection has increased. However, there are questions regarding targeting of the beneficiaries and the governance mechanism of these interventions. We must address these gaps. We should strengthen the monitoring and evaluation system of the social protection programmes. Young people can play a big role in improving the social protection system.

PARALLEL SESSION 2: CLIMATE ACTION

Farah Kabir, Country Director, ActionAid Bangladesh

We have failed to address the root causes of climate change. Our climate actions are not effective. We need to focus more on mitigation and adaptation while conducting research on climate change in Bangladesh. We should ask for loss and damage compensation from those who are responsible for climate change.

Numerous new agricultural practices have been adopted and many of them have negative impacts on the environment and human health. We must be aware of the negative consequences of these so-called agricultural technologies.

PARALLEL SESSION 3: PEACE AND JUSTICE STRONG INSTITUTION

Sheela Tasneem Haq, Senior Governance Specialists, UNDP Bangladesh

We need to work more to make people aware of their right to information. It is not enough to have laws and acts; implementation and monitoring must be prioritised and ensured. We must work on ensuring accountability and institutional responsiveness.

We must work collectively to combat fake news and disinformation. There are many criticisms surrounding the Digital Security Act. Young people should raise their voices about this issue. However, the question arises: since the civic space is shrinking gradually, where and to whom should they express their thoughts?

PARALLEL SESSION 4: GENDER EQUALITY

Kabita Bose, Country Director, Plan International Bangladesh

The dropout rate is higher among girls due to several factors including family mindset, economic condition, societal norms, and inaccessibility to schools. We need to address these to ensure empowerment of women and, thus, eliminate gender inequality.

The absence of transgender people in educational institutes and workforce is a reflection of inequality at the social, political and policy levels. No matter how developed our country becomes, the development will not be sustainable unless and until we eliminate all forms of discrimination.

PARALLEL SESSION 5: RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION

Hasin Jahan, Country Director, WaterAid Bangladesh

The government should provide incentives such as tax rebates to encourage adoption of environment-friendly alternatives. We need in-depth knowledge and appropriate implementation strategies to mainstream the use of these products and technologies. Rainwater harvesting, for example, is a cost-efficient and environment-friendly technique. We have already worked with six industries that use rainwater to wash and dye clothes. Earlier, the factories had to treat underground water before using it since it contained alkaline whereas rainwater doesn't contain this harmful element. We need to promote rainwater harvesting in the industrial sector to make it green.

PARALLEL SESSION 6: DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH

Amrita Islam, Deputy Managing Director, Picard Bangladesh Ltd.

Universities should provide job-relevant skills and practical training to their students. Employers should also come forward to hire freshers and provide the required training. There is huge scope to address these issues in Bangladesh through university-industry collaboration. Recruitment agencies should also focus on connecting young people to prospective job sectors.

CLOSING SESSION

Professor Mustafizur Rahman, Core Group Member, Citizen's Platform for SDGs Bangladesh & Distinguished Fellow, CPD

Our priorities and demands are changing day by day. Earlier, major issues were poverty alleviation and social security but now climate change has emerged as a major development challenge. We need to have adequate preparation to address these emerging issues. Young people can lead us in this effort. They need to be equipped with new skills to be able to face new challenges. They also have to shoulder the responsibility of bringing alienated and left-behind youth groups to the mainstream arena of development.

Asif Ibrahim, Core Group Member, Citizen's Platform for SDGs Bangladesh & Vice Chairman, Newage Group of Industries

We need to invest in the rural economy and develop industry and service sectors there to ensure the employment of the growing number of youths who are looking for decent work opportunities.

Young people should acquire various skills such as developing a business plan and securing financing to establish themselves as entrepreneurs.

We must increase the budgetary allocation for the youth. We need to invest more in their health and education.

Dr. Iftekharuzzaman, Core Group Member, Citizen's Platform for SDGs Bangladesh & Executive Director, Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB)

If we fail to achieve SDG 16 which includes peace, justice, good governance, strong institutions and a corruption-free world, other SDGs cannot be achieved. Unfortunately, Bangladesh is currently in a very dismal condition in all the indexes of this SDG. Bangladesh, for example, is the second-most corrupt country in South Asia, right behind Afghanistan. The negative consequences of corruption and lack of good governance significantly affect everyone in society, especially the marginalised communities. Therefore, young people must play a strong role in combatting corrupting and ensuring good governance.

Gwyn Lewis, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Bangladesh

Youth have a very important role to play in achieving the SDGs. They are important because they ensure the priorities for the future they want to live in. When we talk about young people, we often talk about innovation and employment, but the youth need to be engaged at every level – private-public partnership, policy dialogue, strengthening government organisations, social protection issues, and so forth. We have to make sure the voices of the youth are reflected in every policy and decision.

Youth Declaration 2022

When it comes to the future of a country such as Bangladesh, young people have a pivotal role to play in steering the progress of development. Studies conducted by several international organisations revealed that developing countries which make adequate investments in the education, health, and decent employment of their youth population achieve accelerated socio-economic growth and are able to eradicate poverty at a faster pace. In addition, the adverse impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic have accentuated the challenges already being faced by the youth, whose lives were negatively affected in a number of ways, including schooling and learning outcomes, employment opportunities, and mental health conditions. Adequate government support and social initiatives are needed to help the youth overcome these challenges and become skilled.

The voices of the youth need to be heard to ensure inclusive and sustainable development. We are making the following recommendations on behalf of the youth community:

Education

Adequate steps should be taken to reduce the discrimination in the quality of education between urban and rural areas.

There should be adequate allocation of funds and training facilities to address the gap in education between urban and remote areas created due to the digital divide.

Improve the quality of education by ensuring the use of technology in imparting education. Teachers should also be trained in technology-enabled teaching.

Students should have access to job opportunities and job-market related information.

Policy makers should rethink the higher education system. The education system should ensure the development of labour market-relevant skills.

Special initiatives should be taken to bring back students, particularly female students, who dropped out during the pandemic.

Research facilities should be expanded significantly in universities. Necessary policies should be formulated and adequate funds allocated to ensure this.

Initiatives should be taken to bring those who have been left behind and the alienated section of the youth to mainstream society.

Health

Bring the youth under the coverage of health insurance.

Young people should be made aware of mental health. They should be provided free mental health services.

Mid-day meals should be introduced to all the primary, secondary and higher-secondary level schools.

Employment

Young people should be provided ICT and youth-rights-related training.

Young entrepreneurs, particularly those affected by the pandemic, should be provided training and funds on easy terms.

Necessary support should be provided so that young people can improve their lives through self-employment.

Increase investment in the rural economy to address the educated unemployment issue.

Industries and corporate organisations should train, hire and utilise human resources from among the local young people instead of hiring people from abroad.

Skills training should be provided to aspiring migrant workers.

Young people working in the informal sector should be made aware of health, rights and security.

Living wage should be ensured for young people who are involved in low-paid work including tea workers.

A minimum of Tk 1,000 as social security allowance should be provided to marginalised young people who were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Gender equality

Targeted initiatives should be taken to engage young women in the job sector.

Specific initiatives should be taken to empower young women.

Prevent child marriage. Initiatives should be taken to bring back girls to school who dropped out because of child marriage.

Marginalised youth

Various initiatives should be taken to empower young people from marginalised communities including indigenous people, persons with disability, transgender people, and Dalits.

Marginalised youth should be made aware of their constitutional rights and the initiatives taken for the improvement of their lives.

Poor sections of the youth should be provided credit facilities through credit cards.

Training on freelancing and ICT should be provided to young people who live in remote areas.

Special initiatives should be taken to improve the financial status of the young people who live in remote and hard-to-reach areas.

561,World Sight Day 2022,"REACHING THE UNREACHED: OUR ACTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN EYE CARE IN BANGLADESH

Today, 13 October, marks World Sight Day 2022.In Bangladesh, the number of people in need of eye care is spiralling. In 2020, 19 in every 100 adults aged 30 years or older had visual impairment (Nationwide Blindness Survey 2020). This is a global problem, not just a regional one, and it is estimated that without concerted action the number of people who are blind across the world could triple by 2050.

Marking the celebration of the day, INGO Forum in Eye Health organised the ""Dialogue on Country Planning on Integrated People-centred Eye Care IPCEC as Recommended by the World Report on Vision Towards Universal Eye Health Coverage (UEHC) 2030: Reaching the Unreached – Our Actions and Opportunities in Eye Care"" at hotel Amari Dhaka on 02 October 2022.INGO Forum is an umbrella organisation of Andheri Hilfe, CBM Global, Heart to Heart Foundation, Helen Keller International, The Fred Hollows Foundation, Orbis International, Sightsavers, and VisionSpring which work in eye health care.Government officials, renowned ophthalmologists, representatives from INGO Forum in Eye Health, WHO and other organisations working in the eye care in Bangladesh, public health and disability rights experts joined the high-level policy dialogue. Speakers at the dialogue have suggested taking decentralisation and coordinated actions by the government, non-government and private sectors to reach eye care services to the unreached to attain universal eye health coverage.The key suggestions, discussions and the recommendations from the dialogue are presented in this supplement for the readers.

Keynote by Mohammad Rofiqul Islam, Project Manager-Eye Health, Sightsavers

""Good eye health has a ripple effect on society, improving education, wellbeing, economics, and health outcomes. Eye health is often seen in a silo rather than part of the wider health and development agenda. But eye health equals opportunity, allowing children to learn and adults to earn. It helps individuals, families, communities, and nations, to thrive. Vision impairment is a major public health problem now and set to grow. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals mention leaving no one behind, but there are still many people in that position. If we are to tackle the eye health burden in Bangladesh, continued cross-sector collaboration, well-resourced interventions, funding, and commitments are needed to integrate inclusive eye health into wider health, education, employment, and development systems. As individuals, we should also all take a level of responsibility for our own eye health, by getting our eyes tested twice a year. The WHO World Report on Vision recommends making eye care an integral part of universal health coverage. Integrated People-centred Eye Care (IPEC) is a concept built on the WHO's framework of making health services people centred, i.e., organising health services around people's need and expectations throughout the life course. Eye health needs to be integrated with the wider health systems and other sectors and made within the reach of people in need, to mitigate vision loss and the consequences that it incurs.""

Professor Dr AHM Enayet Hussain

Chair of IAPB Southeast Asia, Bangladesh Chapter &former Director General of Medical Education, MOHFW

""Plans must be taken to reach out to elderly persons, people with disabilities, minority groups, ethnic, marginalised people, including garments and tea garden workers, those leaving in hill areas and others hard-to-reach to ensure inclusive eye care services. It is proven that GO-NGO collaboration can achieve bigger targets and such collaboration must continue to achieve UHC. Eye health should be addressed from the holistic approach. We must set out rehabilitation plans to fulfil the rights of people with vision and blindness so that they can participate in society on equal basis and take part in income generating activities.""

Prof Dr Deen Mohd. Noorul Huq

Renowned Ophthalmologist &Former Director General of DGHS, MOHFW

Bangladesh has gone through a revolutionary change in the healthcare sector, particularly in eye health care, and thanks to all stakeholders for their contribution to the success. There is no alternative to the concept of public-NGO-private partnership to achieve universal eye health coverage and SDGs.The present government has increased the national eye care budget fivefold. The funds to government-run ""community vision centres"" at the upazila level now should come under the government's revenue for their sustainability.Effective coordination between the organisations working for eye care services and National Eye Care is the only way to address eye health problems and all concerned must come forward to overcome any gaps for better results.

Dr. Munir Ahmed

Country Director, Orbis International and Chair, INGO Forum in Eye Health

""In Bangladesh, eye care service delivery is yet to be decentralised at the district level in terms of capacity building of govt district hospitals to provide comprehensive inclusive equitable secondary level quality eye care services. We have only 6 years to achieve a lot by 2030. We need to act now as we have many challenges and limitations. The priority is now to decentralise eye care at the district level, strengthen and monitor our achievements towards universal eye health coverage by 2030.""

Amrita Rejina Rozario

Country Director, Sightsavers & Co-chair, INGO Forum in Eye Health

For accelerating actions to achieve Universal Health Coverage through implementing Integrated People-centred Eye Care; we need to incorporate the recommendations made in the World Report on Vision into our National Eye Care Operational Plan (OP). To reach out to all people with vision impairment at the community level we need to have good number of community vision centres at upazila/union levels, which will account for a great step towards attaining Universal Eye Health Coverage.

Dr. Khaleda Islam

Director PHC (Retd.), Directorate General of Health Services, MOHFW

""Planning of 5th Health Nutrition and Population Sector Program (NPNSP) is now taking place where INGO Forum in Eye Health should work and contribute. If eye health is integrated in essential service package, it will be huge. The curricula of medical students should teach basic eye care.""

Dr. Golam Musfiqur

Deputy Programme Manager, National Eye Care, DGHS, MOHFW

""Currently, 135 upazilas have community vision centres providing comprehensive quality eye care under 7 base centres. Extensive use of technology such as teleconsultations is being used as a solution to the pressing HR challenge. The referral system is effective and well managed. We are thinking of introducing transport support for patients.""

Dr. S Mahfuzul Huq

National Professional Officer, WHO

""We need to explore alternative options to mitigate the human resources crisis in eye care. HR challenges are not confined to eye care only, this problem is even more acute in mental health sector. If nurses are trained and capacitated well, task sharing can play an effective role. Role of other ministries such as education is important; hence, inter-ministerial coordination must be strengthened.""

Dr. Asif Iqbal

Programme Manager (Admin & Finance), Community Based Health Care, DGHS, MOHFW

""Community clinicshave CHCPswho should be given basic training on how to diagnose eye problems by their symptoms. If they were given half-yearly or yearly training, they would grow to be more competent. Even though we have a decent number of sisters in our services right now, it (keeping males beside females) should be taken into consideration as maternity leave often creates a functional challenge.""

Dr. Nusaer Chowdhury

Deputy Programme Manager, Non Communicable Diseases Control (NCDC), DGHS, MOHFW

""NCDC diagnoses diabetes and hypertension, and established NCD corners in upazila health complexes where registration of patients is done,and a handbook is provided. We will soon follow this model in medical colleges as well.We have referral system to refer eye patients to eye consultants. But presently, we are not providing medicines for eye patients.""

Big. Gen. AKM Akhter Uzzaman (Retd.)

CEO, Ispahani Islamia Eye Institute and Hospital

""We have the desire to expand to the community but for the lack of human resources, we cannot expand as much. And we will not find human resources overnight. So, we can use technology as a substitute for human resources. We are still dependent on cornea from outside sources. We have a population of over 160 million, but the culture of donating cornea has not yet developed among us. Here we need a huge social mobilisation.""

Peter Yun

Coordinator, Heart to Heart Foundation

""A system has to be developed to refer eye patients from the rural level to the base hospital for effective delivery of eye care services. The biggest task ahead of us is to strengthen the system to make sure rural people can avail the eye health services from the base hospitals.""

Dr. Arif Ur Rahman, Programme Manager, Helen Keller International

""TheDHiS2 software of the Ministry of Health contains all maternal and child health related data, but it still has not incorporated eye health data. Therefore, concerted efforts are needed to strengthen the DHiS2 system to ensure eye health data is incorporated.""

A. K. M.Badrul Haque

Program Manager, The Fred Hollows Foundation

""If National Eye Care takes the initiative to address data gap in eye care, INGO Forum in Eye Health will be ready to support per need. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics conducts censuses and household surveys, if they consult with us for eye health indicators, this will also help generate nationwide eye health data.""

Dr. Nafeesur Rahman

Researcher & Disability Rights Activist

""Allocation of business of ministries for ensuring the health of people with disabilities must be clearly determined. Health Ministry and Social Welfare Ministry need much more coordination in this context. Comprehensive eye health care is essential if Bangladesh isto achieve the target of Vision 2041 i.e., developed Bangladesh. In that journey, we need to prevent avoidable blindness and advance economic empowerment of visually impaired people.""

Dr. Aftab Uddin, Chairperson, Public Health Foundation, Bangladesh

""We have witnessed an impressive development in the eye health sector in the countryand there are two dimensions of it; quality and quantity. We have a good deal of evidence in terms of quantity and quality. However, we must emphasise on two areas—funding, and research and evidence.""

Dr. Md. Ariful Alam

Programme Head-Health, Nutrition & Population Programme, BRAC

""When we talk about universal eye health coverage, we should considergeography, scope of the services delivered, and the investment needed. BRAC has 20 vision centres that provide services ranging from conducting cataract surgeriesto distributing reading glasses. However, getting the license approval of those vision centres is very challenging.""

Dr. Lutful Husain, Associate Director (CSPTR) Clinical Service, Orbis International

""We need comprehensive analysis and plan to implement integrated people-centred eye care to attain universal eye health coverage. We need to think about how community clinics can be integrated with eye health services delivery. And we must adhere to the concept 'diversity, equity and inclusion' in our planning and execution so that marginalised people are not left behind in eye care services.""

FINDINGS FROM THE KEYNOTE PAPER

""Tackling the eye health burden in Bangladesh will require continued cross-sectoral collaboration, well-resourced interventions and funding, and commitments are needed to integrate inclusive eye health into wider health, education, employment, and development systems.""

KEY CHALLENGES

In 2020, 1.1 billion people worldwide are living with vision loss because they do not have access to basic eye care services. 2 to 3 billion more people need ongoing access to services to optimise their vision and ability to function in society.

Globally, 9 out of 10 people with vision loss don't need to be visually impaired or blind if they have access to eye care services. Without further intervention, the number of people with blindness and vision impairment is estimated to almost double in 2050 than in 2020.

People with blindness are at higher risk of dying early by 2.6 times than people with normal vision.

At least 19% of Bangladesh's population aged 30 years or above have visual impairment and the situation could worsen unless concerted steps are not immediately taken to address this serious challenge.

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

Action for government:

Implementing Integrated People-centred Eye Care requires a core set of actions from national governments:

Include eye health within health system including planning, service delivery, health care financing, information and supplies.

Consider eye health in policies and planning by other government ministries such as education, labour& employment, and finance.

Take government ownership for IPEC with shared responsibility among the service providers and the individuals and communities.

Reorient the model of care with especially prioritising primary and community care. Innovate the models of care for this.

Coordinate services within and across sectors of health. This includes case management, efficient referral, and continuity of care. Sectors of health include neonatal care, noncommunicable diseases, rehabilitation and occupational health safety, elderly care etc.

Proper utilisation of DHiS2 for eye health services to ensure database management for analysis, planning, collaboration and improving interventions in national-level information system for better planning and showcasing the progress made.

Action for civil society:

Work together for supporting implementation of IPEC in the country

Raise awareness about eye health

Engage and empower people and communities about eye care needs. Make them aware about their own eye care needs.

Promote research and generate evidence to complement existing ones for effective eye care interventions.

Incorporate importance of eye health and its integration into health system in the health planning curricula",2022-10-12 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/round-tables/news/world-sight-day-2022-3141546,2023-05-18 10:30:22,thedailystar
562,Exploring the implementation of disability-inclusive WASH policy commitments in Bangladesh,"Syed Ashfaqul Haque, Executive Editor, The Daily Star

About 2.4 percent of our population are persons with disabilities. Unfortunately, we are unaware and insensitive to the problems they suffer in their everyday life. They don't want sympathy from us. They want equal opportunity. The media can play a big role in creating awareness about this issue.

Hasin Jahan, Country Director, WaterAid Bangladesh

We have reviewed 10 WASH-related policies in Bangladesh to find out how the issues of persons with disabilities are addressed in those policies and how the policies are implemented at the field level. Today, we will share our findings with you. We will incorporate your feedback and finalise the study document.

From my 20 years' experience of working in the WASH sector, I have come to the conclusion that we don't understand the disability issue properly. We think that we are not disabled, we are working for other people. But the reality is that after a certain age all of us will need wheelchairs, and if we make our houses disability-friendly it will ultimately help us.

Secondly, we need to think beyond wheelchair-based access. We need to think about creating access for persons who are vision impaired , hearing impaired and have mental disabilities. We all need to work together to achieve this goal.

Dr Dilara Zahid, Assistant Professor & Director, Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies

Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and climate change are included in every programme as crosscutting issues. We can easily incorporate these issues into disability inclusive WASH programmes.

Dhaka Declaration 2015+ was adopted at the Dhaka Conference on Disability and Disaster Risk Management in 2018. It made some useful suggestions regarding disability-inclusive WASH initiatives that can be helpful to carry forward the issue.

Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics provides disaggregated data on disability and WASH sector that will be helpful for the study. We conducted a survey on DRR in 2021 covering all the divisions of the country. The survey had some important findings on the access of persons with disabilities to WASH facilities. The study can benefit from those findings.

Last but not least, we have to mainstream the disability agenda in WASH programming.

Mahbub Ul Alam, Associate Scientist, icddr,b

When icddr,b, Unicef and WaterAid started working on menstrual hygiene management, a steering committee was formed. Can we form another steering committee to work on the issues faced by persons with disabilities? It will not only address the WASH issues but also help promote inclusive design for ensuring accessibility for persons with disabilities in every setting, remove barriers and fight social stigma.

We need to look beyond wheelchair access and expand our programmes to address all types of disabilities.

Media and educational institutions can play a big role to reduce stigma and discrimination towards persons with disabilities.

B-Scan and icddr,b are going to survey the current situation of WASH facilities for persons with disabilities. We hope it will contribute to a better understanding of the issue and make our policies and action plans more effective.

Mohammed Monirul Alam, WASH Specialist, Unicef

We need to engage the private sector. They can play a big role in designing, manufacturing, marketing, and maintaining the supply chain of the products that will facilitate implementation of disability-inclusive WASH programmes.

Dewan Mahfuz E Maula, Coordinator, Policy Advocacy, ADD International Bangladesh

We need to sensitise and train government employees on disability issues. It will make implementation of disability-inclusive WASH programmes easier. The service providers also need to have the basic knowledge of the technicalities of inclusive design and accessibility.

We need to involve organisations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) to make our disability-inclusive WASH programmes sustainable. They will take ownership of these interventions even after the completion of the projects.

The Persons with Disabilities Rights and the Protection Act, 2013 calls for the formation of committees at the upazila and district level to ensure proper implementation of the Act. However, most of these committees are inactive. We need to activate these committees immediately.

Md. Nayeb Ali, Deputy Director, Department of Disaster Management

We need to consider the local environment while designing WASH facilities for persons with disabilities. In Rangpur and Gaibandha, for example, there are many chars that remain submerged in water during a certain period of the year. We have to consider these realities while establishing WASH facilities in these areas.

You will be happy to know that all the cyclone shelters and flood shelters are now designed to address the special requirements of women and persons with disabilities.

Salma Mahbub, General Secretary, B-SCAN

The WASH sector needs to understand the different requirements of different types of persons with disabilities and find solutions accordingly.

We need to provide support to OPDs so that they can sustain and work for their rights. They need to be involved in monitoring the accessibility of the infrastructure built for persons with disabilities. They also need to be trained on WASH issues. The government is going to build toilets across the country. OPDs should be included in this process. We also need to ensure the participation of OPDs in WASH-related research and data collection projects.

There are several emerging issues such as WASH and menstrual hygiene that need to be included in the Persons with Disabilities Rights and the Protection Act, 2013.

Tony Michael Gomez, Social and Behaviour Change Expert

If the existing policies were implemented properly, a lot of our problems regarding access for persons with disabilities to WASH facilities would have been solved now. People can get away with flouting the disability-inclusive guidance and, therefore, they care very little about it.

Universities talk about innovations and organise various competitions. Do they care about designing products or facilities for persons with disabilities? We need to invest more to create disability-friendly solutions and change the prevailing attitude towards persons with disabilities.

Dr Sheikh Daud Adnan, Deputy Director (Hospitals and Clinics), Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS)

The government has already formulated a law that clearly mentions what services a person with disability will get in public settings. However, we have to identify what changes need to be incorporated into the Persons with Disabilities Rights and the Protection Act, 2013, so that we can provide better services to persons with disabilities.

A bigger sample size would have made the study more comprehensive. The study should also include other forms of disabilities and the different types of problems they face. I would like to know how we can improve the accessibility of persons with disabilities in hospitals.

S.M. Tariquzzaman, Regional WASH Specialist, Asia Pacific, Plan International

The Persons with Disabilities Rights and the Protection Act, 2013 recognises 21 types of disabilities. If we can create facilities for 4-7 types of disabilities, we will be able to cover all types of disabilities. Since we only focus on creating wheelchair access, which is the costliest intervention, we tend to think that creating accessibility for persons with disabilities is very expensive. However, only 8-10 percent of persons with disabilities need wheelchair support. There are many interventions that can help a large number of persons with disabilities with very little funds. We need to invest in those solutions and find more innovative techniques to provide support to persons with disabilities.

Syeda Asma Rashida, Project Manager, Sightsavers Bangladesh

We need to understand inclusivity from a broader perspective. For example, we can provide toilet facilities for persons with disabilities in a regular toilet setting if it is designed in an inclusive way. We can design the handle of a tube-well in such a way that a person with disability can use it.

We need to engage the Department of Public Health Engineering in our effort to make the WASH sector disability inclusive.

There should be a clear guideline in the Persons with Disabilities Rights and the Protection Act on how to turn the policies into actions in order to accomplish its goals and objectives.

Mohammed Shah Alam, Executive Director, Neuro-Development Disability Protection Trust

A government-industry-NGO nexus should be established to boost disability-inclusive WASH initiatives. Persons with disabilities should be involved in designing the solutions they need. They should be included in all the infrastructure projects, particularly in the approval process of housing projects.

Our education curriculum should be designed in a way that promotes disability inclusiveness in every sphere of life. Last but not least, there should be disability desks in all government and non-government organisations to look after the well-being of persons with disabilities.

Tanjim Ferdous, In Charge, NGOs and Foreign Embassies, Business Development Team, The Daily Star & Moderator of the session

Around 2.5 percent of our population are persons with disabilities. They face significant barriers to accessing water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Lack of access to WASH facilities has serious impacts on the physical and mental well- being. We need to keep in mind that persons with disabilities have the same rights as any other person to WASH.

Chief Guest's Speech

Ashraf Ali Khan Khasru, State Minister, Ministry of Social Welfare

We have achieved a lot of success in addressing the problems of persons with disabilities. Earlier, persons with disabilities used to be considered a curse and a burden. However, that attitude has changed over time, particularly due to the tireless effort of our Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her daughter Saima Wazed Putul.

All the educational institutions now have ramp facilities. This was made possible due to the special instruction of our honourable Prime Minister. Her daughter has achieved international recognition for her contribution to the well-being of persons with disabilities.

We need to work more to stop open defecation and improve sanitation facilities in rural areas. We should consider all types of disabilities while designing WASH facilities for persons with disabilities.

Currently, the government is establishing submersible pumps in rural areas. These pumps are installed with tanks and several taps. This has made access to water facilities easier for persons with disabilities. The government is also supplying water by establishing overhead tanks.

In rural areas, wheelchair users face difficulties due to poor condition of roads. We need to look at this issue and find suitable solutions.

It is an election pledge of our Prime Minister that all the villages will be transformed into towns. We will ensure that all urban amenities are available to rural people.

I must appreciate WaterAid's effort to highlight the importance of making the WASH sector disability inclusive. I will try to provide all kinds of support to this effort from my ministry.

Keynote Speech

Mahfuj-ur Rahman, Project Manager, WaterAid Bangladesh

The study was jointly conducted by London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, WaterAid Bangladesh and Identity Inclusion, and supported by funding from the Australian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Water for Women Fund. We have secured ethics approval for this project from Bangladesh Medical Research Council. This was a 24 month-long project which is going to end in September 2022.

The study found that all the 10 reviewed WASH-related policies, action plans and guidelines have a strong focus on the disability issue, particularly developing infrastructure for improving access to home and public settings. However, the problems of affordability, protection from harm and access to high-quality WASH services were not emphasised strongly in these policy documents. The gender dimensions of disability inclusive WASH initiatives need further attention. A significant gap in these policies is the lack of recognition of the critical role played by caregivers.

There is a gap in coordination between WASH and disability sectors in Bangladesh. Although the WASH issue is covered in the disability-related policies, it is not systematically addressed at the grassroots level. There is also a knowledge gap among service providers regarding disability-inclusive WASH facilities. In Rangpur and Gaibandha, for example, people have easy access to tube-wells but those are not fit for the use of persons with disabilities. Similarly, the toilets lack the necessary features to ensure access for persons with disabilities. These gaps compromise privacy and create inconvenience for them. Unfortunately, persons with disabilities are not much aware of their right to WASH. It is a positive sign that organisations working with persons with disabilities are now raising their voices to make all the WASH facilities disability inclusive.

We have drawn the following recommen-dations from the study: strengthen inter-agency coordination between WASH and disability sector with a clear plan of action and agreed milestones; follow existing disability inclusion guidelines while implementing national policies; increase investment to create awareness and build technical knowledge and skills of the service providers; prepare a comprehensive compendium incorporating all the accessibility features and demonstrate it at the household level at a mass scale; prepare a harmonised, disaggregated and accessible database on disability and WASH; formulate indicators and monitoring checklist to track plans and progress properly; and ensure meaningful participation of persons with disabilities and caregivers in WASH projects.

563,Mental Health: The Role of Media,"LifeSpring and The Daily Star jointly organised a roundtable titled “Mental Health: The Role of Media” on September 12, 2022. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Yahia Md Amin, Lead Psychologist and Chairman, LifeSpring & Moderator of the Session

To improve our mental health ecosystem journalists and mental health professionals should work together. We need to make people aware of the importance of mental health. We have to take care of our mental health and help others with mental health problems.

Syed Ashfaqul Haque, Executive Editor, The Daily Star

We don't feel comfortable talking about mental health issues. Mental health is still taboo in our society. We need to change this mindset.

Journalists work under huge stress. The nature of their job poses a risk to their mental health. We talk about the role of the media in the promotion of mental health. But we must also ensure the mental well-being of journalists.

Dr. Sayedul Ashraf, Lead Psychiatrist and Managing Director, Life Spring & Keynote Presenter

According to the National Mental Health Survey of Bangladesh 2018-19, 21.5 percent of the population is suffering from mental disorders. In Bangladesh, 29 persons die every day from suicide. At Life Spring, we are seeing a rise in patients by 3-5 times following the outbreak of the pandemic. However, Bangladesh Mental Health Survey of 2018-2019 estimated that 92.3 percent of persons with diagnosable mental disorders were not receiving mental health treatment. The current treatment gap for adult is 92.3% and for children is 94.5%. That means, in Bangladesh, 9 out of every 10 people with mental health issues do not receive treatment. Media can play a crucial role in addressing this by promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders. I would request them to take special care when reporting on suicide. It shouldn't be portrayed as a heroic act.

Dr. Md. Kamal Uddin, Professor & Chairman, Department of Psychology, University of Dhaka

Journalists should be trained on how to best report on mental health and suicide. They should be more careful about reporting on negative issues so that it doesn't create mental stress for readers.

Prof. Dr. Jhunu Shamsun Nahar, MBBS, FCPS (Psychiatry), Ex-Chairman, Department of Psychiatry, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University

Stigma surrounding mental health is still widely prevalent in our society. Media can play a big role in destigmatising this issue. They should make people aware of the importance of mental well-being and promote mental health. They can also provide information about affordable mental health care and therapy options available in the country.

Naziba Basher, Sub-editor, The Daily Star

As journalists, it is our responsibility to provide information without triggering our readers, some of whom might be patients of mental disorder. Therefore, each and every word used in a report related to trauma, suicide, and abuse, has to be curated very carefully.

At The Daily Star, for example, we use the phrase 'die by suicide' instead of 'killed himself' or 'committed suicide'. If journalists have the awareness that mental illness is like any other medical illness, they will be able to report on this issue more responsibly.

Azim Hossain, General Manager, Channel I Digital

Traditional media houses are now facing steep competition from social media both in terms of capturing audience's attention and advertising. A responsible media outlet has to maintain certain standards that might be of least concern to a YouTube channel or a Facebook user. The algorithm of social media platforms promotes sensational content that has negative impacts on our mental health. Therefore, there should be a code of ethics for all types of content creators. As individuals, we should discourage production and consumption of sensational content.

Abu Sayeed Khan, Advisory Editor, The Daily Samakal

Bangladeshi media have made good progress in reporting on sensitive issues. Most of the media houses, for example, avoid publishing images of victims and dead bodies. However, there are also many gaps that should be addressed to make our media industry more accountable and responsible. Journalists should be provided training on how to responsibly report on mental health issues. There should be a monitoring mechanism to promote creation and distribution of good content across different media platforms.

Farzana Akter, Lecturer, Department of Clinical Psychology, Dhaka University

There is a clear media guideline for reporting on suicide safely. Journalists should follow that. They have to ensure that they provide information without triggering or creating stress on the audience. They can also seek opinions from mental health experts for reporting on critical cases.

The media has already played a significant role in promoting mental health in Bangladesh. We need more support from them to destigmatise the issue. They can also help us to take the issue to the grassroots level.

Shafiqul Alam, Bureau Chief, AFP

All the reputed international media have guidelines for ensuring the mental well-being of their employees. They have developed journalists' guides to cover sensitive stories. They also assess the mental health of their employees on a regular basis. Unfortunately, these facilities are absent in local media houses. We should raise our voices to bring about improvements.

Dr. Golam Mostofa Milon, Consultant Psychiatrist, LifeSpring

Journalists as first responders cover violent crimes and horrific accidents that pose risks to their mental health. Many of them suffer from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If we want good journalism, we have to take care of the physical and mental well-being of journalists.

Dr. Abdun Noor Tushar, Physician and Media Personality

When we talk about mental disorders, we don't address the underlying reasons. In our society, families have set roles for children. All of us aspire to get GPA 5. It creates huge mental stress for our children. This mindset must change.

We need to make people aware of digital well-being. Students should be taught how to use social media. We need to bridge the cultural gap between students and teachers. We need to listen to our young people.

Mst Hasina Khatun, Member, Bangladesh Clinical Psychology Society

In 2017, WHO issued a guideline for safe and responsible reporting on suicide. Journalists should follow that guideline. We should report on suicide in such a way that readers become aware of the causes of suicide and take preventive measures.

Professor Dr. AAMS Arefin Siddique, Former VC, University of Dhaka

Journalists as change agents have a big role in promoting mental health in Bangladesh. They should report responsibly on mental health issues and cover the full spectrum of mental health – from mental illness to mental well-being.

Journalists must uphold the ethics of journalism. New ideas may emerge in the media landscape but the ideals of ethical journalism – truth and objectivity – will remain the same.

The Government of Bangladesh should increase expenditure on mental health care.

564,Policy Café on Women’s Safety in Public Places,"National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Young Bangla of the Centre for Research and Information (CRI) and the Human Rights Programme of UNDP jointly organised a Policy Café titled “Women’s safety in Public Places” on August 8, 2022. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Barrister Shah Ali Farhad,

MPP Candidate, University of Oxford & Moderator of the session

Policy Café is one of the signature programmes of the Centre for Research and Information (CRI). It provides a platform where young people can discuss various public interest issues with relevant stakeholders from the public and private sectors. The topic for today's Policy Café is Women's Safety in Public Places. This programme is jointly organised by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Young Bangla of the Centre for Research and Information (CRI) and the Human Rights Programme of UNDP.

Israt Farzana Tanni, Assistant Coordinator, Young Bangla, CRI

We started our campaign for women's safety in public places in 2020. Our goal was to reach the young people at grassroots level and listen to their viewpoints regarding the issue. The campaign took place in 10 districts including Dhaka, Narayanganj, Rangamati, Barishal, Chattogram, Patuakhali, Bogura, Rajshahi, Narail and Khulna. We also ran the campaign online. More than 4 million people have been reached through this campaign. Today, we will share their perspectives with you.

We found that the following stakeholders can play a significant role in ensuring women's safety in public places: law enforcement agencies, transport owners, city corporations and municipalities, market and shop owners, religious leaders, and civil society organisations.

In the online survey, 87 percent of women said that they faced harassment in public places. 36 percent of women faced harassment in transport and 23 percent endured harassment on roads and highways. Women also face harassment in the cyberspace. We asked how they responded to such incidents. 36 percent of women said that they protested while 34 percent did nothing. We wanted to know why women feel unsafe in public places. The lack of respect for women, overcrowded public transport and the lack of access to legal service were identified as the major reasons behind this situation. 34 percent of the female respondents shared that they didn't get any support from the public when they faced harassment.

The following recommendations came from the young campaigners at grassroots: end the patriarchal attitudes and the culture of fear; enhance women-friendly facilities and social services; and strengthen the legal framework to ensure safety of women in public places. Some of the general recommendations include: zero tolerance for sexual harassment issues and developing a separate law to address all forms of sexual harassment; inclusion of gender-focused education from the primary level and conducting awareness-raising campaign regularly.

Rokeya Kabir, Executive Director, Bangladesh Nari Progati Sangha (BNPS)

We often say 2 lakh women lost their 'honour' during the Liberation War. This narrative should be changed. It is not the women but the perpetrators and the men -- the self-proclaimed 'protector' of women -- who should be ashamed of losing their 'honour'. We must recognise the fact that women equally participated in the war.

A BBS study shows that 90 percent of women face harassment at their home. Women are unsafe in both public and private spheres. Therefore, on the one hand, we have to change the patriarchal mindset of society, and on the other hand, we have to ensure protection and safety of women in both public and private domains. We have to uphold human rights and democracy. Gender-based discrimination is prohibited under the constitution of Bangladesh. Therefore, women must be treated as equal citizens of the country. I must thank the honourable law minister for placing the Anti-Discrimination Bill 2022 in the parliament. Last but not least, we must reform the inheritance law.

Rosa, Youth Representative

I travel to Barishal by launch regularly due to my job. On one such journeys, I realised that a person was following me as soon as I boarded the launch. It was around 1 am at night. When I returned from the washroom, I saw the person in front of my room. I screamed and gathered some people including the staff of the launch. I was talking about legal action against the person. But the launch authorities and some passengers requested me not to do that. Some of them even raised questions about my attire and asked why I was travelling alone at night. After returning home safely, I shared the experience with my friends and family members. They also suggested that I do not travel alone. As a citizen of the country, I want to live my life freely and safely and this has to be ensured at any cost.

Prithi Mejbaheen, Youth Representative

A large number of women face harassment in public transport. There should be transports exclusively for women.

Sadat Rahman, Youth Representative

Women often become victims of cyberbullying. In rural areas, the local police and lawyers are not that aware of cybersecurity laws and regulations and, therefore, women and girls living there face difficulties in seeking legal remedies. Members of the law enforcement agencies and lawyers need to be trained on these issues.

Amena Begum, BPM, DIG, Special Branch and President, Bangladesh Police Women Network

There is an all-women's cyber support service known as Police Cyber Support for Women, at the police headquarter. They received around 70,000 complaints in 6-7 months. It shows the wide prevalence of cyberbullying in our society.

The government has prepared some laws and regulations to fight cybercrimes. Members of the law enforcement agencies and lawyers who are working at grassroots levels also don't have sound knowledge about cybercrime-related laws and regulations. We are developing an online curriculum to sensitize the two lac members of the police force about gender issues.

Currently, we are trying to raise awareness about cybercrimes. We are providing training on the safe use of the internet.

With regard to the transport sector, we have pasted awareness stickers on buses and passenger sheds and made passengers and transport workers aware of sexual harassment in public transport.

Last but not the least, we need to improve our education curriculum and textbooks by including gender awareness materials that promote gender equality.

Md Helal Uddin, President, Bangladesh Shop Owners' Association

90 percent of salespeople are women in foreign countries whereas in Bangladesh, salespeople are invariably men. Moreover, they don't have adequate training in salesmanship. Therefore, we often get complaints that our salesmen don't behave properly with the customers. We need to provide training on salesmanship. We can significantly reduce sexual harassment in shops and marketplaces if the law minister and city mayor take initiatives to make it compulsory for every shop to have 50 percent female salespersons.

Neelima Akhter, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges

People involved in the transport sector address my male counterpart as 'Sir' but they call me 'apa'. I have no issue with the word 'apa' but it reflects their inherent resistance to accept women in any important position. Hence, we should focus on changing the mindset of our society so that we learn to respect women.

We have a shortage of data on the transport sector and the problems associated with it. I have taken note of the findings of the online survey, and I must appreciate their effort. We are not doing enough to prevent sexual harassment on public transport. However, only punishment can't reduce the occurrence of such incidents. We have to create mass awareness regarding these issues.

We launched a special BRTC bus service only for women starting with 23 buses. Currently, only 7 of these buses are in operation due to the dearth of female passengers. Most of the female passengers are not well-informed about the routes of this bus service. With proper data we can realign these routes. There will be a coach exclusively for women on the metro rail, and it will have full CCTV coverage. Currently, the transport sector is controlled by private enterprises. We are working to rationalize the bus routes in the capital. If it is done properly, a lot of problems in this sector will be resolved.

Last but not least, we have to create more scopes for train drivers. The corporate sector should come forward in this regard. They should also play a leading role in recruiting female drivers.

Nasima Begum ndc

Chairman, National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh

Violence against women is unacceptable in any civilized society. To continue the country's growth, we must empower our women. Bangladesh has achieved significant success in ensuring gender equality. However, the incidents of violence against women tarnish our image.

To combat sexual harassment, we formulated a draft law following the High Court's guidelines. We have already submitted the draft to the honorable minister, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. I sincerely hope that the law will be passed soon.

National Human Rights Commission recently made an inquiry into the causes of sexual harassment and solutions to this problem. We discussed with all the stakeholders and accommodated their observations and suggestions in the inquiry report.

In response to the recent rape incidents on roads, we suggested that authorities bring the roads and vehicles under CCTV coverage.

Jasmin Ara Begum, Member, National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh

In 2009, the High Court issued 12 directives regarding the prevention of sexual harassment. Based on these directives, we have prepared a draft and submitted it to the law ministry. They are currently working on it. There are committees in every district working on the prevention of sexual harassment. We have suggested in our draft to make these committees accountable. If they fail to perform their duties, they will be punished.

Our main focus should be on changing the mindset of our society. There are youth clubs in schools. There are also many NGOs and CSOs which work on this issue at grassroots level. We should partner with these organisations to make our interventions more effective. We must ensure timely and adequate punishment of the perpetrators so that people refrain from harassing women.

Rokeya Kabir has emphasised ensuring equal inheritance for all women. We must ensure that they at least get what is rightfully theirs according to the existing arrangement.

Lastly, the religious leaders should be requested and, if needed, warned to refrain from making negative comments about women.

Van Nguyen, Deputy Resident Representative, UNDP

Safe cities and safe public spaces for women are a fundamental human right. But unfortunately, harassment and sexual violence are an everyday occurrence for women and girls across the world, including in Bangladesh. This reduces women's and girl's freedom of movement – to participate in school, work, and public life.

Ensuring safe public spaces for women spans across all of our work: on a recent visit to Sylhet during the devastating floods, I got the opportunity to talk to women in cyclone shelters who reported feeling unsafe without designated women's spaces in the shelter. It is important we listen to the experiences of these women and ensure their safety, including in disaster responses.

On another note, only 1 percent of women have reported incidences of harassment to law enforcement agencies. By engaging more female police officers in crowded public spaces such as bus stations, we hope to make women feel safer in their daily lives. UNDP is committed to working with the Government to ensure law and order, enabling every single citizen, and especially women, to seek justice without barriers.

But waiting for the law will not be enough. We believe prevention is key: we must educate everyone to become responsible citizens. Only this way we can ensure public spaces for women for generations to come.

Abdullah Al Zubayer, Youth Representative

I was closely involved with the campaign. As part of the campaign, we collected 105 case studies of which 3 rape victims live in a building in Narayanganj. They didn't get any help from the local administration. We should seriously address this issue. There should be adequate lighting and CCTV on the highways.

Chanchana Chakma

Indigenous people face many problems. They are not even recognised in the way they want to identify themselves. I believe, I have the right to develop and maintain my distinct identity and characteristics.

We indigenous women face harassment. This issue should be given due importance.

Tahmina Akhtar Nupur, Youth Representative

There are many religious influencers who preach hate against women and those videos are being uploaded on social media platforms like YouTube. Why aren't these videos being removed, even though we have a Digital Security Act? The law enforcement agencies must take action against these hatemongers.

Atiqul Islam, Mayor, Dhaka North City Corporation

We should promote the concept of working together. Instead of reserving seats for women on buses, we have to develop a society where a woman can sit beside a man without facing any harassment.

RMG is the biggest export sector in Bangladesh and 80 percent of foreign currency comes from this sector. Women workers are the key force in this sector. We can proudly say that they are leading the export sector of Bangladesh. In garment factories, male and female workers work side by side.

The Dhaka North City Corporation has taken several initiatives to make the city safe for women. We have recovered 24 parks in the city and opened those for both men and women. We have launched an app named ""Shobar Dhaka."" It often happens that we see a problem in our city but we don't know where to lodge a complaint. Now you can do this through this app.

We are going to introduce the ICE (In Case of Emergency) option in the app. If anyone faces any problem and presses the button, it will send an emergency text immediately to three of their close contacts. Also, we can always call 999.

Many of our youths are doing small businesses these days. But when it comes to getting a trade license, city corporation staff don't cooperate with them which results in delays and hassles. We have received official approval that everyone will be able to get a trade license online from December 2022. Also, we are introducing a QR code that will be attached to rickshaws so that by scanning the code one can easily get all the information about the rickshaw and rickshawpuller. It will make our rides safe.

Anisul Huq, Minister, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs

Bangabandhu has taught us how to respect women. In his memoir, he repeatedly talked about his wife's commitment and trust that encouraged him to dedicate his life to the liberation of Bangladesh.

In terms of formulating laws to prevent violence against women, Bangladesh is well ahead of many countries. The country passed the Cruelty to Women (Deterrent Punishment) Ordinance in 1983. We also have other relevant laws to fight violence against women. We are currently working on the draft submitted by the National Human Rights Commission. However, laws alone will not be enough to solve the problem. We need to ensure the proper implementation of these laws.

Violence against women is a deep-rooted societal problem. We have to identify the root causes of this problem. We have to take a societal approach to this issue. Now, it is a good time to address this problem because a large number of Bangladeshi women are now self-reliant; the country has made significant progress in all development indicators. It is now a lot easier to disseminate information and connect grassroots people. We are seeing changes in the mindset of general people. We are also seeing a cultural shift. We need to exploit these opportunities to bring a change in the mindset of our society and reduce the rate of violence against women. Also, we need to raise our voices against all forms of harassment and violence.

We have to live by example. You must have heard about the Nusrat rape case. We tried to set an example by ensuring immediate punishment for the perpetrators. It will refrain others from committing such heinous crimes. I promise you that the perpetrators involved in the recent case of rape on the bus will be brought to justice very soon.

There have been many questions and much confusion regarding the Digital Security Act. It was enacted to combat cybercrimes. We have no intention to curtail freedom of speech. We will arrange more training on the Digital Security Act.

We can't resolve the case backlogs within a very short time. However, we are trying to address this issue through the digitization of the judiciary, addition of new judges and adoption of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. I hope, we will see a big change within 2-3 years.

Finally, I urge the young people to use their talent and energy for the betterment of the country. We will provide all kinds of support to you.",2022-09-05 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/round-tables/news/policy-cafe-womens-safety-public-places-3112136,2023-05-18 10:30:26,thedailystar
565,Rivers and our future,"The Daily Star organised a roundtable titled ‘Rivers and Our Future’ on June 4, 2022. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Mahfuz Anam, Editor & Publisher, The Daily Star

Rivers are one of the most important resources of Bangladesh. Unfortunately, we have proved ourselves as a short-sighted nation by not taking care of these invaluable resources. Many voices have been raised and many media outlets have expressed the urgency of saving our rivers, but no significant change has happened.

I was ecstatic when the High Court issued a directive to demarcate the rivers, thinking it was an epoch-making directive for the conservation of rivers. In reality, it appeared to be a curse instead of a blessing as the demarcation pillar legitimised river-grabbing.

The Daily Star has been very vocal about protecting the rivers in Bangladesh. We will continue our efforts in this regard. I would like to request you all to put forward your suggestions on how the rivers in Bangladesh can be saved.

Mohammad Golam Sarwar, Assistant Professor, Department of Law, Dhaka University

In 2011, the government amended the Constitution and inserted Article 18A which states, ""The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to preserve and safeguard the natural resources, bio-diversity, wetlands, forests and wild-life for the present and future citizens."" It highlights the importance of intergenerational equity and sustainability.

Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act 1995 was also amended in 2010, and a clause was added to protect water reservoirs. The clause states, ""It is prohibited to fill the land or change the class by other means which is already specified as water reservoir."" However, there is an exception on the grounds of ""national interest"". What constitutes ""national interest"" is not clearly defined in the law. There are ample examples of grabbing and filling water reservoirs by exploiting this exception.

Bangladesh Water Act 2013 is a comprehensive piece of legislation that aims to integrate and coordinate water resource management in the country. This law stipulates, ""All rights over the water within the state territory shall, on behalf of the people, be vested upon the State."" This is contradictory to the international human rights law which recognises the people as the right-holders and the State as the duty-bearer.

The National River Conservation Commission Act of 2013 is the most relevant law for protecting the rivers. But the Act has turned the Commission into a mere recommending body which does not have any enforcing and monitoring authority. The Draft National River Conservation Commission Act of 2020 has many loopholes that need to be addressed seriously.

The High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh delivered a historic judgement declaring rivers as a legal entity and assigning the government as the legal trustee in protecting the rights of waterbodies. The judgement also directed to empower National River Conservation Commission. The judgement identified river encroachment and river pollution as criminal offences and directed for establishing a separate trial process to ensure speedy disposal of these cases.

The most challenging aspect of our environment-related laws is that these laws give enormous power to the executive without ensuring an effective accountability mechanism. These laws also contain provisions to save the officials in the name of good faith. However, there is no clear definition of what constitutes 'good faith'.

According to Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act and Bangladesh Environment Court Act, no environment court shall take cognizance of an offence except on the written report of an Inspector of Department of Environment. This provision restricts a person's access to the court. As a result, the number of cases in our environment courts is still very low.

Dr. Muzibur Rahman Howlader, Former Chairman, National River Conservation Commission (NRCC)

The Water Development Board has the power as a prosecuting agency, but the problem is that they have not filed any case against any river-grabber so far. The Parliament has given the executive branch enough authority to take initiatives to save the rivers, but the government officials are not interested in stepping in. Therefore, building institutional capacity is crucial. We also have to ensure the accountability of the institutions that are responsible for protecting the rivers. There must be a strong political will to protect the rivers. National River Conservation Commission needs to be strengthened through allocation of adequate human and financial resources. We undertook a massive campaign across the country to make people aware of the importance of protecting rivers. Unfortunately, we could not continue due to a shortage of funds.

Malik Fida A Khan, Member, National River Conservation Commission (NRCC)

Three major problems regarding our rivers are grabbing, pollution, and maintaining navigability. The impact of climate change is another big issue, especially in the coastal areas. As far as the solution is concerned, we have to think from a regional perspective, since we have 54 international rivers with India and three rivers with Myanmar. In 2011, a framework agreement was signed between Bangladesh and India which stipulated that the two countries would focus on river basin organisation. However, we could not make any progress in this regard. The water quality of the transboundary rivers is crucial for us, and we have to ensure it at any cost.

A strict law could be helpful to prevent river-grabbing. Those who work for the conservation of rivers should also be rewarded. Civil societies have to be more vocal to protect the rivers.

Dr. Asif Nazrul, Professor, Department of Law, University of Dhaka

The government has three organs: legislature, judiciary and executive. They have to be functional, efficient and accountable. We also need to ensure good governance. Without bringing in such fundamental changes, formulation of laws, however good, cannot protect the rivers.

India and Nepal have made significant progress in creating reservoirs while no meetings at the political level have taken place in accordance with the MoU signed between India and Bangladesh in 2011. We have been discussing the Teesta water-sharing issue with India for more than 50 years. We still do not have the rightful share of Teesta's water. Also, there has been no progress in river conservation and water-sharing since the signing of the Ganges Water Treaty of 1996 when the two countries decided to share the water of all the international rivers according to a no-harm and equitable utilisation principle. We see progress only in the case of the Feni River which happened due to the interest of India.

There are two international conventions: the 1977 Water Course Convention and the 1992 UNECE Convention. Now, any UN member state can join the UNECE Convention. If Bangladesh becomes a member of this Convention, it will be able to raise various river-related issues such as integrated resource management and basin-wide development, in a more substantive way.

Sharmeen Murshid, Former Member, National River Conservation Commission (NRCC)

The four fundamental principles of our country are democracy, socialism, nationalism and secularism. We need to add a new principle to protect our rivers as well as the environment. A paradigm shift is needed both in terms of our political ideologies and setting the future goals.

It is unfortunate that 90 percent of rivers are being occupied, polluted and dried up because of negligence of the government. The way to solve this is to completely change the way of thinking regarding the environment. We have to hold people's representatives accountable for their stance regarding environmental and ecological issues.

If we want to make the politics of this country eco-friendly, nature-based, and river-based, we have to create a sense of compassion for rivers among the common people of the country as well. They have to be made aware of the environment and river-related laws so that they can challenge any wrong being done to the rivers.

Dr. Md. Mujibur Rahman, Former Professor, Department of Environmental Engineering, BUET

Based on a study we conducted, we recommend public disclosure of the pollution status of all rivers. This would be a very strong tool in terms of keeping citizens informed about the state of rivers. To get the rivers out of these conditions, there is also an urgent need for routine monitoring by the government and citizens. Secondly, policy intervention and industrial management interventions for curbing industrial pollution are necessary as well. The pollution is happening because of factories and industries. And while there are laws, they are not enforced.

The rate of siltation must be reduced. River banks with dense vegetation cover generally have lower siltation rates than those with sparse vegetation. While dredging rivers is important, we should not unmindfully excavate and dredge rivers.

Sharif Jamil, General Secretary, Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon (Bapa)

While we talk about saving our rivers and waterbodies, there have been very few attempts in trying to protect them; instead, we are only legalising river-grabbing. If there was an actual initiative to protect our rivers, then river-grabbing would stop at some point.

We are not aware of the differences between various waterbodies and, therefore, we are recommending the same solution to all river-related problems. The government, for example, has built similar types of sluice gates for Chalan Beel and coastal rivers which do not work.

The government needs to be made aware of the economic losses caused by the pollution and grabbing of the rivers. The Joint River Commission would not be able to resolve the river pollution issues only. We need a strong regional body to address such regional problems.

ABM Imdadul Huq Khan, Advocate, Supreme Court of Bangladesh

The National River Conservation Commission Act of 2013 was revised and a new draft was formulated. This revision was required since we had rushed to make the draft following the court's order and it was not made with a rights-based approach in mind. Some of the points of the court's order were incorporated verbatim in the new draft. But the law should clearly spell out implementing mechanisms in accordance with the court's directives.

As per the law of 2013, establishing brickfields near waterbodies is strictly prohibited. But it has been observed that there are around 550 brick kilns near the waterbodies and 78 percent of all brick kilns are within 1 km radius of rivers and lakes. How did one get permission from the government to set up a brick kiln near a water body? There is no mechanism to hold government officials accountable for their negligence. Executive, legislative and judiciary need to work together to establish a strong accountability regime.

SM Mizanur Rahman, Coordinator, Save Boral Movement, Chatmohor

The Baral River, originating from the Padma at Charghat in Rajshahi, flows into the Jamuna at Baghabari in Sirajganj district through the four districts and connects with 30 rivers in Chalan Beel area. Due to faulty construction of sluice gate, cross dams and concrete roads, the river is now experiencing a slow death. We have been carrying out a movement to save the Baral River since 2008. While the movement to save the Baral River is 200,000 signatures strong, we are facing tremendous challenges. One of these is that influential people including a municipality mayor are polluting and grabbing the river. Also, there is a lack of coordination and cooperation between different ministries of the government which leads to serious damage to the rivers. We will continue our movement in the future. We need to raise a strong community voice to save our rivers.

Sheikh Rokon, Founder and Secretary-General, Riverine People

The river has a deep relationship with society. Every ecosystem has a flagship feature and our flagship feature is the river. All of our ecosystems would function excellently if the rivers were fine and taken care of. But greed has led to river-grabbing for personal profits, not to mention the general pollution of rivers by dumping of waste and landfilling.

I want to highlight three points regarding how a river dies. First, a river dies culturally and loses its cultural value to people. Secondly, it dies organically due to pollution. Finally, it dies physically due to river erosion, grabbing, pollution, sand extraction, and so on.

There was a time when people used to cherish the rivers, but now the river has lost its economic and cultural value. We need to raise awareness about the value of our rivers.

Bareesh Hasan Chowdhury, Research Lawyer, Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association (BELA)

Last year, BELA filed a Public Interest Litigation covering all the rivers in the country. We received an order on the PIL in November 2021. The court said three things in the order. Firstly, to identify the exact number of the rivers in our country; secondly, to liberate Turag River by demarcating the borders; and thirdly, the court asked the government to prepare a time-bound action plan for removing all encroachments from the rivers. NRCC reported that the number of encroachments is 63,000 but, if you go through their report, the actual number is 56,000. Such discrepancies cause a lack of action.

We need to codify the Polluters Pay Principle so that the polluting industries are made to pay for the pollution they inflict. Secondly, there is huge plastic pollution in our country. We need to curb the reckless use of plastics and reform our waste management system.

Manik Hossain, Community Leader

Once the Buriganga River was an integral part of our life. It was abundant in fish and other water resources. But the mouth of the Adi (original) Buriganga River was closed in 2010. As a result, the western side of the river was rapidly grabbed by land grabbers. They are also grabbing other waterbodies connected with the river. In 2019, the High Court ordered to recover the lands of the river following the CS and RS maps. But BIWTA set up demarcation pillars incorrectly which further legalised encroachment.

Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Chair of Parliamentary Standing Committee on Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change

It is necessary to see river conservation and protection on a larger canvas. A river is not just a water body; it is also integrally connected with our overall development. If we fully realise the importance of environmental resources, we will be able to protect those resources.

In the past couple of years, 1,65,000 acres of forest land were slated to be used for development. Even the government itself is taking reserve forest lands to construct buildings, roads, and railways and establish Union Parishads. There is a lack of political understanding of the importance of the environment.

Article 18A, which focuses on the protection and improvement of the environment and biodiversity, is placed in the Fundamental Principle of State Policy section. Although fundamental principles are not judicially enforceable, they ""shall be applied by the state in the making of laws, shall be a guide to the interpretation of the Constitution and of the other laws of Bangladesh."" Are we properly following this constitutional obligation?

If we fail to protect our environment, we will not be able to achieve the SDGs. We need to address environmental issues within our budget and planning framework as well as in our policy statements.

Another issue is the tanneries and the pollution that they are generating. Whenever we approach these industries, they set their priorities as financial goals without due care for the environment. Chromium or chrome recovery facilities are missing as well, meaning that the tanneries operate without any provision for solid waste disposal and treatment. Government agencies have to lead by example. If a government body violates the law, how can I expect a citizen to obey it?

We do not value our natural capital. Natural capital is valued in many countries around the world. We have requested to maintain a satellite account to value our ecosystem services. We need to develop a baseline of our natural capital. We have proposed to formulate a law on ecocide to address the issues of willful destruction of the environment.

566,Invest more in girls,"CARE Bangladesh, in association with The Daily Star, organized a roundtable to share CARE’s investment study findings on June 28, 2022. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Rawnak Jahan, Acting Director, WGEP, CARE Bangladesh

The Tipping Point Initiative of CARE Bangladesh addresses the root causes of child early and forced marriage (CEFM) through gender transformative social norms programming. It is a multi-level advocacy initiative. Under this initiative, we have conducted a study titled 'An Analysis of Evidence of Priorities, Nature, and Size of Investment of Government and Donors in Response to Girls' priorities and SDG-5. The study evaluated how these investments are impacting girls' lives in Bangladesh. Today we will share the study findings with you. We are seeking your recommendations for making the study inclusive and effective to eliminate child marriage in Bangladesh through advocacy initiatives.

Mahmudur Rahman Khan, Technical Coordinator- Research, M&E, CARE Bangladesh.

The study tried to identify the priorities for girls in Bangladesh. These include creating spaces for girls to meaningfully participate in dialogues; ensuring a conducive environment for girls within the family to decide on their life goals; ensuring equal opportunities in education and learning; ensuring girls have access to capacity building and livelihood opportunities; and equal access in ICT-based platforms; ensuring positive attitude of community towards the collective initiatives; access to SRHR information and services; access to adolescent-friendly mental health and psychosocial support; and creating a supportive legal and policy environment.

The study also identified gaps in relevant investments in response to girls' priorities. Although the allocation for the Ministry of Labor and Employment increased by 4.8% in the national budget for FY 2021-22, the ministry doesn't have any precise annual development plan for developing skills of adolescent girls, and existing programs are not accessible to girls under 18. The implementation of the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017 and the National Plan of Action for Eliminating CEFM are still weak. Additionally, there are gaps in inter-ministerial and inter-departmental coordination in terms of designing programs, implementation and avoiding duplication.

REFLECTION FROM PARTICIPANTS

Sigma Ainul, Senior Programme Officer, Population Council

We need to rethink the effectiveness of our preventive measures. An underlying cause of child marriage is the lower status of women in our society, and we must invest in girls to improve their status.

We have to provide them education and life skills, such as SRHR, critical thinking, and financial literacy which should be made at an early age, perhaps around 12, so that, we can build assets to support them in their future journey.

Our training programs generally focus on home-based livelihoods such as raising cattle and poultry and sewing. We need to bring girls to public spaces and increase their visibility.

Investment has to be made alongside the government and they have to be kept involved and updated to ensure the best use of our limited resources and scale up the good practices.

Schools are the best place to reach girls. We need to ensure that mental-health counsellors who work with schools are making students aware of the harmful effects of child marriage.

Reefat Bin Sattar, Director- Program Development and Quality, Save the Children.

We have to first understand that child marriage isn't a disease itself, it's a symptom. What's more important is to look at what's happening within education, livelihood, and health programs because those are inextricably linked to child marriage.

We need to focus on four areas. Firstly, we have to ensure voice and space for girls. Second, girls should be seen as human capital. Third, there should be adequate legal and policy support to prevent child marriage. Lastly, we have to change the societal attitude towards girls.

Increasing budget allocation is important but increase in spending is necessary as well. There should be a strong oversight mechanism to track and monitor public expenditure on girls.

Masuda Rehana Begum, Joint General Secretary, Bangladesh Mahila Parishad

We should think and consider safety and financial stability while investing in girls. Investment without a clear focus will not bring any effective change.

Civil society can play a big role in monitoring the public expenditure on girls. We must build a strong social movement to eliminate child marriage. We have to put pressure on the government to monitor the activities of the child marriage prevention committees at the grassroots level.

We want our girls to be established as independent human beings. To achieve this, we need to change the mind-set of their family as well as school teachers. The government must take the lead, and all of us have to work under the same umbrella for the betterment of our girls.

Zarfisha Alam, Manager, Gender Justice and Department, BRAC

We need to change the social norms that a girl's eligibility for marriage decreases as she ages. In order to create a conducive environment for women choosing non-traditional livelihoods, the family members need to be counselled as well.

Girls are required to be minimum SSC graduate to receive govt. training. We have to advocate for the inclusion of dropouts and those who don't have an SSC certificate. There is a strong link between school dropout and CEFM.

Ruma Sultana, Program Coordinator, Security and Rights of Women and Girls, Manusher Jonno Foundation (MJF)

The Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017 includes a provision that allows child marriage in 'special circumstances. The minimum age of marriage under this special provision should be specified.

K.M. Syeduz Zaman, Consultant, SRHR, FPAB

An autonomous body should be established to coordinate among programs for the elimination of child marriage.

All our interventions happen to be donor driven, instead of being driven by girls' demands. We should come out of this approach. Moreover, we should go beyond a project-based approach and undertake long-term initiatives to address the child marriage issue. We also need to involve the government in our initiatives so that they can carry forward the program and implement the good practices on a national level.

Sohanur Rahman, CEO, Bangladesh Model Youth Parliament

The Global Synthesis report (2017) on the economic impacts of child marriage warned that child marriage would cost the world $4tn by 2030. We need to conduct a similar study to measure the economic cost of child marriage in Bangladesh. It will help us understand the importance of investing in girls for ending child marriage.

Md. Jamal Uddin, Advocacy & S.ACC Coordinator, World Vision

Local government representatives are generally reluctant to prevent child marriage. Their support is key to preventing child marriage at the grassroots level. We need to engage religious leaders to bring changes to our existing social norms.

The implementation of the CMRA 2017 is still very poor. The minimum age of marriage under the special provision of the act should be specified.

We need to strengthen our advocacy efforts to bring a positive change in our existing social norms.

Rabeya Begum Kalpona, Executive Director, SDS

We provide various types of training to girls at the grassroots level. Most of the girls are interested in tailoring. They do not show much interest in learning non-traditional skills, such as mobile phone repairing, graphic design and auto mechanics. The reason behind their lack of interest is that women generally don't do these works in our society. We need to encourage women to adopt these non-traditional professions.

Sadia Karim, Project Coordinator- Adolescents & Youth & Gender Mainstreaming, Educo Bangladesh

Transformative thinking should be spread among both boys and girls. If a boy is aware of the harmful effects of child marriage, he would be able to say no to it. This is why we must involve boys in the fight against child marriage.

Dr. Farhana Ahmed, Director- External Relations, New Business, Marie Stopes Bangladesh

Girls suffer greatly due to their lack of knowledge about SRHR. We will not be able to prevent all child marriages. However, if these girls have adequate SRHR knowledge, they will be able to delay their first pregnancy, and that will significantly reduce maternal mortality rates and other maternal health risks.

Younger adolescents are often neglected in our SRHR programs, so we should seriously address their needs.

Shawkat Akbar Fakir, Coordinator- Women Economic Empowerment, ActionAid Bangladesh

The local government institutions need to be engaged actively in the child marriage prevention initiatives. A systematic and integrated effort is needed to achieve a reduction in child marriage.

567,Allocations for children in Bangladesh’s public expenditure,"Professor Mustafizur Rahman, Distinguished Fellow, Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) (Keynote Presenter)

In FY2015-16, the government, for the first time, prepared a separate budget for children. This was a reflection of the government's commitment towards raising the welfare of Bangladesh's children.

Children, belonging to the 0-18 year age group, make up two-fifths of our population. Ensuring the well-being of children is a development issue and also a rights issue enshrined in our Constitution and embedded in various government policies.

Between 2013 and 2019, Bangladesh made commendable progress in several child indicators such as infant mortality rate and stunting. On the other hand, progress was stalled, and even reversed, in terms of several other indicators particularly because of Covid-induced shocks. A BIGD (2020) study revealed that about 59 percent of students had lower protein intake and 34 percent of the households were compelled to reduce food expenses for adolescents. These negative footprints will leave long-term implications for the subsequent growth of children if not addressed properly with targeted interventions. The key finding of these surveys is that children were disproportionately affected by the pandemic. If a certain group is disproportionately affected, you will have to give them disproportionate treatment in order to bring them to the same level as others. We need to keep this in mind when we discuss allocations for children.

Studies indicate that deprivations experienced by children at the early stage of development are difficult to adequately compensate for through interventions during subsequent stages. Any mitigating interventions at a later stage also prove to be highly costly. Consequently, investment in children is considered as an act of paying forward. It is important for Bangladesh to undertake and prioritise time-sensitive investments in today's children while the country's demographic window of opportunity is still open.

According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, allocation for children in FY2018-19 was found to be only about 14.1 percent of the national budget. The aspiration of raising this share to 20 percent by 2020 was mentioned in the budget speech of FY 2018-19. However, this was estimated to be only 15.3 percent in FY2019-20. Regrettably, child budget reports for the next two fiscal years (FY2020-21 and FY2021-22) have not been prepared.

CPD in partnership with UNICEF, as part of the EU-UNICEF Public Finance Facility for Children project supported by the European Union, undertook an exercise to estimate the child budget figures for FY2021-22. The objective was to highlight the need to increase the share of child budget in public expenditure, and enhance allocative efficiency by drawing attention to the specific needs of Covid-affected children.

The study found that while the budget of the selected 15 ministries/divisions in FY2021-22 has increased by 15.8 percent compared to the pre-Covid FY2019-20 budget, the share of child budget in total public expenditure had remained more or less the same. Over this period, the amount of the child budget rose to Tk 90,868 crore from the previous Tk. 80,197 crore, a growth of 13.3 percent. However, the share of the child budget in total public expenditure indeed saw a slight decline (from 15.3 percent to 15.1 percent); the same was the case in view of the GDP (from 2.78 percent to 2.63 percent).

If we look at the sectoral distribution, we see that 6 percent of the child budget has gone to the education sector, 12 percent to children's health and 13 percent to various social safety net programmes. However, only about 1 percent has gone toward child protection. Since issues such as child labour, child marriage, learning losses and violence had acquired urgency during the pandemic, there is a need to allocate more resources in view of these emergent needs.

We also need to take note of not only monetary allocations but also issues such as timeliness and quality of implementation, effective management of the projects and overall good governance. To recall, average spending during the first 10 months of FY2021-22 by the 15 child budget concerned entities was only 49 percent. Thus, the share of implemented child budget was lower than that of allocation.

Based on the above study, we would like to put forward a number of suggestions. First, the child budget should be prepared and published on a regular basis. Second, efforts should be taken to meet the target of 20 percent of all public expenditures to be spent on children. Third, allocations in the child budget should be geared towards addressing current concerns and future needs of children. Fourth, targeted measures are needed to address Covid-induced challenges including compensating for learning losses, bringing dropped out children back to school, ensuring their access to essential health services, preventing child marriage and child labour and providing children with a safe environment to live and grow up in as productive adults. Fifth, social safety net programmes for children need to be expanded both horizontally and vertically with a special focus on early-year programmes (e.g., Universal Mother and Child Benefit Programme, for which we have already seen some improvements in the budget for FY2022-23). Sixth, child budget should be prepared considering the shifting demands of the children. Addressing Covid-induced adverse impacts should not only inform allocative priorities in the child budget of FY2022-23, but also the budgets to come in the next few years. Finally, implementation of child-centric measures in the budget should be reviewed on a regular basis with multi-stakeholder participation.

Veera Mendonca, Acting Country Representative, UNICEF Bangladesh

Bangladesh has made rapid improvement in many child indicators including under-five mortality, stunting and access to education. However, there are a number of key issues that still need to be addressed. 75 percent of our children who pass secondary school do not have the right competencies for learning. 51 percent of our girls get married before the age of 18. The compounding effects of the Covid-19 pandemic added to our woes. Schools were closed for a long time; many children were impacted by the pandemic which will have long-term effects.

Bangladesh is currently enjoying a demographic dividend which makes investment in children crucially important. Can we invest in programmes that are targeted to bring those children back to school who had dropped out during the pandemic? This is the time to invest in nutrition, health, and water and sanitation to ensure that every child gets the opportunity to grow up to attain their full potential. We also hope that the new budget will address harmful practices such as child marriage and violence against children. We have to keep in mind that investing USD 1 in children today is going to give us USD 13 in return in future.

Shaheen Anam, Executive Director, Manusher Jonno Foundation

Children are not a homogenous group. There are many different groups within children – those from impoverished households, children from remote and hard-to-reach areas, and those with disabilities. Our budget must address the needs of all these different groups of children, particularly the vulnerable and marginalised children. It is unfortunate that the social welfare ministry, the key ministry tasked with ensuring protection of children, receives one of the lowest budgetary allocations.

We always talk about allocation, but we don't pay adequate attention to the monitoring and implementation of these funds. We, civil society organisations, are not able to monitor how the allocated funds are being used and to what extent the children are benefiting from these funds. Some key indicators to look at in this regard are the health condition of children, their education, and child marriage.

All our social safety net allocations go to the family since the family is supposed to take care of the children. However, our study shows that many incidents of child abuse and neglect happen within families. We need to think about how we can provide support to families so that children are protected.

Kashfia Feroz, Director-Girls Rights, Plan International Bangladesh

The national plan of action to end child marriage is the key tool to monitor and measure our progress in terms of child marriage. I urge the government to allocate necessary funds for the effective implementation of this action plan.

In the first four months of this year, 366 cases of violence against children were filed (ASK data) which shows the enormity of the problem. I strongly recommend raising the child protection budget from 1 percent to 10 percent of child budget.

Dr. Eiko Narita, Country Representative, UNFPA

One of the key investment areas is education, particularly adolescent girls' education. We have to make sure that girls stay in school throughout the secondary school period.

Girls generally start skipping school when they experience menstruation. It is also a cultural symbol that the girl is ready for marriage. There is a clear link between menstruation, school dropout and child marriage. We have to look at this linkage when we allocate budgets for adolescent girls.

Rasheda K Choudhury, Executive Director, CAMPE

We see negative growth in the allocation for children in the budget of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. This is unacceptable since the honourable Prime Minister has repeatedly highlighted the importance of creating a progressive cultural environment for children.

The mid-day meal programme was supposed to be an incentive to bring children back to school and better their nutritional status. The prime minister also pledged that by 2024 we would have universal mid-day meal coverage. The programme, affected by the pandemic, should be restarted in all earnest to reach the target on time.

The Bangkok Statement, adopted in the recently concluded 2nd Asia-Pacific Regional Education Minister's Conference, focuses on return, retain and catch-up. As a signatory to this statement, Bangladesh should keep in mind these three commitments when it makes budgetary allocations for children. At the conference, delegations from India and Pakistan submitted citizen budgets. We can also undertake a similar initiative.

Maurizio Cian, Head of Cooperation, Delegation of the European Union to Bangladesh

In the coming years, money from development partners will reduce; also various trade preferences will no longer be available. However, it needs to be recognised that Bangladesh has the strength, both in terms of human capital and financial resources, to graduate and walk on its own.

The social protection budget for children focuses mainly on early childhood development. There are various national and international initiatives to support this phase of childhood. We should also allocate resources for other stages of children's lives including the adolescence period.

Different organisations have different types of data on children. This data needs to be shared among relevant stakeholders.

Khan Md. Nurul Amin NDC, Chief (Additional Secretary), General Economics Division (GED), Ministry of Planning

We must ensure food, shelter, health, nutrition, education, and decent living conditions for every child. Our national planning document clearly mentions how to achieve this goal: ""More investment for children will be a priority of the Government during 8FYP. Following strategic actions will be undertaken: (a) evidences are generated to advocate for greater and better public investments for children by way of analysing child focused budgeting including preparation of budget brief, pursuing fiscal space analysis including institutional investment plans for children, pursuing public expenditure review for children, pursuing cost-benefit analysis of selected interventions for children, (b) capacity of duty bearers enhanced in child focused budgeting process, (c) involvement of citizens (including children) to empower them to participate in budgeting process to improve transparency and accountability"" (8th Five-Year Plan, pg. 18).

The document further mentions, ""Child focused budget gradually needs increasing allocation for effective coverage. The incidence of child malnutrition has reduced significantly. However, progress in the area of children's nutrition requires additional effort. The incidence of child poverty is high, and the implementation of the consolidated Child Benefits Program recommended by the NSSS needs to be fast-tracked. Implementation capacity for enforcement of the Children Act 2013 also needs strengthening and needs deployment of a dedicated social service workforce for children including children with disabilities"" (pg. 15).

We have clear policy guidelines regarding child welfare. We need to enhance our capacity to implement these programmes and mobilise local resources towards this.

Dr. Shamim Jahan, Acting Country Director, Save the Children in Bangladesh

A separate directorate should be established to strengthen the focus on children. There should be strong coordination among different government departments and ministries regarding the allocation of budget for children and proper implementation of child welfare programmes.

Data validation is critically important. We need to involve the private sector in child welfare programmes.

Mahfuz Anam, Editor & Publisher, The Daily Star

Budgetary allocation and expenditure for children is a topic that deserves adequate media attention. Collaborative efforts are key to pursuing these issues. I want to highlight one sentence from Dr. Mustafizur Rahman's presentation which says, ""We need to talk about not only monetary allocation but also the timeliness and quality of implementation, effective management and overall governance of the process."" The Daily Star would like to cover all these aspects. Please help us with your knowledge and resources in this regard.

Aroma Dutta, MP, Member of Parliamentary Standing Committee on Ministry of Social Welfare

We need to focus on tracking and monitoring. It would help us know where and how to make investments. We need to have more interaction with the concerned ministries including Planning, Finance, Education, and Women and Children Affairs.

Our schools should have two curriculums so that students can gain more technical knowledge. Bangladesh is earning a significant amount of foreign exchange by sending her human capital abroad, but its children are not getting enough opportunities. These gaps need to be addressed. We also need a separate ministry for the children.

MA Mannan MP, Honorable Minister, Ministry of Planning

We are fighting on many fronts including poverty reduction, food security and creating employment. Children are the weakest link in the development chain. They need special care and attention. Despite many limitations, we want our children to have the best education. This is a huge battle and the government is keen to pursue this. We would like to pay more attention and allocate more funds for Bangladesh's children. I fully endorse the idea of a citizens' budget for children.

There has been a significant rise in the incidence of child marriage during the pandemic. If these girls come back to school, they should be given not only a stipend but also other benefits in appreciation of their long journey back to school.

We must stop the wastage of government funds. Our honourable Prime Minister has called on everyone to prevent wastage and make the best use of funds. I am earnestly seeking the media's help in this regard.

568,Issues faced by plainland ethnic minority communities in Bangladesh,"Traidcraft Exchange in association with The Daily Star organised a roundtable titled ‘Issues faced by plainland ethnic minority communities in Bangladesh’ on June 21, 2022. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.

Nabila Nusrat, Head of Programme, Traidcraft Exchange

Traidcraft Exchange has been implementing the 'Fighting Forced Labour with Adivasi and Dalit Communities in South Asia (MUKTEE)' Project in Bangladesh since 2019. The project is co-funded by the European Union.Agriculture Sustainable and Socio-Economic Development Organization (ASSEDO) is the implementing partner.

The MUKTEE Project has been implemented in two Upazilas --Tanore and Nachole – in Rajshahi. We are working with the plainland ethnic minority communities of these areas to address the systematic and structural weaknesses they suffer from.

There are three main reasons behind their suffering. Firstly, they don't get the same treatment as mainstream Bengali citizens and are not skilled enough in income-generating activities. Also, they suffer from various health complications, particularly premature aging due to hard manual labour. Lastly, the natural resources in their living areas are depleting rapidly, and, therefore, they are losing their alternative sources of food and ways to earn a living.

Unfortunately, there is no social safety net programme to support these vulnerable communities. We started working on two areas: food and income opportunities. We are trying to include them in social safety net programmes so that they get food assistance. They are also being trained in various skills so they can participate in income-generating activities.

Foyzul Bari Himel, Consultant, TTC

Over the years, people in ethnic communities have been deprived of things that are rightfully theirs, such as the ponds in their localities or the fruits growing on trees that they themselves planted. They are faced with these restrictions because they are made to believe that there will be problems as these are the properties of zamindars. They have been suppressed generation after generation, held back from being able to reach a position where they could do or think for themselves.

Rabiul Alam, Executive Director, ASSEDO

Being mainly an agrarian working class, the introduction of automotive technology has greatly reduced the number of work opportunities for plainland ethnic minority communities. Our target for the MUKTEE Project has been to enhance the skill of this group and create alternative livelihood opportunities for them, teaching them things such as sewing, masonry, mobile phone servicing, etc. We have also provided training on various hardware and software programmes for members from 2,000 families. Although our training period was only two weeks long, it has led to them finding jobs in fields not related to traditional agriculture.

Sagor Marandi, World Vision

The MUKTEE Project has been successful in helping the disadvantaged ethnic minority communities generate some savings from their income, but whether it has been done with sustainable solutions remains to be seen.

The situation of the tea workers in Sylhet is an example of modern slavery. They are underpaid, deprived, and discriminated. A tea worker can't work outside the tea garden, and we were not allowed into the garden to talk with them.

Camillus Kamol Gandhai, Project Coordinator Development, CARITAS

We work with the indigenous people, especially the Santals, who have their own traditional social organizations. We make sure that even after our project is completed, the indigenous people can help themselves through their organizations.

The government should be involved in the development of ethnic minorities. Representation of the ethnic minority communities must be ensured at the policy level.

Mohammed Rabiullah, Program and Research Officer, SEHD

The Ministry of Cultural Affairs has enlisted 50 ethnic communities, though some ethnic communities have still been left off the list. They should be recognized by the government immediately, and they should also be included in the ongoing national census.

Sheikh Shahed Rahman, Chief of Party, Save the Children

The education policy of 2010 pledges that all the children from ethnic minority communities will be given early education in their mother tongue. Although some ethnic groups receive books in their mother tongue, there aren't enough teachers to instruct them.

The Department of Youth Development has the aim to develop the skills of all young people by 2025 and the youth from these communities must be included.

Amitabha Ghosh, Senior Program Manager, IRI

Generally, women in our society are vulnerable. However, the women from ethnic minority communities are more vulnerable as they have little access to local administrative bodies to lodge a complaint.

Alexius Chincham, National Project Coordinator, ILO

The Government of Bangladesh has adopted various policies and laws to protect indigenous peoples in the country and establish rights in line with international norms. However, the government has yet to ratify ILO Convention 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples.

There should be separate ministry for Plainland communities, such as the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs that looks after the issues of ethnic communities who are living in Chittagong Hill Tracts.

Md. Tajul Islam, Adviser, Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST)

We have found that there are three primary reasons ethnic minority communities lose their land. One is the acquisition of land by the government and autonomous bodies. Another is the forceful eviction of these people from their homes and lands, and the last is the process of land transfer. The DC offices do not keep a record of lands that have been illegally transferred.

AKM Mamunur Rashid, Program Specialist, UNDP

Starting from primary school, we must begin teaching acceptance and accommodating others at a cultural level. Second, we must motivate the members of the ethnic minority communities to think outside of just owning land as a means of livelihood. Thirdly, most of the farmlands in the northern areas are being transformed into orchards since fruit cultivation requires less water and labour.

Aroti Munda, A representative from Munda community

We still face discrimination in getting access to government services. We are educated and yet struggle when we go to government offices. Just imagine how an uneducated community member feels at that place. They wouldn't even want to go there to begin with. So how will our rights be ensured if we aren't treated as equal citizens?

The MUKTEE Project has helped us, and we do not take money from the Mahajan anymore. We have formed a cooperative association and take loans from it with lower interest rates. It has helped us become independent, and it has also encouraged us to save for our future. Now, we are confident to seek services from government offices. However, we still don't get all the government allowances. None of our women, for example, have received maternity allowance from the government. If there were officers from our community, we would have known about these issues.

Biplob Coda, A representative from Coda community

We often hear that tribal people cannot dream. This isn't correct. They can dream bigger dreams, but it's just that they aren't given the right opportunities, and they don't have enough leaders to guide them. They also face harassment in many places which often crushes their dreams.

Government officials often omit our surname from national IDs and government records. For instance, one of my relatives is named Ajin Coda but in his national ID his name is mentioned as Ajin. The registrar omitted Coda from the records as our family title seemed uncivilized to him. Now, my uncle Ajin cannot get government allowances for underprivileged ethnic groups of the plains as the government officials want proof of his indigenous identity.

We hear about quota in government jobs for indigenous people, but on the ground, there is no such thing. There have been instances where we have been asked to pay BDT 800,000/- just to be considered for a government job.

Shahed Ferdous, Country Director, Traidcraft Exchange

From the very beginning, the MUKTEE Project has been working with multiple stakeholders because we know that it is not possible to address issues of the ethnic minorities all by ourselves.

We need to promote locally led initiatives and establish strong local institutions so that the plainland ethnic minority communities can address their problems on their own.

In the second stage of this project, we will try to institutionalize the savings initiatives of ethnic minority communities by forming cooperative associations.

We can form a caucus involving all the relevant stakeholders to address the issues faced by the plainland ethnic minority communities in Bangladesh in a coordinated way.

569,No let-up in price hike,"When people are already struggling to cope with high prices of daily essentials, a fresh hike in the prices of soybean oil, sugar, onions, and potatoes has dealt them a further blow.

This will only force them to dig deeper into their pockets at a time when inflation is close to double digits.

Crude soybean oil refiners on Wednesday raised the price of one-litre bottled soybean oil by Tk 12 to Tk 199 while the price of loose soybean oil was increased by Tk 9 to Tk 176 a litre. A consumer has to pay Tk 960 for a five-litre jerrycan, which was Tk 906.

Bangladesh Vegetable Oil Refiners' and Vanaspati Manufacturers' Association hiked the prices after consulting with the commerce ministry and the Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission.

A commerce ministry official said the VAT on edible oil was reduced to 5 percent from 15 last year in the face of soaring prices of the cooking oil. The benefit expired on April 30 and the VAT is back to 15 percent.

As the prices of edible oil are dropping in the international market, the government did not extend the facility, he said.

On the other hand, retail price of sugar rose in the capital over a week. A kg of loose sugar is currently being sold for Tk 130-Tk 140, which was Tk 120-Tk 130.

On April 8, the government set the price of loose sugar to Tk 104 and Tk 109 for a kg of packaged sugar.

Prices of potatoes and onions have gone up by Tk 5 a kg over a week, putting consumers, especially those of limited-income, in further difficulty.

A kg of potatoes is now being sold at Tk 30 to Tk 35 while onions cost Tk 55 to Tk 60 a kg.

The retail price of eggs also rose by Tk 10 a dozen. A dozen is now Tk 140-Tk 150.

""The prices of almost all essential commodities have been increasing, but not our income. How could we survive in this situation?"" Sukkur Ali of West Tejturibazar told The Daily Star yesterday.

He said he is left with no other option but to cut consumption as the fresh hike will only spell more trouble for his family.

""I'm thinking of not providing my children and elderly mother with eggs every day as I cannot afford it after paying the rent and other fixed expenses.""

Anamul Haque, who works at a private bank in Chattogram, said they have already cut consumption of desserts like payesh and shemai because of the high prices of sugar.

""Now I may have to consume these desserts once a month instead of once a week,"" he said, adding that he was expecting a relief from price hike after Eid, but that did not happen.

Visiting different kitchen markets in the capital yesterday, this correspondent saw traders selling a kg of loose sugar for Tk 130-Tk 140. Last week, its price was Tk 120 to Tk 130, according to the traders.

Tofail Ahmed, proprietor of Al-Amin Store in Karwan Bazar, said he usually stores sugar after buying it from Moulvibazar wholesale market in Old Dhaka.

He said suppliers at the wholesale market told him that there has been a shortage in supply for about a month.

Tofail said last week he bought packaged sugar for Tk 125 a kg although the retail price mentioned in the packets is Tk 109. He added that he sold a one-kilogram packet of sugar for Tk 130.

According to the National Board of Revenue, sugar imports dropped by about 25 percent, or 2.29 lakh tonnes, in the first four months of the year compared to the same period of 2022.

The country's annual demand for sugar is 25 lakh tonnes. But domestic production can supply only 1 lakh tonnes.

Md Gofran, proprietor of Cumilla General Store in Karwan Bazar, said he tried to buy a few cartons (four 5-litre jerrycans) of soybean oil for his regular customers after hearing about its possible price hike on Wednesday afternoon.

But he could not as the distributors told him that the commodity was unavailable, he said.

He, however, could buy a few cartons at a higher price. He added that a carton cost Tk 3,560, which was Tk 3,480 on Wednesday.

Ghulam Rahman, president of Consumers Association of Bangladesh, said hiking price of soybean oil by Tk 12 a litre is not logical.

""The price of soybean oil has considerably declined in the international market. Although the government has withdrawn VAT privilege considering the price drop in the international market, the oil price should not have increased this much.""

The refiners are making extra profits giving the VAT withdrawal as an excuse. Some big companies are controlling the market in the absence of strict monitoring by the government, Ghulam said.",2023-05-05 01:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/food/price-essentials/news/no-let-price-hike-3311221,2023-05-18 10:30:32,thedailystar
570,Cardiac Treatment: Patients hit hard by costly stents,"Mohiuddin Ahmed was extremely anxious. And it was just not because his 68-year-old father was undergoing a cardiac stent implantation surgery. He had no idea how he would pay back the creditors for the funds he borrowed for the operation in March.

His worries would not have been this overwhelming had the government not hiked the price of cardiac stents by 20-35 percent from February 1 to factor in the steep depreciation of taka against the dollar, making the already expensive cardiac treatment in Bangladesh more costly at a time when the ordinary people are grappling with the rising cost of living.

""It is too much for my family,"" Ahmed, a lawyer, recently said. He needed three weeks to arrange the Tk 3.64 lakh needed for the surgery at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) after the heart blocks were detected.

Each stent was billed at around Tk 1 lakh, more than double the price in India.

Take the case of the Xience Xpedition stent made by Abbott, an American medical devices manufacturer. It costs about Tk 47,000 in India and Tk 70,000 in Nepal.

But in Bangladesh, its maximum retail price is Tk 125,500 after the hike by the Directorate General of Drug Administration, up from Tk 108,628.

Such big differences were found in the case of stents of other companies like Boston Scientific's Promus Premier and Promus Elite, German company Biotronik's Orsiro and Medtronic's Resolute Onyx.

In India, the price of stents starts from Rs 9,842 and goes up to Rs 35,835.

The price of stents in Bangladesh is determined as per the markup set by the DGDA's price-fixing committee. The markup was set at 1.42 percent, which includes the taxes and profit margin of the suppliers as well as the dealers. It also includes an 11.5 percent ""retail commission"" for middlemen.

And the recent hike was made to factor in the depreciation of taka as per the markup set, said Mohammad Yousuf, the director-general of DGDA.

In the past year, the taka depreciated 23.7 percent against the dollar, according to data from the Bangladesh Bank.

""If the suppliers did not need to pay a commission to the physicians, health staffers and different middlemen, the price would have been much lower like in India."" — Chowdhury Meshkat Ahmed, professor at BSMMU's Department of Cardiology

""The stent market was in an unruly state. We tried our best to draw an accepted and transparent solution for the sake of patients,"" said Afzalur Rahman, a former director of the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease (NICVD) who led the 2017 expert committee for fixing stent prices.

The time has come to revisit the markup formula to ensure transparency in the stent supply chain, he said.

The drug administration must explore ways to bring down the price, said Abdullah Wadud Chowdhury, head of the cardiology department at Dhaka Medical College Hospital.

""Otherwise, patients would prefer going to India for cardiac care,"" he said.

The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority in India fixes the price of stents for foreign manufacturers, while the global companies supply at a discount to Nepal, considering the country's economic status, according to Chowdhury.

""In the case of Bangladesh, however, they follow the European standard. If we can bargain with the companies, the price can be lowered,"" he added.

On May 2, the DGDA along with the experts sat with the representatives of Boston Scientific Corporation and Abbott Laboratories at its office in Dhaka.

The representatives agreed to submit a proposal regarding a feasible price cap for their stents, The Daily Star has learnt from officials informed on the proceedings.

DGDA officials said they will also sit with the rest of the principal companies as early as possible.

Chowdhury Meshkat Ahmed, professor of the Department of Cardiology at the BSMMU, however, highlighted another reason for the higher price.

""If the suppliers did not need to pay a commission to the physicians, health staffers and different middlemen, the price would have been much lower,"" he said.

The Daily Star found credence to Ahmed's claim after speaking with four local suppliers of cardiac medical devices.

""Mainly the physicians get the commission and it is 20-50 percent of the stent price. Every supplier has their own strategy in this regard. Some may also pay the other health staffers involved in the process,"" said an official of a local supplier on the condition of anonymity.

Ahmed went on to call for transparency in the supply chain. ""The physicians need to stop taking financial benefits from the companies. Otherwise, patients will continue to suffer,"" he said.

Each year, about 45,000 stents are implanted in around 25,000 patients, according to Chowdhury.

For now, the price hike of stents will leave more cardiac patients out of treatment, according to Mir Jamal Uddin, director of the NICVD.

""Were the price of stent less than Tk 50,000, it would have been bearable for our family amid the high inflation,"" said Mohammad Unus, whose father-in-law was undergoing the same procedure as Ahmed's father at the same time on March 20.

Inflation averaged 8.85 percent in the first 10 months of the fiscal year, way higher than the 5.6 percent target set for fiscal 2022-23 in the budget.",2023-05-06 01:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/cardiac-treatment-patients-hit-hard-costly-stents-3312006,2023-05-18 10:30:33,thedailystar
571,ChatGPT at the point of care,"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being explored in the medical field to improve clinical practice. One such AI tool is ChatGPT, an online chatting interface based on the Generative Pre-trained Transformer technology. This large language model is trained on the entire internet corpus and can generate, summarising, synthesising text, and can do way beyond the conventional imagination. While the public has shown great interest in ChatGPT, clinicians may not be aware of its practical applications in routine medical practice.

Recently, researchers published an essay in the New England Journal of Medicine highlighting some of the specific ways in which ChatGPT, specifically the latest iteration GPT-4, could be used. In one example, GPT-4 listens to a recorded clinical encounter and generates a clinical note that captures the medical facts and psychodynamics present in the interaction. This technology has the potential to alleviate the burden of clinical documentation in electronic medical records, replacing the need for scribes in many cases.

Furthermore, it could generate a summary of a patient's medical history before a visit, streamlining the pre-visit chart review process. Patients could also use a chat-based service to query their records and receive understandable information and feedback.

Another potential use of GPT-4 highlighted in the essay is 'curbside consultation'. In this scenario, a clinician asks GPT-4 what to look for when evaluating a dyspnoeic patient with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease for exacerbation. GPT-4 generates a concise discussion of diagnosis and management. While the advice given by GPT-4 may not always be superior to existing online sources of medical information, the authors suggest that exploring longer conversations between clinicians and GPT-4 about complex patients could be beneficial.

Although artificial intelligence, including GPT, offers many benefits for medical practice, there are still challenges that need to be addressed. One significant challenge is that large language models like GPT do not have an innate understanding of text. Instead, they synthesise text that appears intelligible but may ""fill in the blanks"" with information that is not necessarily grounded in truth.

This presents a potential risk, as GPT may reorganise and distil electronic health records in ways that misrepresent clinical reality. Furthermore, many electronic health record systems are poorly designed and contain clinically irrelevant, repetitive, disorganised, or outdated information. This issue highlights the importance of ensuring that GPT is used in a way that complements clinical expertise rather than replaces it.

The legal and ethical considerations surrounding the use of GPT in healthcare are also complex. The authors of a recent essay published in Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) distinguish between using GPT to augment clinician judgement and using it to replace it altogether. The former can provide clinicians with additional information and insights, while the latter poses risks to patient safety and autonomy. Additionally, the direct-to-consumer use of GPT for medical advice raises concerns about the quality of care provided and the impact on the patient-clinician relationship.

As healthcare moves towards a fully electronic health record system, the entire patient history will be accessible to artificial intelligence tools. This means that models that synthesise digital data and generate text could potentially alter any clinical encounter. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the potential benefits and drawbacks of these technologies and use them in a responsible and ethical way.

In conclusion, while there are many potential benefits to using GPT in healthcare, there are also significant challenges that need to be addressed. A thorough understanding of these issues is critical for using GPT in healthcare in a responsible and effective way.",2023-04-29 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-health/news/chatgpt-the-point-care-3307746,2023-05-18 10:30:35,thedailystar
572,Ego-land,"The ego is the master of all conflicts. This is an inflated feeling of pride and superiority over others. It creates a dissection between the ideas of moral and immoral, war and peace, and so on.

Egoists are quick to blame others or raise their voices when anything bad happens. It constantly strives to make people believe that they are not responsible for their actions. They are close-minded, stubborn, and selfish, and try to make people believe they are not responsible for their actions. There may be nothing wrong with feeling important in a regulated manner but problems arise when it affects decision-making or makes the egoist feel superior to others in order to justify his or her behavior. There are three types of egos - parent, adult, and child ego states.

These ego states consist of individual personalities. Each ego state is an entire system of thoughts, feelings, and behaviours from which we interact with one another. Remarkably, three dangers and three types of anxiety are also correlated with these three masters of the ego - moral anxiety (arising from conscience), neurotic anxiety (arising from instincts), and realistic anxiety (arising from the reality principle).

Gaining control of the ego could be one of the best things that one can do to save relationships. It creates misunderstanding and kills kindness and happiness. It is one of the biggest enemies of harmonisation. It's better to feed our soul, not the 'ego'.

573,How to stop emotional eating from stress,"Our relationship with food is complex. On one hand, we need it to survive, but on the other hand, we have found pleasure in our food choices. When we are under stress, we often turn to comfort foods, but the guilt that follows can hinder our efforts to eat healthily. To help break the cycle of stress eating, here are some tips and tricks.

Know what is happening: Stress affects people differently when it comes to eating habits. Some may eat less, while others turn to comfort food or snacks high in fat. However, these choices are often temporary and can lead to unhealthy decisions. It is important to stay mindful of what and why you are eating to make healthier choices.

Keep a food diary: Keep a record of all the food you consume throughout the day, including the time and place of consumption. This food diary is an excellent method for monitoring your dietary habits and trends. Are you snacking excessively between meals? Is food consistently present in your routine? You will be able to assess the healthiness of your food choices and establish goals that can be highly beneficial.

Check if you are really hungry: If you find yourself reaching for snacks shortly after consuming a large meal, take a moment to reflect on whether you are truly hungry, or if your emotions are driving the cravings. In such situations, it may be beneficial to engage in alternative activities such as taking a walk, talking to a friend or drinking some water until the urge subsides. It is also possible that your body may be signalling dehydration, so it is essential to ensure that you are properly hydrated.

Get support: Make sure you have family and friends who can keep you positive and focused in times of stress. It can really help you stick to a healthy lifestyle. Research shows that people with high-stress jobs have better mental health when they have strong support networks.

Focus on your goals: Avoid becoming overly fixated on calorie counts, menu planning, and constantly weighing yourself, as this can distract you from the lifestyle changes you are trying to make. Focusing too much on these details can also lead to more cravings and becoming stuck in a food rut. Instead, be open to trying new foods and experimenting with different ways of preparing your favourite dishes. When you reach a significant goal, celebrate your progress by treating yourself to a healthy reward.

Don't tempt yourself: Remove the urge to snack on unhealthy foods by keeping them out of your home. Stick to a strict grocery list of healthy foods, and never visit the grocery store when you are hungry or in a bad mood.

Make healthy choices: Have an abundant supply of good-for-you nibblers at the ready if you get hungry between meals. Things like fruit, vegetables with a low-fat dip, nuts, or even unbuttered popcorn are perfect.

Don't be so hard on yourself: Don't obsess over your failures. Instead, learn from your mistakes. Do not let one or two missteps create more stress. Instead, focus on the big picture and recognize how you can break your stress-eating cycle.

Meditate: When the urge to eat hits you, try some relaxation techniques. Mindful meditation can ease stress and help fight the impulse that triggers stress eating. Choose a quiet place to sit and observe your thoughts and your breathing.

Work up a sweat: A good workout triggers your body to make chemicals called endorphins that interact with your brain to calm and relax you.

Talk it out: Do not be afraid to discuss your eating habits with your doctor or a mental health professional. They may be able to provide therapy and tips to help you identify what is causing your stress. They can also give you ideas on how to make better food choices and reach your healthy goals.

In conclusion, our ties to food are strong, but by recognising our patterns and habits, surrounding ourselves with positive support, focusing on our goals, and making healthy choices, we can break the cycle of stress eating and achieve a healthier relationship with food.",2023-04-15 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-health/news/how-stop-emotional-eating-stress-3297901,2023-05-18 10:30:37,thedailystar
574,Hearing aids may protect against a higher risk of dementia associated with hearing loss,"A new study published in The Lancet Public Health journal suggests that people with hearing loss who do not use hearing aids may have a higher risk of developing dementia than those without hearing loss. However, the use of hearing aids may reduce this risk to the same level as those without hearing loss.

The research team analysed data from 437,704 participants in the UK Biobank database and found that people with hearing loss who did not use hearing aids had a 42% higher risk of all-cause dementia compared to those with normal hearing. This risk was reduced to the same level as those without hearing loss when hearing aids were used.

The study suggests that hearing loss may be linked to around 8% of worldwide dementia cases, and early introduction of hearing aids when someone starts experiencing hearing impairment is necessary. The researchers also found that the association between hearing aid use and protection from increased dementia was likely mostly due to direct effects from hearing aids rather than indirect causes. Although the study has limitations, the evidence is compelling that treating hearing loss is a promising way of reducing dementia risk, and increasing awareness of and detection of hearing loss, as well as the acceptability and usability of hearing aids, is crucial.",2023-04-15 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-health/news/hearing-aids-may-protect-against-higher-risk-dementia-associated-hearing-loss-3297881,2023-05-18 10:30:38,thedailystar
575,The future is bright for gold-based antibiotics,"Spanish researchers have identified several gold-based compounds with the potential to treat multidrug-resistant bacteria, or ""superbugs"". The compounds were found to be effective against at least one hard-to-treat bacterium, with some proving effective against several.

Drug-resistant infections kill an estimated 700,000 people worldwide each year, and with the figure projected to rise to 10 million by 2050 if no action is taken, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has classified antibiotic resistance as one of the greatest public health threats facing humanity.

The development of new antibiotics has stalled in recent years, with few new treatments being developed, and the compounds identified by the Spanish researchers are seen as a promising new approach. Gold is known to have antibacterial properties, making gold metalloantibiotics – compounds with a gold ion at their core – a potentially exciting new approach to tackling antibiotic resistance.

The researchers studied the activity of 19 gold complexes against a range of multidrug-resistant bacteria isolated from patients. The complexes all belong to the same family but have slightly different structures. The six bacteria studied were Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus Epidermidis, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, Acinetobacter Baumannii, and Escherichia Coli, all of which are multidrug-resistant. Four (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and E. coli) are on the World Health Organisation's list of antibiotic-resistant 'priority pathogens'.

In tests, 16 of the 19 gold complexes were highly effective against MRSA and S. epidermis. Another 16 of the complexes were effective against the other bacteria, all of which are gram-negative. Gram-negative bacteria have greater inbuilt resistance to antibiotics, and the need for new treatments is particularly pressing.

Gold complexes use a variety of techniques to kill bacteria, including stopping enzymes from working, disrupting the function of the bacterial membrane, and damaging DNA. Crucially, this multimodal mechanism should prevent antimicrobial resistance from developing.

The type of gold complexes studied, known as gold (III) complexes, are relatively straightforward and inexpensive to make. They can also be easily modified, providing a vast amount of scope for drug development. The researchers say that the gold-based drugs hold great potential as new antibiotics.

The findings of the study were presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in Copenhagen. Dr Sara M. Soto González, of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, Barcelona, Spain, and colleagues conducted the study.

Dr Soto González concludes: ""All of the gold compounds were effective against at least one of the bacterial species studied and some displayed potent activity against several multidrug-resistant bacteria. It is particularly exciting to see that some of the gold complexes were effective against MRSA and multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, as they are the two biggest causes of hospital-acquired infections."" The researchers say that with research on other types of gold metalloantibiotics also providing promising results, the future is bright for gold-based antibiotics.",2023-04-15 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-health/news/the-future-bright-gold-based-antibiotics-3297886,2023-05-18 10:30:40,thedailystar
576,Uganda introduced life-saving yellow fever vaccine into routine immunisation programme,"In 2022, Uganda was one of 14 countries in Africa reporting confirmed cases of yellow fever. With the support of the Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy and its key partners, including the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a multi-country outbreak response was organised in neighbouring countries that faced more serious yellow fever transmission.

During the Integrated Child Health Days (ICHD) activities in October 2022, despite the ongoing Ebola Virus Disease outbreak having been declared the month before, Uganda maintained its plans to introduce the yellow fever vaccine into its routine immunisation programme.

It is being administered to children aged 9 months, as part of its commitment to the EYE Strategy, with a vaccine introduction grant (VIG) from Gavi. All children will be vaccinated with both yellow fever and measles-rubella vaccines.

The EYE Strategy is a multi-stakeholder partnership that provides support to high-risk countries on how to minimise and eventually end the threat of yellow fever epidemics.

Yellow fever is transmitted by the Aedes Aegypti or Haemagogus mosquito species and outbreaks in Uganda originate mainly from sylvatic, or jungle, transmission. Mosquitoes acquire the virus by feeding on infected primates and then bite humans during agricultural and other activities in forested areas. Humans can then carry the virus to other areas, including urban centres, where it is spread by mosquitoes from human to human.

Yellow fever infections can cause serious illness and, in up to 30–60% of severe cases, death. There are no specific therapeutics to treat the disease, but early supportive care increases survival rates. Crucially, there is a vaccine against yellow fever, and it is safe, highly effective, and only a single dose is needed for life-long protection.

In addition to the success of the roll-out of yellow fever vaccine into its routine immunisation schedule, Uganda will start the implementation of a phased preventive mass vaccination campaign (PMVC) by administering 13 million vaccine doses in 2023, for which Gavi has provided funding through a campaign operations grant. This will target areas deemed most vulnerable to outbreaks.

577,"Sleepless nights understanding the causes, risks, and treatments for insomnia","Insomnia is a widespread sleep disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. The National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults get an average of 7-9 hours of sleep per night, yet research suggests that up to 30% of adults experience some degree of insomnia, with women being more likely to be affected than men.

Individuals with chronic insomnia (defined as difficulty sleeping at least three nights per week for three months or longer) are more likely to develop mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety.

Causes and risks: Insomnia has various causes and can involve psychological, physical, and environmental factors. Stress and anxiety are common triggers of insomnia. Other psychological factors that may contribute to insomnia include depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and bipolar disorder.

Physical health conditions such as chronic pain, respiratory disorders, and neurological conditions can also interfere with sleep, as can certain medications.

Lifestyle habits like irregular sleep schedules, excessive caffeine consumption, and lack of physical activity can also contribute to insomnia. Exposure to electronic devices before bedtime can disrupt sleep.

Treatment: Insomnia can be treated through a combination of behavioural and pharmacological interventions. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a widely used approach that aims to address the underlying causes of insomnia and promote healthy sleep habits.

Medications can be used to treat insomnia, but they have side effects and are not recommended for long-term use.

In recent years, researchers have investigated the potential of non-pharmacological interventions, such as mindfulness-based interventions, yoga, and exercise, as alternative treatments for insomnia.

Lifestyle changes such as avoiding caffeine and alcohol, establishing a regular sleep schedule, and creating a comfortable sleep environment can also be effective in treating insomnia.

Exercise has also been shown to be beneficial for insomnia.

Insomnia is linked with negative outcomes such as impaired cognitive function and increased risk of accidents and injuries. It can also worsen pre-existing medical conditions. Consultation with a healthcare professional is crucial in finding the best treatment for individual cases of insomnia.

578,A dark empath,"Kindness, empathy, and dark empathy are different concepts. Although kindness and empathy both are valued and well-known practices. But, the term 'dark empath' is relatively new. Some described them as ""A wolf in sheep's clothing"". According to some researchers, 'dark empaths' may be even more dangerous than narcissists.

A study has unveiled this personality type that shares similarities with even psychopaths or may prove to be even more dangerous. Dark empaths may be further dangerous as they can control and manipulate others by using their feelings against them. The victim may be left questioning their own feelings, thoughts, and behaviours while believing they are at fault. Dark empaths may also be even harder to identify than a narcissist.

A dark empath can be someone who uses cognitive empathy at the expense of others, often for individual gain. Cognitive empathy is one of three types of empathy outlined by psychologists. By definition, dark empathy is a trait describing someone who understands another's emotions but can not feel them. People with dark empathy could use gaslighting and charm to manipulate the people close to them.

We need to distinctly clarify the differences between empathy and loving kindness - they are two separate notions. Empathy is the ability to understand and relate to another person's feelings, while loving-kindness is an active wish for the well-being of others. Undesirably, for those who have never heard of dark empathy, according to a study, it is more common than we may think. Some suggest that it is related to narcissism as a part of the ""dark triad"" (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy).

The study used results from 16 laboratories across the Netherlands and death and hospital records to produce a more complete picture.

Japanese start-up ispace conceded Wednesday its ambitious attempt to become the first private company to land on the Moon had failed but pledged to move ahead with new missions.

The unmanned Hakuto-R Mission 1 lander had been scheduled to arrive on the Moon's surface overnight but communications were lost during its descent and had still not been reestablished 25 minutes after the scheduled landing.

""It has been determined that there is a high probability that the lander eventually made a hard landing on the Moon's surface,"" ispace said in a statement.

The company said its engineers were working to establish why the landing had failed.

""Although we do not expect to complete the lunar landing at this time, we believe that we have fully accomplished the significance of this mission, having acquired a great deal of data and experience,"" ispace CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada said.

""What is important is to feed this knowledge and learning back to Mission 2 and beyond,"" he said.

Hakamada said the firm is developing two further attempts to land on the lunar surface and the setback would not change that.

Still, the apparent crash marks a frustrating end to a mission that began with the lander's launch last December aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

The vessel was carrying payloads from several countries, including a lunar rover from the United Arab Emirates.

Chief technology officer Ryo Ujiie became emotional as he addressed reporters, describing the attempt as a ""very precious experience"".

Pioneering private space effort

Standing just over two metres (6.5 feet) tall and weighing 340 kilograms (750 pounds), the lander entered lunar orbit last month.

Its descent and landing were fully automated and the craft was supposed to reestablish communication as soon as it touched down.

So far, only the United States, Russia and China have managed to put a spacecraft on the lunar surface, all through government-sponsored programmes.

In April 2019, Israeli organisation SpaceIL watched its lander crash into the Moon's surface.

India's attempt to land a spacecraft on the moon in 2016 also ended in a crash.

Two US companies, Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines, are scheduled to attempt Moon landings later this year.

""We congratulate the ispace inc team on accomplishing a significant number of milestones on their way to today's landing attempt,"" Astrobotic said in a tweet.

""We hope everyone recognises -- today is not the day to shy away from pursuing the lunar frontier, but a chance to learn from adversity and push forward.""

Plans for settling the Moon

Ispace, which listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Growth Market this month, was already planning its next mission before the failure of Hakuto-R.

The spacecraft, whose name refers to the Moon-dwelling white rabbit of Japanese folklore, was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on December 11.

The lander carried several lunar rovers, including a round, baseball-sized robot jointly developed by Japan's space agency and toy manufacturer Takara Tomy, the creator of the Transformer toys.

It also had the 10-kilogram (22-pound) chair-sized Rashid rover developed by the United Arab Emirates and an experimental imaging system from Canadensys Aerospace.

The UAE'S space centre praised ispace for working ""tirelessly"" on the mission and said its team was ""inspired and believes that greater accomplishments are yet to come in our pursuit of space exploration"".

With just 200 employees, ispace has said it ""aims to extend the sphere of human life into space and create a sustainable world by providing high-frequency, low-cost transportation services to the Moon"".

Hakamada touted the mission as laying ""the groundwork for unleashing the Moon's potential and transforming it into a robust and vibrant economic system"".

The firm believes the Moon will support a population of 1,000 people by 2040, with 10,000 more visiting each year.

It plans a second mission, tentatively scheduled for next year, involving both a lunar landing and the deployment of its own rover.",2023-04-26 07:07:50,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/outer-space/news/japan-firm-fails-historic-moon-bid-3304746,2023-05-18 10:30:49,thedailystar

NASA has recently announced the names of the four members who will be joining the latest mission around the Moon on Artemis II. According to NASA, Artemis II will be the debut of a crewed flight since the previous Apollo program, which aims to return astronauts to the surface of the moon.

The crew members for Artemis II are Commander Reid Wiseman, Pilot Victor Glover, Mission Specialist 1 Christina Hammock Koch and Mission Specialist 2 Jeremy Hansen. This makes Christina Hammock Koch the first woman astronaut and Victor Glover the first African-American astronaut to be assigned to an official NASA lunar mission.

As per NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, these four trained astronauts will be representing ""a new generation of star sailors and dreamers - the Artemis Generation"", and pave the way for mankind for further exploration of the Earth's moon. As per official sources, this four-member crew will be flying around the moon in the first crewed moon voyage in over 50 years.

Christina Koch is an electrical engineer who has worked on NASA's first three all-female spacewalks, and was the flight engineer in the NASA space stations for Expeditions 59, 60 and 61.

Victor Glover, an experienced US Navy pilot, was part of NASA's 2013 class of NASA Astronauts and was the pilot for NASA's SpaceX Crew-1 mission.

Jeremy Hansen, the first Canadian chosen for a NASA moon mission, was a fighter pilot before joining the Canadian Space Agency. He currently works with NASA on training astronauts.

Reid Wiseman, also a former US Navy pilot, previously lived and worked abroad at the NASA International Space Station as a flight engineer in 2014. He had previous experience in commanding research missions and has served as Chief of the NASA Astronauts.

Artemis II, which will voyage around the moon, is scheduled to launch in late 2024. The mission following that, Artemis III, where the crewed mission will land on the moon, is currently set for 2025.",2023-04-04 08:15:45,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/nasa-announces-the-first-woman-and-first-african-american-astronaut-manned-moon-mission-3288486,2023-05-18 10:30:51,thedailystar
585,First 3D-printed rocket lifts off but fails to reach orbit,"This handout screengrab provided by Relativity Space on March 22, 2023, shows the third launch attempt of the first 3D printed rocket, Terran 1, from Launch Complex 16 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Photo: Reuters

The world's first 3D-printed rocket launched successfully on Wednesday, marking a step forward for the California company behind the innovative spacecraft, though it failed to reach orbit.

Billed as less costly to produce and fly, the unmanned Terran 1 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida at 11:25 pm (0325 GMT Thursday) but suffered an ""anomaly"" during second-stage separation as it streamed towards low Earth orbit, according to a livestream broadcast by aerospace startup Relativity Space.

The company did not immediately give further details.

While it failed to reach orbit, Wednesday's launch proved that the rocket -- whose mass is 85 percent 3D-printed -- could withstand the rigors of lift-off.

The successful launch came on the third attempt. It had originally been scheduled to launch on March 8 but was postponed at the last minute because of propellant temperature issues.

A second attempt on March 11 was scrubbed due to fuel pressure problems.

Had Terran 1 reached low Earth orbit, it would have been the first privately funded vehicle using methane fuel to do so on its first try, according to Relativity.

Terran 1 was not carrying a payload for its first flight, but the rocket will eventually be capable of putting up to 2,755 pounds (1,250 kilograms) into low Earth orbit.

The rocket is 110 feet (33.5 meters) tall with a diameter of 7.5 feet (2.2 meters).

Eighty-five percent of its mass is 3D-printed with metal alloys, including the nine Aeon 1 engines used in its first stage and the one Aeon Vacuum engine employed in the second.

It is the largest ever 3D-printed object and was made using the world's largest 3D metal printers, according to the Long Beach-based company.

BUILT IN 60 DAYS

Relativity's goal is to produce a rocket that is 95 percent 3D-printed.

Terran 1 is powered by engines using liquid oxygen and liquid natural gas -- the ""propellants of the future,"" capable of eventually fueling a voyage to Mars, Relativity says.

SpaceX's Starship and Vulcan rockets being developed by United Launch Alliance use the same fuel.

Relativity is also building a larger rocket, the Terran R, capable of putting a payload of 44,000 pounds (20,000 kg) into low Earth orbit.

The first launch of a Terran R, which is designed to be fully reusable, is scheduled for next year.

A satellite operator can wait for years for a spot on an Arianespace or SpaceX rocket, and Relativity Space hopes to accelerate the timeline with its 3D-printed rockets.

Relativity said its 3D-printed versions use 100 times fewer parts than traditional rockets and can be built from raw materials in just 60 days.

Relativity has signed commercial launch contracts worth $1.65 billion, mostly for the Terran R, according to CEO Tim Ellis, who co-founded the company in 2015.",2023-03-23 04:59:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/outer-space/news/first-3d-printed-rocket-lifts-fails-reach-orbit-3278611,2023-05-18 10:30:52,thedailystar

A Russian spacecraft on a mission to bring back to Earth a crew stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) has docked at the station, Russian space agency Roscosmos said early on Sunday.

The Soyuz MS-23, which lifted off from Baikonour space centre in Kazakhstan on Friday, is to bring back Russian cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitry Petelin, and US astronaut Francisco Rubio in September.

The three had been due to end their mission in March. They were left stuck in space after the cooling system of their Soyuz MS-22 capsule started leaking two months ago. The Soyuz MS-22 ship is now to be brought back unmanned next month.

""Today at 03:58 Moscow time (00:58 GMT), the Soyuz MS-23 unmanned spacecraft docked to the Poisk module of the International Space Station in automatic mode,"" Roscosmos said on the Telegram messaging platform.

The Poisk module is a docking module at the ISS.

Yuri Borisov, chief executive of Roscosmos, said that the next space walk of the Russian cosmonauts at the station will take place in April or May.

The Soyuz MS-23 ship carried 429 kilograms (946 lb) of additional cargo to the station, needed to extend the astronauts' mission, Russian agencies reported.",2023-02-26 06:00:20,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/outer-space/news/russian-soyuz-spacecraft-docks-iss-bring-back-stranded-crew-3257626,2023-05-18 10:30:55,thedailystar
588,Saudi Arabia to send its first woman into space,"Saudi Arabia will send its first ever woman astronaut on a space mission later this year, state media has reported, in the latest move to revamp the kingdom's ultra-conservative image.

Rayyana Barnawi will join fellow Saudi male astronaut Ali Al-Qarni on a mission to the International Space Station (ISS) ""during the second quarter of 2023"", the official Saudi Press Agency said on Sunday.

The astronauts ""will join the crew of the AX-2 space mission"" and the space flight will ""launch from the USA"", the agency said.

The oil-rich country will be following in the footsteps of the neighbouring United Arab Emirates which in 2019 became the first Arab country to send one of its citizens into space.

At the time, astronaut Hazzaa al-Mansoori spent eight days on the ISS. Another fellow Emirati, Sultan al-Neyadi, will also make a voyage later this month.

Nicknamed the ""Sultan of Space"", 41-year-old Neyadi will become the first Arab astronaut to spend six months in space when he blasts off for the ISS aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

589,Hubble captures mysterious ‘spokes’ gliding across Saturn’s rings,"The Hubble Space Telescope has recently captured images of a mysterious show playing out on Saturn's rings —fleeting ""spokes"" that appear to move along the planet's rings.

Scientists cannot yet explain why the phenomena happen, reports CNN.

The return of the spokes is one of the earliest signs that Saturn is entering a new season as it approaches the autumnal equinox of its northern hemisphere, which is expected to occur on May 6, 2025, for the first time in about 15 years.

Scientists have long known about the perplexing spokes, which look like apparitions skating along Saturn's rings and can be seen around the planet during equinox time.

The first evidence was captured by NASA's Voyager mission in the 1980s, adds CNN.

Exactly what causes the events still eludes scientists. But this time around, NASA researchers are hoping to finally solve the mystery.

Hubble will continue observing the spokes, which are expected to grow more prominent in the lead-up to the 2025 equinox, providing more data about the intriguing occurrences.

""The suspected culprit for the spokes is the planet's variable magnetic field,"" according to a NASA news release. ""Planetary magnetic fields interact with the solar wind, creating an electrically charged environment.

""On Earth, when those charged particles hit the atmosphere this is visible in the northern hemisphere as the aurora borealis, or northern lights.""

Essentially, scientists suspect that tiny particles can become charged by this activity, causing them to briefly rise up higher than surrounding material and creating an apparent bulge.

Scientists hope that forthcoming Hubble data will prove or disprove that theory once and for all, building on observations collected by Voyager and Cassini, the dedicated Saturn probe that observed the spoke phenomena during its last appearance in the late 2000s.

""Despite years of excellent observations by the Cassini mission, the precise beginning and duration of the spoke season is still unpredictable, rather like predicting the first storm during hurricane season,"" said Amy Simon, a senior planetary scientist at NASA who heads the Hubble Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy program, in a statement.

The spokes are only visible around Saturn's equinox when the planet's rings are tilted toward the sun, according to NASA. The markings can appear as bright spots of light or as black splotches, depending on the vantage point of the viewing instrument.

It's possible other planets with rings experience similar events, though they've so far only been observed on Saturn's densely packed and very prominent rings.

""It's a fascinating magic trick of nature we only see on Saturn — for now at least,"" Simon said.",2023-02-13 12:42:08,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/outer-space/news/hubble-captures-mysterious-spokes-gliding-across-saturns-rings-3246696,2023-05-18 10:30:57,thedailystar
590,Truck-sized asteroid misses Earth,"A truck-sized asteroid that suddenly loomed out of the darkness a few days ago -- with the Earth in its sights -- sailed harmlessly past us on Thursday, space scientists said.

Despite what we've seen in movies like ""Armageddon,"" no global mission to blow it up or knock it off course with nuclear weapons was required.

Instead, Asteroid 2023 BU whizzed past without incident and back out into the blackness of space.

Phew.

The rock, which was spotted for the first time on Saturday by an amateur stargazer in Crimea, came closest to the southern tip of South America at around 0029 GMT Friday, according to scientists who were tracking it.

At its nearest point, the asteroid was just 2,200 miles (3,600 kilometers) from Earth's surface -- just a quarter of the height of many of the geostationary satellites that make our telephones and car navigation systems work.

Amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov, who had already spotted an interstellar comet in 2019, raised the alarm over the weekend, alerting fellow space-watchers to the previously unknown celestial body.

Scientists around the world raced to calculate where it was headed -- and whether we needed to start making last-minute evacuation plans.

But experts using NASA's Scout impact hazard assessment system rapidly determined the alien visitor was coming in peace.

""Scout quickly ruled out 2023 BU as an impactor, but despite the very few observations, it was nonetheless able to predict that the asteroid would make an extraordinarily close approach with Earth,"" said NASA's Davide Farnocchia, who helped develop Scout.

""In fact, this is one of the closest approaches by a known near-Earth object ever recorded.""

If the math had been off, however, humanity would still probably have been alright, scientists say.

At between just 3.5 to 8.5 meters (11 to 28 feet) across, Asteroid 2023 BU is a bit small to cause too much damage, and would have largely burned up as it hurtled through the atmosphere.

The few meteorites that did make it to the ground would have been small, not the city-destroying, tsunami-generating monsters of ""Deep Impact.""

The close call will leave a more lasting impact on the asteroid itself, NASA's number-crunchers said.

Earth's gravity will affect the object's orbit, lengthening the amount of time it takes for 2023 BU to go around the Sun, from 359 days to a more leisurely 425 days.",2023-01-27 06:27:14,https://www.thedailystar.net/top-news/news/truck-sized-asteroid-misses-earth-3231996,2023-05-18 10:30:59,thedailystar

Photo: Reuters

The CEO of OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT, told a Senate panel on Tuesday the use of artificial intelligence to interfere with election integrity is a ""significant area of concern"", adding that it needs regulation.

""I am nervous about it,"" CEO Sam Altman said about elections and AI, adding rules and guidelines are needed.

For months, companies large and small have raced to bring increasingly versatile AI to market, throwing endless data and billions of dollars at the challenge. Some critics fear the technology will exacerbate societal harms, among them prejudice and misinformation, while others warn AI could end humanity itself.

""There's no way to put this genie in the bottle. Globally, this is exploding,"" said Senator Cory Booker, one of many lawmakers with questions about how best to regulate AI.

Senator Mazie Hirono noted the danger of misinformation as the 2024 election nears. ""In the election context, for example, I saw a picture of former President Trump being arrested by NYPD and that went viral,"" she said, pressing Altman on whether he would consider the faked image harmful.

Altman responded that creators should make clear when an image is generated rather than factual.

Speaking before Congress for the first time, Altman suggested that, in general, the U.S. should consider licensing and testing requirements for development of AI models.

Altman, asked to opine on which AI should be subject to licensing, said a model that can persuade or manipulate a person's beliefs would be an example of a ""great threshold.""

He also said companies should have the right to say they do not want their data used for AI training, which is one idea being discussed on Capitol Hill. Altman said, however, that material on the public web would be fair game.

Altman also said he ""wouldn't say never"" to the idea of advertising but preferred a subscription-based model.

The White House has convened top technology CEOs including Altman to address AI. U.S. lawmakers likewise are seeking action to further the technology's benefits and national security while limiting its misuse. Consensus is far from certain.

An OpenAI staffer recently proposed the creation of a U.S. licensing agency for AI, which could be called the Office for AI Safety and Infrastructure Security, or OASIS, Reuters has reported.

OpenAI is backed by Microsoft Corp MSFT.O. Altman is also calling for global cooperation on AI and incentives for safety compliance.

592,Ex-NBCUniversal ad chief Linda Yaccarino named new Twitter CEO,"Elon Musk has named former NBCUniversal advertising chief Linda Yaccarino as Twitter's new CEO, as the company tries to reverse a plunge in ad revenue.

Yaccarino will take over a social media platform beset with challenges and a heavy debt load, after she spent several years modernizing the advertising business at NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast Corp.

""I am excited to welcome Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of Twitter!"" Musk said in a tweet on Friday. ""@LindaYacc will focus primarily on business operations, while I focus on product design & new technology.""

Since Musk acquired Twitter in October, advertisers have fled the social media platform, worried that their ads could appear next to inappropriate content after the company lost nearly 80% of staff. Musk earlier this year acknowledged that Twitter suffered a massive decline in ad revenue.

Twitter's ""trajectory will immediately take a 180-degree turn"" under her leadership, said Lou Paskalis, a longtime ad industry executive and CEO of AJL Advisory, a marketing consultancy.

""I think (Yaccarino) has climbed every mountain she could at NBCU and did it impeccably well. And there's no greater challenge than restoring order at Twitter,"" he said.

While Musk said Yaccarino would help build an ""everything app,"" which he has previously said could offer a variety of services such as peer-to-peer payments, his selection of an advertising veteran signaled that digital ads would continue to be a core focus of the business.

Musk has axed thousands of Twitter employees, rushed the launch of a subscription product that allowed scammers to impersonate major brands and suspended users with whom he disagreed, all of which have spooked brands from spending on the platform.

In order to diversify away from ads, the billionaire has focused on Twitter Blue, a subscription feature that costs users $8 per month to verify their accounts, but the product has had limited success.

Independent researcher Travis Brown, who has been tracking the number of Twitter Blue subscribers over time, estimated there were 619,858 customers as of April 30.

Yaccarino could not be reached for comment.

BLOW TO NBCUNIVERSAL

Her exit is another big hit to NBCUniversal. Last month, NBC parent Comcast said NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell was leaving after acknowledging an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, following a complaint that prompted an investigation.

Advertising President Mark Marshall will step in as interim chairman of NBCUniversal's advertising and partnerships group. Marshall was named president of ad sales and partnerships in 2018, overseeing NBC's broadcast entertainment, sports and advanced advertising sales.

Yaccarino's exit comes at a difficult time for NBCUniversal, which is preparing for its annual presentation to advertisers on Monday at Radio City Music Hall.

Yaccarino joined NBCU in 2011, after 15 years at Turner Entertainment, and has been credited with taking the network's ad sales operation into the digital era.

As broadcast television audiences migrated to streaming, she took to the stage at Radio City Music Hall last year to tell advertisers their brand messages were not an afterthought. She said NBCUniversal incorporated ads in its Peacock streaming service from the outset.

""Twitter needs credibility with the advertising community,"" said Greg Kahn, chief executive of GK Digital Ventures media consultancy. ""Linda has demonstrated her trust, her innovative nature of bringing new partners to the table and a deep bench of relationships.""

Musk, the CEO of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc, completed his purchase of Twitter in October for $44 billion. He said in December that he would step aside as CEO once he found ""someone foolish enough to take the job.""

On Thursday, Musk tweeted that he had found a CEO without identifying Yaccarino. One person close to Yaccarino said Musk's tweet may well have accelerated the timetable for her to join Twitter, which would be a balm to Tesla shareholders.

""So you can talk to people anywhere in the world without giving them your phone number.""

In a subsequent comment fired off on Twitter, Musk contended that the WhatsApp messaging service operated by Meta ""cannot be trusted.""

A messaging feature at Twitter would compete with an array of free services including Messenger, Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp.

Musk added that Twitter on Wednesday will start encrypting direct messages on the platform, scrambling contents to safeguard privacy.

Since buying Twitter for $44 billion late last year, Musk has implemented changes in seemingly impulsive ways, sometimes causing chaos for users.

594,"Musk threatens to reassign NPR Twitter account, NPR says","Twitter chief Elon Musk has ""threatened"" to reassign National Public Radio's Twitter account to another company, the U.S.-based broadcaster said on Tuesday.

Musk suggested that he would reassign the network's main account, under the @NPR handle, to another organization or person, NPR said.

NPR stopped posting content to its 52 official Twitter feeds last month in protest against a Twitter designation that implied government involvement in its editorial content.

Musk, in an email to an NPR reporter, asked about its engagement with Twitter, the public broadcaster said.

""So is NPR going to start posting on Twitter again, or should we reassign @NPR to another company?"" NPR quoted Musk as saying.

""Our policy is to recycle handles that are definitively dormant,"" he said in another email. ""Same policy applies to all accounts. No special treatment for NPR.""

NPR and Twitter did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment.

According to Twitter's policy, users should log in to their account at least once every 30 days to avoid permanent removal due to prolonged inactivity.

PBS and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation followed NPR and stopped posting on Twitter following similar labeling.

595,UK blocks Microsoft's $69bn bid for 'Call of Duty' games giant,"Activision Blizzard makes hit games like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. Photo: Reuters

Britain on Wednesday blocked Microsoft's $69-billion takeover of ""Call of Duty"" video games giant Activision Blizzard, arguing it would harm competition in cloud gaming.

The ruling will be appealed by both US companies -- but analysts warned it could spell game over for the gigantic takeover of Activision, whose hit titles also include ""Candy Crush"" and ""World of Warcraft"".

Xbox-owner Microsoft launched its audacious bid for Activision in early 2022 to create the world's third biggest gaming firm by revenue after China's Tencent and Japan's PlayStation maker Sony, triggering antitrust concerns.

Following its lengthy probe, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority announced Wednesday it has prevented the deal ""over concerns... (it) would alter the future of the fast-growing cloud gaming market, leading to reduced innovation and less choice for UK gamers over the years to come"".

Both firms said they will appeal and expressed deep disappointment over Britain's decision regarding the gigantic takeover.

Activision threatened to reassess its growth plans for Britain amid chances that the deal could now be blocked elsewhere, although it has been approved in Japan.

- 'Game over?' -

""If the competition appeal tribunal (in Britain) confirms the decision, it's Game Over for Microsoft,"" said Anne Witt, a professor of anti-trust law at EDHEC business school in France.

""If Microsoft is in the UK market, it has to abide by the rules. It's the price you pay to be a global player,"" she told AFP.

Microsoft is seeking to further tap into booming demand for cloud services that stream gameplay over a range of devices like mobile phones and tablets.

But it already accounts for between 60 percent and 70 percent of cloud gaming services, according to a CMA analysis.

""The deal would reinforce Microsoft's advantage in the market by giving it control over important gaming content such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft,"" it said.

""The evidence available to the CMA indicates that, absent the merger, Activision would start providing games via cloud platforms in the foreseeable future.""

In addition, the CMA said Microsoft's proposed remedies over cloud gaming contained ""significant shortcomings"" and would require further regulatory oversight instead of allowing the market to decide and the industry to shape its own future.

""Preventing the merger would effectively allow market forces to continue to operate and shape the development of cloud gaming without this regulatory intervention,"" it added in the statement.

Martin Coleman, chair of the independent panel of experts conducting the CMA probe, said the transaction would hand Microsoft even more power over rivals.

""Microsoft already enjoys a powerful position and head start over other competitors in cloud gaming and this deal would strengthen that advantage, giving it the ability to undermine new and innovative competitors,"" Coleman said.

In response, Microsoft's vice chair and president Brad Smith said it remained ""fully committed to this acquisition and will appeal"".

The decision ""rejects a pragmatic path to address competition concerns and discourages technology innovation and investment in the United Kingdom"".

- UK 'closed for business'? -

Activision also slammed the regulator's verdict, arguing it showed Britain was ""closed for business"" for its industry, despite the UK government's insistence that it was a global hub for technology.

""We will work aggressively with Microsoft to reverse this on appeal,"" it said.

""The report's conclusions are a disservice to UK citizens, who face increasingly dire economic prospects.""

Wednesday's announcement comes despite the CMA having recently narrowed the scope of its probe to cloud gaming, after recently concluding that Microsoft's deal would not damage competition in relation to console gaming.

In Wall Street trade on Wednesday, Microsoft's shares rallied seven percent on investor relief, although the stock also won a boost from quarterly results that beat expectations with $18.3 billion in profit thanks to a strong performance in cloud activities.

Activision's share price however sank nine percent in value.

The European Union is meanwhile due to announce its ruling on the blockbuster deal by May 22.

The US Federal Trade Commission last year filed a suit to block the takeover, alleging that Microsoft had previously acquired smaller gaming companies to take the games exclusive.

596,"Netflix subscribers at record high, password crackdown coming","Netflix on Tuesday said that its number of subscribers hit a record high 232.5 million in the first quarter of the year and that its nascent ad-supported tier was faring well.

The streaming television giant reported a quarterly profit of $1.3 billion, in line with expectations, but said it had delayed a broad crackdown on sharing of account passwords ""to improve the experience for members.""

Netflix said it expects to begin rolling out its options for paid password sharing this quarter instead.

""It's clear that the company wants to manage any fallout from the new strategy,"" said Third Bridge analyst Jamie Lumley.

That means some membership and revenue benefits resulting from the move were postponed, Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.

Netflix has dabbled with ""borrower"" or ""shared"" accounts in a few markets, but plans to roll them out in the United States and elsewhere this month, co-chief executive Greg Peters said in a streamed earnings interview.

Netflix said it is taking time to make sure subscribers have seamless access to the service away from home or on various devices such as tablets, TVs or smartphones.

""We learned from this last set of launches about some improvements we can do,"" Peters said.

""It was better to take a little bit of extra time to incorporate those learnings and make this transition as smooth as possible for members.""

And while a new ad-subsidized subscription tier at Netflix is in its early days, engagement is above initial expectations and Netflix has seen ""very little switching from our standard and premium plans.""

Market tracker Insider Intelligence forecast that Netflix will bring in $770 million in ad revenue from the new tier this year, and that revenue figure will top $1 billion next year.

As growth at Netflix cooled last year, the Silicon Valley based streaming company focused on creating a lower priced subscription tier with advertising.

Netflix also set out to nudge people watching for free with shared passwords to begin paying for the service without alienating subscribers.

""This account sharing initiative helps us have a larger base of potential paying members and grow Netflix long term,"" said co-chief executive Ted Sarandos.

- Future of TV -

For the first time ever, US adults will spend more time this year watching digital video on platforms such as Netflix, TikTok and YouTube than viewing traditional television, Insider Intelligence has forecast.

The market tracker expects ""linear TV"" to account for less than half of daily viewing for the first time ever.

""This milestone is driven by people spending more and more time watching video on their biggest and smallest screens, whether it's an immersive drama on a connected TV or a viral clip on a smartphone,"" Insider Intelligence principal analyst Paul Verna said in a release.

Netflix and YouTube are ""neck and neck"" leaders when it comes to digital video audience attention, according to Insider Intelligence.

Netflix planned to continue spending about $17 billion annually on shows and films, with that amount perhaps climbing after next year.

""Netflix subscriber growth shows that the streaming wars are still on,"" said analyst Lumley.

He criticised Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the firm behind chatbot sensation ChatGPT, of ""training the AI to lie"" and said OpenAI has now become a ""closed source"", ""for-profit"" organisation ""closely allied with Microsoft"".

He also accused Larry Page, co-founder of Google, of not taking AI safety seriously.

""I'm going to start something which I call 'TruthGPT', or a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe,"" Musk said in an interview with Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson aired on Monday.

He said TruthGPT ""might be the best path to safety"" that would be ""unlikely to annihilate humans"".

""It's simply starting late. But I will try to create a third option,"" Musk said.

Musk, OpenAI, Microsoft and Page did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Musk has been poaching AI researchers from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to launch a startup to rival OpenAI, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Musk last month registered a firm named X.AI Corp, incorporated in Nevada, according to a state filing. The firm listed Musk as the sole director and Jared Birchall, the managing director of Musk's family office, as a secretary.

'CIVILIZATIONAL DESTRUCTION'

The move came even after Musk and a group of artificial intelligence experts and industry executives called for a six-month pause in developing systems more powerful than OpenAI's newly launched GPT-4, citing potential risks to society.

Musk also reiterated his warnings about AI during the interview with Carlson, saying ""AI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance or bad car production"" according to the excerpts.

""It has the potential of civilizational destruction,"" he said.

He said, for example, that a super intelligent AI can write incredibly well and potentially manipulate public opinions.

He tweeted over the weekend that he had met with former U.S. President Barack Obama when he was president and told him that Washington needed to ""encourage AI regulation"".

Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but he stepped down from the company's board in 2018. In 2019, he tweeted that he left OpenAI because he had to focus on Tesla and SpaceX.

He also tweeted at that time that other reasons for his departure from OpenAI were, ""Tesla was competing for some of the same people as OpenAI & I didn't agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do.""

Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has also become CEO of Twitter, a social media platform he bought for $44 billion last year.

In the interview with Fox News, Musk said he recently valued Twitter at ""less than half"" of the acquisition price.

In January, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) announced a further multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI, intensifying competition with rival Google and fueling the race to attract AI funding in Silicon Valley.",2023-04-18 02:12:36,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/science-gadgets-and-tech/tech-news/news/elon-musk-start-rival-microsoft-backed-chatgpt-3299726,2023-05-18 10:31:07,thedailystar
598,How to build a well-planned city: lessons from Singapore,"Singapore is one of the most sought-after locations in the world to live and work due to its impeccable urban planning, which has earned it a reputation as a model city. The city-state has worked incredibly hard over the years to improve the quality of life for its people through thoughtful and pro-active planning initiatives.

The city-state, which became independent from Malaysia in 1965, has repeatedly placed highly in international indices for economic competitiveness, education, healthcare, and quality of life. But this achievement did not materialise overnight.

When Singapore's leaders realised they needed to create a detailed plan to modernise the city and enhance the lives of its residents, the transformation of the city-state began. The government wanted to build a city that could compete with other global cities and be clean, green, and efficient.

The public housing programme in Singapore is among the city-most state's impressive features. Public housing units that are well-designed and conveniently located are available to millions of people because the government has prioritised affordable housing. Singapore has been able to significantly reduce homelessness and raise living standards for the vast majority of its citizens thanks to this programme.

The city-state has made significant investments in infrastructure for transportation as well as housing, making it one of the most effective and practical public transportation systems in the entire world. Singaporeans can move around the city quickly and easily thanks to the extensive network of buses, trains, and ferries, which is complemented by the well-designed road network.

Singapore's dedication to green spaces is another distinguishing feature of its urban planning. Singapore has a lot of greenery and open spaces, including nature reserves, parks, and gardens, despite being a very populated city. These green areas not only improve the aesthetics of the city but also offer recreational opportunities and environmental advantages like cooler urban temperatures and cleaner air.

Singapore has also given considerable attention to urban planning and architecture, resulting in a beautiful cityscape that reflects its culture and past. Numerous colonial structures have been preserved by the city-state, which has also incorporated contemporary building styles into its urban environment.

Finally, Singapore's urban planning focuses on economic growth and job creation in addition to physical infrastructure. A thriving economy and high employment rates are the results of the government's business- and foreign-investment-attractive policies. In order to develop a skilled workforce that can compete in the global economy, the city-state has also made significant investments in education and training.

Although Singapore's urban planning has received high praise, there are still some difficulties. The city-state must make ongoing efforts to address issues like income inequality, an ageing population, and environmental sustainability.

However, Singapore's achievement in creating a well-planned city is a testament to the effectiveness of urban planning and emphasises the significance of funding public services and infrastructure. The city state's experience with urban planning provides invaluable lessons for other cities around the globe working to create livable and sustainable urban environments as it continues to develop and change.",2023-04-11 11:50:26,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/how-build-well-planned-city-lessons-singapore-3294556,2023-05-18 10:31:08,thedailystar

602,For the love of the country and its people,"In conversation with Rashed Mujib Noman, Country Director, Augmedix Bangladesh

For our readers out there, can you tell us who exactly Mr Rashed Mujib Noman is? How has your upbringing shaped the way you see the world?

I was born in Dhaka's Shahjahanpur area to a middle-class family. My father was an EPCS (East Pakistan Civil Service) officer. As my father was a government employee, he would often be transferred to different parts of the country. Therefore, I had the opportunity to live in and experience quite a few districts with my family. My uncle was my inspiration during my childhood, and as he was a doctor, I wanted to follow in his footsteps. As a result, I got into Mymensingh Medical College. However, I felt homesick and felt that understanding topics came to me naturally rather than memorisation. So, I ended up studying engineering at one of the most prestigious universities in the country, BUET.

While I completed my HSC in 1990, I had to wait two years before classes commenced due to the ongoing protests. I taught students for 12-14 hours daily during those two years, utilising my mathematics and physics knowledge.

You have studied in some of the most renowned educational institutes in Bangladesh and the US in both engineering and business. Can you tell us about your learnings from these institutes? How was your experience working in global companies like General Motors and Boeing?

During my university days, I aspired to become a faculty of this renowned institution and strived to attain the best grades. But soon enough, I realised I was missing out on the enjoyable parts of campus life. That's when I started to balance my studying with partaking in extracurricular activities.

I had a knack for identifying business early on and wanted to pursue a business during my undergrad days. I had a boutique business during those days, and I connected with a few seniors in BUET who used to work in the garments industry to improve my business. While studying at BUET, I pursued an MBA from IBA, Dhaka University and followed through on my decision.

However, my parents wanted me to pursue my higher education abroad, so I joined the University of South Carolina to complete my Masters in Mechanical Engineering. After completing my Masters, my parents and professor wanted me to pursue a PhD.

However, I wanted to work for a couple of years and joined General Motors, where I worked successfully for over six years. Meanwhile, I also completed my MBA from the New York Institute of Technology.

Afterwards, I joined Boeing in a managerial role. I'm particularly grateful to my first-line manager at Boeing, who showed me the ropes from day one and empowered me to become the best version of myself. She saw my interest in talking to people and enabled me to explore other avenues of the company. I worked closely with different departments, including supply chain management and core engineering work.

What compelled you to return to Bangladesh?

I was thrilled to work in such a dynamic organisation and was looking forward to becoming the next Bangladeshi director in the Boeing company. However, during this time, I realised that my parents were growing old, and I had to be there with them. After all, family comes first. So, I started looking for job opportunities in Bangladesh. That's when I noticed that Augmedix Bangladesh was looking for a Country Director in Bangladesh.

You started your journey with Augmedix in mid-2017. Can you tell us about your experience as the Country Director of Augmedix Bangladesh?

I took the leap of faith and joined Augmedix Bangladesh as its Country Director in August 2017. While my decision was influenced by my will to be with my family, I also felt indebted towards my country. I wanted to give back to my country with the knowledge and expertise that I had accumulated over a decade and a half. Moreover, the timing was perfect for me to return to Bangladesh, despite leaving behind such a lucrative career in the US. I believe I made the right decision by coming back.

Regarding Augmedix, I will say that I will choose to stay with Augmedix and help it grow in the next few years. I want to help achieve the 2 thousand by 2025 goal where we collectively work together and achieve our goals with the magical performance from our energetic team. I'm delighted to see how our team members take ownership of their work to drive the company forward. The scribes of Augmedix are at the heart of our business. This year, we aim to recruit more people and increase our team to 1,000. Our team believes it's possible and works day and night to make it happen. Moreover, we will also be moving to a new office later this year to continue our operational expansion.

What are some projects that you have worked on recently?

I have been actively involved in several projects with the ICT Division and many educational institutions. I was involved in developing some course curricula for various educational institutions and thoroughly enjoyed working with some of the brightest minds in the country.

I have also spent a fair amount of time working with some of the country's leading startup founders and mentoring them during their early stages. I believe that more Bangladeshi startups can flourish with the right guidance and exposure.

What is your approach towards managing your team?

Everyone has a different approach in terms of management. I believe in having a collaborative and inclusive approach. I believe there should be a feedback system that allows everyone to share their thoughts before making any decision. Having an open culture allows me to connect with all members of the Augmedix team and understand their pain points closely. Moreover, having empowered managers who take ownership of the day-to-day operations allows me to think more strategically for the company's overall growth.

You won the prestigious Digital Bangladesh Award for ICT Industrial Development last year. What are your thoughts on that?

I had no expectations of getting the prestigious Digital Bangladesh Award. So the call from the ICT Division came as a surprise to me. Eventually, the ICT State Minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak and Deputy Education Minister Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury Nowfel congratulated me. They acknowledged my contribution to the educational and ICT development of the country. To get a national award from the Prime Minister is an honour. I am truly blessed to receive this award.

What do you think about the young generation of the country?

I believe the young generation is the future of our country. With the right guidance and opportunities, I believe they can make great strides in the job market locally and globally. I believe the parents can become more involved in their children's upbringing and play a vital role in enabling them to realise their potential and become future-ready in a competitive global job market.

604,Musk says new Twitter chief has been hired,"‘She will be starting in 6 weeks’

An image of Elon Musk is seen on smartphone placed on printed Twitter logos in this picture illustration taken April 28, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo

Elon Musk has said he has found a new chief executive for Twitter, but did not name the person, while the Wall Street Journal reported that Comcast CMCSA.O NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino was in talks for the job.

Musk said in a tweet yesterday: ""Excited to announce that I've hired a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks!""

Musk said he will transition to the role of chief technology officer of the social media platform within the next few weeks.

Musk, who took over as CEO of Twitter when he completed his $44 billion purchase of the company in October, said in December that he would step aside as CEO once he found ""someone foolish enough to take the job."" He said that he would then run Twitter's software and servers teams.

The WSJ cited people familiar with the situation in saying that Yaccarino was in talks for the top post.

Reuters reported after Musk's tweet that Yaccarino could be his choice to lead Twitter, according to a Silicon Valley executive and a former Hollywood executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Yaccarino, the top advertising sales executive at NBCUniversal, interviewed Musk at an advertising conference in Miami last month.

At the conference, Yaccarino encouraged the audience to welcome Musk with applause and lauded his work ethic.

""Many of you in this room know me, and you know I pride myself on my work ethic,"" she said, adding, ""Buddy, I met my match.""

Yaccarino joined NBCU in 2011, after 15 years at Turner Entertainment and has been credited with dragging the network's ad sales operation into the digital future.

As broadcast television audiences migrated to streaming, she took to the stage at Radio City Music Hall last year to tell advertisers that their brand messages were not an afterthought.

Yaccarino did not respond to calls seeking comment on Thursday.

When asked for comment, an NBCUniversal spokesperson said, ""Linda is in back-to-back rehearsals for the Upfront,"" referring to a presentation NBCUniversal will host for advertisers in New York on Monday.

Yaccarino's exit would be another big blow to the company after Comcast said last month that NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell was leaving after acknowledging an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company, following a complaint that prompted an investigation.

""ANCHOR IS LOOSENED""

Musk has previously not named any prospective candidates.

Speculation was rife on Thursday among tech and media insiders and on Blind, an anonymous messaging app for tech employees.

Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and a top executive at Musk's brain-chip startup Neuralink, Shivon Zilis, were among names that were being discussed.

Musk, who has come under fire from investors in his Tesla TSLA.O electric car company as being distracted by his attention to Twitter, said he will transition to the role of Twitter's executive chair, along with the role of CTO, overseeing product, software and system operations.

Musk's post about a new Twitter CEO came about 15 minutes before the close of Wall Street on Thursday, and Tesla shares closed 2% higher. The shares rose a further 1.6% in after-hours trade.

""The boat anchor called Twitter is loosened from Musk's ankle. Now he can get back to spending more time creating value at Tesla,"" said Craig Irwin, analyst at Roth MKM.

Musk has long said he intended to find a new leader for Twitter.

In a Twitter poll started by Musk in December, 57.5% users voted for him to step down as CEO of the social media platform.

The billionaire's first two weeks as Twitter's owner in October were marked by rapid change. He quickly fired Twitter's previous CEO, Parag Agrawal, and other senior leaders, and then laid off half its staff in November.

Musk, a self-proclaimed ""free speech absolutist,"" has said he took over Twitter to prevent the platform from becoming an echo chamber for hate and division.

He also said he would ""defeat"" spam bots on the platform, a key area of his tussle with Twitter's board over his back and forth on the buyout of the company.

He said last month that Twitter was ""roughly breaking even.""",2023-05-12 05:39:32,https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/musk-says-new-twitter-chief-has-been-hired-3317746,2023-05-18 10:31:16,thedailystar

616,Sudeshna Sanyal: The Indian singer who calls Bangladesh ‘Maa’,"Sudeshna Sanyal Rudra is a Rabindra Sangeet singer, who is also a dancer as well as a priest. She has a deep connection with Dhaka, usually calling Bangladesh her 'Maa'. She has come to Dhaka almost 20 times and every time she leaves the country, she leaves behind a part of her heart.

Recently, she visited Dhaka upon the invitation of Bangladesh Rabindra Sangeet Shilpi Shongstha, to celebrate the 34th 'National Rabindranath Music Festival'. She also performed in the two-day-long programme which was organised on May 12 and 13.

This year, her Bangladeshi tour was really special, as she got to visit her idol and legendary Rabindra Sangeet exponent, Sadi Mohammad, for the first time.

In conversation with The Daily Star, the singer opened up about her love for Bangladesh, the Rabindranath Music Festival, and much more.

Hridoy aamar prokash holo anonto aakashe. The sky that hovers over both countries is the same. We are all Bengalis who are bound together with language, culture and love for music. There is a barbed wire between the two countries, but nobody can separate our love for one another. This love is what pulled me back to this country.

Sudeshna Sanyal at the 34th 'National Rabindranath Music Festival'

This year, I came to Dhaka upon the invitation of Bangladesh Rabindra Sangeet Shilpi Shongstha. Renowned singers Amina Ahmed (executive president) and Tapan Mahmud (president of the organisation), gracefully welcomed me to their programme and also made me perform in their programme. I was literally spellbound by all the beautiful performances by the other artistes and the crowd's love for Rabindra Sangeet. This is the third time the organisation invited me and yet every time it feels surreal.

I can honestly say that the people of Bangladesh love Rabindra Sangeet more than West Bengal. These people love Rabindranath from the depths of their heart. The people of Bangladesh know how to show their love, as they always call me to their house whenever I come here.

Sudeshna Sanyal performance at the 34th 'National Rabindranath Music Festival'

My mother inspired me to follow my passion for music and I got my talim under my guru and renowned singer, Kanika Bandyopadhyay. I got my official training in music from Shantiniketan and also pursued Monipura dance from the same institution as well.

Growing up, I listened to Bangladeshi artistes who have inspired me a lot, particularly songs by Sadi Mohammad, Tapan Mahmud, Rezwana Chowdhury Bannya and Mita Haque, among others.

Indian singer Sudeshna with renowned singer Sadi Mohammad

This time, I had the wonderful opportunity to visit my idol Sadi Mohammad and I was really spellbound by the whole experience. As I got to touch his feet and ask for his blessings, I felt like the happiest soul in the world. He is such a wonderful human being and his principles continue to inspire me.

My love for Rabindra Sangeet inspired me to become part of Shubhamastu, a group of female priests, headed by its founding member and eminent priestess, Dr Nandini Bhowmick. Apart from chanting vedic mantras, we also perform Rabindranath's songs while conducting marriages.

I have lots of beautiful memories stored in Bangladesh, but the one that I treasure the most occurred in Shilaidaha, Kushtia. I went there to perform and I met this elderly lady who asked for alms. I told her that I only have Indian rupees and she told me that she didn't need any and gave me BDT 50 taka instead. It's so nice to see such a wonderful soul in this time and age. I took a picture of that lady, which I still keep in my phone. These memories and many more, make my moment in Dhaka truly beautiful.",2023-05-17 03:30:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/music/news/sudeshna-sanyal-the-indian-singer-who-calls-bangladesh-maa-3321631,2023-05-18 10:31:30,thedailystar

619,Eurovision 2023: Sweden's Loreen wins for a second time,"Sweden's Loreen won Eurovision 2023 with the song ""Tattoo"" in Liverpool, northern England, on Saturday, becoming the first woman to triumph twice in the contest.

Finland's Käärijä, a green-bolero-sleeved rapper, came second. He won the viewer vote with ""Cha Cha Cha"", but it was not enough to overtake Loreen's lead after the result from the juries in the 37 participating countries.

""I am seriously overwhelmed,"" Loreen told reporters.

Comparing her win to 2012, she said: ""It's like coming back to a family.""

Loreen is the only person after Ireland's Johnny Logan to win the contest twice, and her victory puts Sweden level with Ireland as the most successful Eurovision countries, 49 years after Abba's famous victory.

The 67th edition of the musical festival was held in the ""City of Pop"" on behalf of Ukraine, last year's winner, which was unable to host this year because of Russia's invasion.

Organisers had to walk a tightrope between putting Ukraine centre stage and steering clear of any overt political messages, which are not allowed in the contest.

They largely succeeded.

Kalush Orchestra, 2022's winner, mixed video recorded in Ukraine with live performance in Liverpool in an opening sequence that included a cameo appearance from Britain's Kate, Princess of Wales, playing the piano.

But as the contest was underway, Russian missiles hit the western Ukrainian city of Ternopil, home to electro-pop duo Tvorchi, this year's entry from the country.

Local authorities, writing on Telegram, said the strike had injured two people.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was barred from addressing worldwide viewers - who numbered 160 million last year - by contest organiser the European Broadcasting Union.

It said that granting his request, which was made with ""laudable intentions"", would be against the non-political nature of the event and its rules prohibiting making political statements.

Nonetheless, the show, watched by thousands in person on the banks of the River Mersey and by millions on TV, was infused with the spirit of Ukraine, notably in a rendition of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" jointly sung in the arena and in Ukraine and which brought many in the audience to tears.

The 26 acts in the final spanned musical styles from ballads to heavy rock to rap, and included a handful of bizarre performances that the contest is renowned for.

Germany finished bottom of the table, just behind Britain, but no country received the dreaded ""nul points.""

Pam Minto, a 37-year-old support worker, said she hoped her city did Ukraine proud.

""We've just loved the whole event right across Liverpool from start to finish. It's just been amazing,"" she said.",2023-05-14 13:47:27,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/music/news/eurovision-2023-swedens-loreen-wins-second-time-3319921,2023-05-18 10:31:34,thedailystar

623,‘PoroCity’- Exploring Dhaka’s urbanism through architecture,"The inauguration of ""PoroCity- Enabling Structures by Graber & Steiger Architects'"", a site-specific spatial intervention by the Swiss architecture studio Graber & Steiger, and supported by Swiss Arts Council Pro Helvetia took place at Kala Kendra, Lalmatia on May 8, 2023. Present at the event as guest speakers were Eros Robbiani, Counsellor, Head of Political, Economic & Cultural Affairs, Embassy of Switzerland in Bangladesh, and Bangladeshi Architect Saif Ul Haque.

Architects Niklaus Graber and Christoph Steiger founded their architectural studio at Lucerne, Switzerland in 1995. In search of permeability and sustainability, Graber & Steiger has chosen Dhaka city which thrives with diversity, and full of enabling structures. The idea behind this exhibition is based on porous structures that enable vivid social interaction and futuristic transformation.

The installation in the Kala Kendra premises invites the general mass to the venue and creates a welcoming place, connected with the urban spaces.

Architect Niklaus Graber explained that structure is constant, non-changeable, whereas the skin can be altered. To create resource-optimised, sustainable shelters came the idea of local but also universal structures that follows the flow of gravity, and ensures free appropriation of users. Thus, the modular exhibition furnishings are available to any citizen who is willing to reuse them.

In one room of Kala Kendra, the steel bars stand on the ground perpendicularly with one another, creating a composition of straight lines whereas in another room, they simply hang from the ceiling. These two rooms display architectural projects done by Graber & Steiger.

'Residential Building in a Tree Grove' was designed in a way that could incorporate the idea of living in tree groves, like the client had wanted. Thus the narrow, elongated zigzag form leaving spaces for vegetation. The sectional perspective of the building model also resembles the trunk and branches of trees.

The third room with diagonally standing frames holds several proposals from the students of Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Switzerland resulting in skillful design possibilities for the 'Multi-Model Transportation Hub in Narayanganj, Bangladesh which was the Masters projects for Design Studio of Fall 2014.

The two smaller spaces of Kala Kendra were reserved for videos one of which was compiled photos from several architects and artists who sent the images of spaces and structures along with the quotes they relate to.

This marvelous exhibition is open for all to visit and will run till May 29, 2023.",2023-05-17 04:30:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/porocity-exploring-dhakas-urbanism-through-architecture-3321671,2023-05-18 10:31:38,thedailystar
624,‘Introspection’: Rumana Rahman’s paintings evoke nostalgia,"The inauguration ceremony of 'Introspection', the first solo visual art exhibition by Rumana Rahman took place at Safiuddin Gallery, Dhanmondi, on May 12, 2023. Chief guest artist and freedom fighter Prof. Syed Abul Barq Alvi graced the event with his presence.

Faculties of Fine Arts Prof. Nisar Hossain, Prof. Shishir Bhattacharjee, Prof Md. Anisuzzaman were present as guest speakers. After the valuable speeches about the artist, the lamp was lit and the exhibition was open for visitation.

The walls of Safiuddin Gallery were embellished with Rumana Rahman's brilliant paintings and sketches. From the exhibits, her affinity towards still life was much clear from the displays.

Lamps, vases, fruits, flowers, clothes etc. were mostly sketched or painted. But her skill is proven by the rickshaw van and pick-up truck with furniture, ladder, and mattress paintings that were done with utmost dedication as everything in them has been carefully drawn and precisely detailed.

The sketches with plants in pots were done with delicate affection. The lamp with bottles, ropes, and utensils is where Rumana's work reached a whole new level as it is done with precision, something that often seems difficult while drawing or painting in grayscale. The painting of the pomegranate reminded me of Ukrainian folklore paintings from a book from my childhood. Rumana's colored paintings in general have the power to invoke nostalgia.

The most prominent characteristic of her artistry is that the subjects she chose appear as if they were from a dream world. It is intriguing how she had chosen traditional objects, the ones generally given to beginners, and took them to a higher level.

The strokes, the lines, the shading, everything spoke of elegance and her ability to turn mundane things into something charming.

625,'Love Letters': Companionship and melancholy etched between the lines,"What happens when two unlikely individuals forge a bond so strong that it stands the test of time; when two hearts, despite the distance between them, carefully nurture their shared connection—all through penning their thoughts in letters? Can two people walking on parallel paths truly unite?

Perhaps the audience in the Neelima Ibrahim Auditorium of Bangladesh Mohila Samity, who were left in a trance after witnessing the magnificent performance by thespian couple Ferdousi Majumdar and Ramendu Majumdar recently, have found an answer.

With the premiere of its two-hander production titled ""Love Letters"", the theatre group, Theatre, explored the mundane musings, companionship, growth, shared nostalgia, love and loneliness of two individuals through the joy of exchanging letters at the Neelima Ibrahim Auditorium on Friday.

Based on the Pulitzer nominee play by renowned American playwright A R Gurney, ""Love Letters"" has been translated and adapted by Professor Abdus Selim and directed by Tropa Majumdar. This was the 48th production by the group and the second show of the play took place on Saturday.

Starring renowned acting couple Ferdousi Majumdar and Ramendu Majumdar, the epistolary play revolves around two polar opposite individuals—Maisha Islam and Ananta Shahed Chowdhury, or rather, the letters they have sent to each other throughout the years. The play required the actors to sit comfortably on their respective chairs onstage and read from the lifelong correspondence between a man and woman which lasted for six decades.

With each letter, the audience gets a clear perception of who these writers are and their personalities as the characters talk about everyday life, their views, vulnerabilities, interests and the Liberation War.

Born into wealthy families, Ananta and Maisha begin writing letters to each other from their childhood, with thank-you notes about birthday party invitations—which later become more intimate as time passes by. The two characters could not be more different, Ananta is disciplined, stoic, a dutiful son with an unwavering sense of responsibility. Meanwhile Maisha is spontaneous, flighty, larger than life, an eccentric soul with a turbulent family life.

Ananta has a penchant for writing letters about everything and anything, while Maisha is letter-averse, yet somehow never fails to respond to his letters despite her complaints, even attaching illustrations with her replies. As they move into their teenage years, it becomes difficult to maintain a friendship that blossoms in proximity, because Ananta is sent to cadet college and Maisha, to a convent school.

Still, they sustain their connection while grappling with their tumultuous feelings, perhaps having an inkling regarding their mutual attraction to one another. However, it isn't realised as they enter another chapter of their lives, Ananta pursuing law school in London and Maisha finding refuge in art. Later on, she moves to Paris and Ananta returns to the country to join the Liberation War. While the characters share mutual romantic attraction, both of them get married to different people.

The years go by and eventually they engage in an affair, albeit it is short lived for it is truly far too late for both of them. After Maisha's untimely death, Ananta sends one last letter to her mother, confessing his love for her. Two people who are completely enamoured with each other, yet physically apart due to time and life, finally are allowed to be together in the afterlife.

From teen banters to the disarming vulnerability as adults, with each wink and sigh– veteran actors Ferdousi Majumdar and Ramendu Majumdar had completely moulded themselves into the roles of Maisha and Ananta, mesmerising theatre lovers of all ages.

""Despite being devoid of gimmicks, we are happy to say that the play was well received by the audience, especially among the younger generation of directors in the theatre sector. If the acting is strong, it is possible to move the audience even with the simplest production,"" said Ramendu Majumdar. ""This play was successful because of the director's contribution.""

The actor said that ""Love Letters"" has been dedicated to the memory of the late eminent actor Aly Zaker—who was initially supposed to perform the play with Ferdousi Majumdar, but unfortunately, could not do so. Ramendu Majumdar also gave special emphasis on the role of music and video screened during the play.

Coupled with the illustrations by artist Pradip Chakraborty and music by Sourendro and Soumyojit, the lives of Ananta and Maisha came to life before the audience. The set, despite the simplicity, was given a personal touch with its design—a bookshelf for Ananta the erudite politician, and painting tools for Maisha, the struggling artist.

""I wanted to keep the production as precise as possible, without any unnecessary embellishments. My priority was to ensure that the audience could concentrate on the play itself and the characters. As for the characters, the two of them are polar opposites of one another and I wanted to make sure that it was evident. The seasoned actors did a remarkable portrayal of both Maisha and Ananta,"" said the play's director, Tropa Majumdar.

""We, as human beings, often don't realise the value of something before we lose it. This is evident in the story of Maisha and Ananta. They may be extremely different, but at the end of the day, these characters gravitate towards each other because they feel a sense of completion. Everything needs a balance. I think the beauty of this play is how it portrays real life and experiences,"" she added.

The set was designed by Palash Hendry Sen, while the costumes were designed by Gulshan Ara Munni. Robin Basak and Najmun Nahar Naju were the actors' assistants. The video for the play was directed by Apon Ahsan and edited by MD. Milon.

Ultimately, ""Love Letters"" is a story of love and the various machinations of love, however it is also a story of loneliness, of missed opportunities and what ifs—which makes it all the more heartbreaking and haunting.",2023-05-14 12:35:30,https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/love-letters-companionship-and-melancholy-etched-between-the-lines-3319866,2023-05-18 10:31:40,thedailystar
626,‘Bornomala’: A visual lesson on Bengali language,"Calligraphy and Typography exhibition opens at Liberation War Museum

""How many of today's generation would be able to name the 11 vowels and 40 consonants of the Bengali alphabet correctly?"" asked Salma Adil, CFO of 'Top of Mind', to the audience. That brings to mind, how many of us know about the many other languages spoken in our country? Bangla, Lusai, Hajong, Meitei, Khasi, how many can you ultimately name?

On May 11, ""Bornomala"", a unique exhibition showcasing typography and calligraphy in different forms and languages of Bangladesh, was inaugurated at the Liberation War Museum premises. An initiative by Krayonmag, a distinctive publishing and social storytelling platform, the exhibition has been organized in partnership with UNDP, Backpage PR, and Volunteer Opportunities. The inauguration ceremony was graced by the likes of renowned novelist, Selina Hossain, poetess Gulshan E Yasmin, UNDP manager Rebecca Sultana, Lion MJF Salma Adil, and more.

While Bangla is the language predominantly spoken in this country, the official language of Bangladesh is often seen to be anglicized and its pronunciations misconstrued. On the other hand, there are numerous indigenous languages at the risk of becoming extinct.

""We fought for our language. It is our responsibility to protect and preserve it. We cannot lose our alphabets due to lack of preservation."" said Selina Hossain, the current president of Bangla Academy.

The exhibition features calligraphy and typography by several artists from Bangladesh as well as India including Arup Baul, Jannatul Ferdous, Shubhra Dhar, Abdul Baten Sarkar, Manowar Hussain Shah, Md. Morsalin Bin Kashem, Obaidullah Omar, Upal Roy Chowdhury, and Mehnaz Tabassum.

""I was very surprised that an exhibition showcasing languages would be arranged. It is one of a kind,"" said one of the artists, Md. Morsalin Bin Kashem. Mehnaz Tabassum, another participant, said, ""There are many lettering artists who wait for such opportunities and we need to reach out to conserve and display this form of art.""

A section of the exhibition has been dedicated to sarees showcasing lettering on the fabric. Sustainable fashion activist, Faiza Faria Ahmed, the owner of Manas and the designer of the sarees said, ""You would find a huge crowd in fairs of entrepreneurs who sell sarees but exhibitions like these are important with a social cause to preserve our cultural heritage.""

627,Flight disruption at Dhaka airport as Biman plane blocks runway,"Flight operations at the Dhaka airport were suspended for around an hour in the wee hours of the morning today as a Biman Bangladesh Airlines plane got stuck at the end of the runway.

Around six incoming and outgoing international flights were delayed due to the shutdown of the runway of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, Group Captain Kamrul Islam, executive director of the airport, told The Daily Star.

Sources at the HSIA said, flight BG387 of Biman Bangladesh Airlines coming from Kuala Lumpur, landed at the airport at around 4:00am today.

But the aircraft Boeing 777 got stuck at the end of the runway while taking a U-turn, blocking air traffic.

The aircraft was pulled back on the runway with the help of two pushback carts. None of the passengers were hurt.

Biman sources said Capt Ishak and Capt Hasan Imam were flying the plane.

Sources at the HSIA said neither of the pilots registered the incident in the air safety report in an apparent move to hide it.

An aviation expert said this could have been a fatal incident as the pilots could not control the speed after landing.

Kamrul Islam said, two to three incoming flights were forced to hover in the sky for some time while three flights were delayed up to 15 to 20 minutes due to the incident.

Asked, he said they will be able to get details about the reasons behind the incident following getting details from Biman.",2023-05-13 13:24:36,https://www.thedailystar.net/nrb/departure-arrival/airlines-more/news/flight-disruption-dhaka-airport-biman-plane-blocks-runway-3318881,2023-05-18 10:31:43,thedailystar
628,Exploitative practices led to halt in hiring of Bangladeshis,"Say Malaysian palm oil firms as West hardens import rules

Some of Malaysia's largest palm oil producers are not hiring workers from Bangladesh because of concerns over exploitative practices during recruitment, companies and labour consultants say.

Planters in the world's second-largest palm oil producer have in recent years stepped up efforts to implement ethical recruitment processes and revamp labour standards after the United States banned imports from two companies over allegations of forced labour.

Migrant workers, especially from Indonesia, India, Bangladesh and Nepal, make up about 80 percent of the workforce on Malaysia's labour-reliant estates.

The Malaysian government suspended all hiring from Bangladesh in 2018 after allegations of corruption in the process. Despite a new labour agreement between the two countries coming into force last year, three plantation companies say their firms have not resumed hiring Bangladeshi workers.

""The main reason was due to a high rate of abscondment among the Bangladesh workers as they were not aware that they were going to work in plantation estates,"" IOI Plantation IOIB.KL, which has not recruited from Bangladesh since 2018, said in an emailed response to Reuters.

A senior executive with another company cited a lack of transparency in the recruitment process and high recruitment fees among workers from Bangladesh.

Sime Darby Plantation SIPL.KL, the world's largest palm oil producer, said it stopped hiring from Bangladesh in 2016. That year, the company also introduced changes aimed at implementing a ""zero recruitment fee policy"".

The International Labour Organisation ranks deception and debt bondage stemming from large recruitment fees among its indicators of ""forced labour"".

Hundreds of workers from South Asia have recently arrived in Malaysia without jobs despite being promised employment and after paying thousands of dollars in recruitment fees. Malaysia has begun investigations.

Malaysia's Human Resources Ministry and the Bangladeshi embassy in Kuala Lumpur did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an industry watchdog based in Malaysia, said proposed legislation in the European Union to prohibit the import and sales of products made with forced labour has prompted the palm oil industry to further address human rights in their operations.

Capt Enamul Haque Talukder, chief of safety, was made the convener of the two-member committee, Biman said in an office order signed by Director Siddiqur Rahman on May 9.

The committee was asked to submit its report within three working days.

The Daily Star on May 9 ran a news titled ""Biman 787 suffers glitch on return flight from Tokyo"".

631,"In Malaysia, migrants say they are in limbo after promised jobs fall through","Stranded without work for months, hundreds of South Asian migrants in Malaysia say they are losing hope after failing to find jobs promised to them by recruitment agents in exchange for thousands of dollars in fees.

At a students' dormitory about 40 km (25 miles) from the capital, Kuala Lumpur, about 500 migrants – mostly young men from Nepal and Bangladesh who had arrived in Malaysia since December – spend their days in crowded rooms or at an open-air cafeteria.

They say they arrived in the country on a three-month work visa that was meant to be upgraded to a work permit, but never was. Because their legal status is unclear, they are afraid to leave the premises, the workers told Reuters at the facility where they are staying.

Many say recruitment agents took their passports and continue to promise them jobs.

""We are all depressed and helpless. We already paid a huge amount for the job. How can I pay that back if I do not have a job?"" a Nepali migrant at the dormitory told Reuters.

The 23-year-old, who declined to be identified for fear of backlash from recruitment agents, signed a two-year contract with a Malaysian cleaning company but has not started work. He said he, like others there, had borrowed 300,000 Nepali rupees ($2,300) to pay an agent for the job. He was promised a monthly salary of 2,062 ringgit ($464.94) per month.

The workers at the facility all tell similar stories: upon arriving in Malaysia, recruiting agencies told them no jobs were immediately available and took them to accommodation facilities to wait. They were then told they would eventually be employed; in the meantime, they must pay for their own food without a salary.

It is unclear how the workers ended up without jobs despite arriving in Malaysia with employment contracts and promises that their temporary work visas would become permanent on arrival. Malaysia last month launched an investigation.

Puncak Jupiter Management Services and Star Domain Resources, listed as employers on some of the workers' travel documents, did not respond to requests for comment. Amial International, one of the recruitment agencies the workers used, did not respond to requests for comment.

Malaysia's Human Resources Ministry and the labour department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The ministry has promised to find jobs for a separate group of 226 stranded workers from Bangladesh and Nepal.

Migrants form the backbone of Malaysia's export-reliant economy, making up about 15 percent of the country's 15 million workforce. Malaysian companies have faced US bans in recent years over use of forced labour.

Rights activists say migrant workers have been at greater risk after Malaysia eased recruitment processes this year in a bid to fill a 1.2 million job shortage across its plantation, manufacturing and construction industries.

""It's a bigger problem now,"" said Adrian Pereira, the executive director of migrant rights' group North South Initiative, adding that his team had received reports of about 1,200 other workers across Malaysia caught in a similar plight.

The Bangladesh embassy in Kuala Lumpur last month called for more transparency by Malaysia to prevent its citizens from being cheated of jobs.

A Bangladeshi official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, told Reuters a ""few hundred"" of its citizens were stuck in Malaysia without jobs.

The Nepal embassy has also said it received such complaints.

At the facility visited by Reuters, the migrants lived four to six in small rooms with bunk beds and one shared bathroom.

Two workers - Nepali citizens aged 43 and 46 – died by suicide between February and April at the facility, the Nepalese embassy in Kuala Lumpur said, citing reports from the Malaysian police and hospitals. Reuters could not determine why the two men killed themselves.

Without income, the migrants find it difficult to buy food and pay back loans back home.

""We still don't know whether we will get a job or not. The agent keeps asking us to wait... it's been three months,"" one Bangladeshi worker said.",2023-05-11 12:18:22,https://www.thedailystar.net/nrb/migration/news/malaysia-migrants-say-they-are-limbo-after-promised-jobs-fall-through-3317156,2023-05-18 10:31:47,thedailystar
632,Biman should stay with Boeing,"Says US plane maker

Boeing and Airbus are now in a battle over the aircraft market in Bangladesh.

After Biman Board of Directors on May 3 approved in principle to purchase 10 aircraft, including two freighters, from European plane maker Airbus, US aircraft manufacturing company Boeing held a press conference in Dhaka yesterday to say that Biman should keep its fleet and operations simple and costs down by using Boeing planes only.

A delegation of Boeing at the press conference in a hotel argued that including Airbus planes in Biman's fleet will increase the national flag carrier's expenses due to different types of spare parts, tooling, engine spares, spare engines, and pilot training requirements.

Head of the delegation, Boeing's managing director (commercial marketing) for Asia Pacific and India, David Schulte said Biman has a small fleet of 21 planes.

He said buying 10 Boeing 787s is the simple solution and buying five Boeing 787s and five Airbus A350s is the complex solution.

He said a complex fleet costs more.

Biman now has four Boeing 777-300 ERs, four Boeing 787-8s, two Boeing 787-9s, six Boeing 737-800s, and five De Havilland Canada Dash-8 Q400, which are short-haul turboprops.

Boeing predicted that driven by the country's growing population, expanding economy and the middle class, air travel will double in Bangladesh over the next decade.

The plane maker provided details about the increasing demand in its Commercial Market Outlook, a yearly forecast of global and regional plane demand.

Bangladesh is expected to have annual air-traffic growth of nearly 8.5 percent, according to Boeing.

To meet strong demand for passenger travel and freight, Boeing anticipates South Asian carriers will need more than 2,300 new planes over the next 20 years, tripling the number of planes now in operation.

Single-aisle planes, like the Boeing 737, will make up nearly 90 percent of South Asia's future fleet.

""Boeing planes have played a tremendous role in the rapid growth of commercial aviation in Bangladesh. Commonality across the fleet will continue to play a major role in furthering growth, especially as it enables our airline customers to reduce operating costs and expenditures associated with training and maintenance,"" said Schulte.

The US plane maker fears losing its strong grip on the Bangladeshi market as the local carriers are mulling planes of arch-rival Airbus.

Besides Biman, Boeing planes dominate the fleet of US-Bangla. The private carrier is set to add Airbus A330 aircraft to its fleet.

Novoair is planning to add Airbus planes to its current turboprop-only fleet.

Asked why the Boeing is losing its market share in Bangladesh, Schulte, not giving a direct answer, said Boeing was looking to engage more with Bangladesh in the days to come.

He said Boeing is in talks with Biman.

Biman's top management had said they were buying 10 new Airbus planes, including two freighters, to expand international routes and carry cargo.

Aviation experts have said Biman's decision to have a mixed fleet was puzzling as it would cause cost escalation. They said buying new freighters will not be economically viable.

Bangladesh Prime Minister's Private Industry and Investment Adviser Salman F Rahman and UK's Investment Minister Lord Dominic Johnson recently signed the agreement for the 10 Airbus planes on behalf of their respective sides in London.

However, Biman Managing Director and CEO Shafiul Azim said the deal with Airbus is at a very preliminary stage. Nothing is set in stone. Biman is checking out the market and it will pick the planes that suit it best.",2023-05-10 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/nrb/departure-arrival/airlines-more/news/biman-should-stay-boeing-3316521,2023-05-18 10:31:49,thedailystar

Bangladesh has chartered four planes to evacuate 555 Bangladeshis to Jedda, Saudi Arabia, from the conflict- stricken Sudan.

""We have chartered four planes with our own funds as we have yet to find available ships from the Saudi authorities to transport the Bangladeshis from Port Sudan to Jeddah,"" said State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shahriar Alam at the foreign ministry today.

Three of the flights will fly today and the other one tomorrow. From Jeddah, the Bangladeshis will be flown home by commercial flights.

634,Biman 787 suffers glitch on return flight from Tokyo,"The weather radar system on the Biman aircraft that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina used to fly to Tokyo broke down on the return flight to Dhaka.

The aircraft, a Boeing 787 that joined Biman's fleet in 2018, dropped off the PM at Tokyo International Airport (Haneda) on the morning of April 25, refuelled, and departed for Dhaka an hour and 45 minutes later.

During the return leg, the pilot noticed that neither of the two weather radar systems were working.

Deprived of a functioning weather radar, the pilot had to navigate the plane through the pitch-black darkness of the evening sky before safely touching down at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 11:17pm.

The pilot-in-command, Captain Ishtiaque Hossain, after landing in Dhaka filed a technical log, which The Daily Star obtained a copy of.

The technical log states that ""Both WXR [weather radar] systems return unreliable, both WXR systems test shows ""WXR fail drv [drive]"" with ""WXR SYS [system]"" advisory message and unusual sound from WXR antenna"".

The log also includes notes about what rectification measures had to be taken after landing.

""Antenna drive unit replaced,"" it said.

The thorough security check that all VVIP flights are subject to prior to flying did not pick up the impending motor failure.

The checks, which is conducted by Biman engineers in the presence of every single intelligence agency, and the Special Security Force, can last up to three days.

The radar system detects weather up to 50 nautical miles ahead of the aircraft, based on which pilots can make directional decisions.

""An aircraft can operate without a weather radar system. The pilot can communicate with the ground and get weather updates. There was a time when planes did not have weather radars,"" said Air Commodore Md Moazzem Hossain, director of engineering and material management at Biman Bangladesh Airlines.

However, over the last 50 years at least, all commercial aircraft come equipped with weather radar systems because ground radar systems can only give weather updates within their range, not for the whole flight, said Biman insiders.

An aircraft being forced to fly without a functioning weather radar system is said to be flying on a ""minimum equipment list"".

On April 19, a Riyadh-bound Biman flight was forced to return to Dhaka airport as the aircraft's weather radar system was not working. The plane was in the air for two and a half hours on a ""minimum equipment list"".

However, a VVIP flight cannot operate on a ""minimum equipment list"", according to the ""red book"", a rulebook on the security protocol for the prime minister.

Air Commodore Hossain called it a ""small problem"" that did not ""pose a safety hazard"".

According to the VVIP flight handling manual by CAAB, the aircraft selected for flying the PM must be grounded for checks and inspections for at least 22 hours before departure, in the case of models like the Boeing 787.

The manual states that the engineers used for checking the aircraft must be pre-selected by the head of the engineering department and handed over to the government's security agencies 48 hours before the departure.

The engineers' names, the specific duties of each, and which part of the plane they will be looking into are listed.

""All equipment taken in/out of the cordoned-off area must be checked at piece level. Any part needed to be replaced must be endorsed in the register mentioning the name of the part with proper specification/part number, the individual carrying the part along with his or her signature,"" says the manual.

A 10-member committee, led by the general manager of central control, oversees the planning and execution of the flight.

""The plane is inspected by our engineers and taken for two ground runs before taking to the air,"" said Air Commodore Hossain.

He denied the prospect of any negligence. ""Even if this problem had happened while the prime minister was in the air, this would not have been negligence. This is an equipment, and anything can happen anytime.""

Captain Siddiqur Rahman, Biman's director of flight operations, also denied any possibility of negligence.",2023-05-09 01:40:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/nrb/departure-arrival/airlines-more/news/biman-787-suffers-glitch-return-flight-tokyo-3314571,2023-05-18 10:31:51,thedailystar

Bankers today decided to pay a total of Tk 110.70 to migrant workers and non-resident Bangladeshis for a US dollar from this week in order to encourage them to send foreign currency through formal channels, according to a meeting.

Banks will offer Tk 108 for each greenback and they would quote the purchase prices by adding 2.5 per cent incentive given by the government at their exchange houses abroad.

From the beginning of April, banks have been paying Tk 104 for a dollar to exporters.

The cumulative total of fatalities was unprecedented over such a short period, he said.

Numbers of boats carrying migrants - most from sub-Saharan Africa, Syria and Sudan - trying to reach Italy from Tunisia have risen sharply in recent months, in part due to a crackdown on departures by authorities in neighbouring Libya.

637,Protest held in front of DW office in Berlin,"Two protest rallies and human chains were organised in front of the Deutsche Welle, Berlin office by ""Bangladesh Civil Society in Europe"" and ""Germany Awami League"" respectively on Monday.

The rally was attended by expatriate Bangladeshis from various cities in Germany including many European countries, reads a press release.

Pointing out DW's recent documentary titled ""How Elite Forces Rab Terrorize the People of Bangladesh"", they said, ""The documentary contains many controversial issues, misinformation and contradictions, which are against Deutsche Welle's fundamental principles.""

They termed the DW report ""very biased, based on vested interest of some actors"". They claimed that the DW needs to follow a holistic approach for their report.

""We believe that this is an ill-politically motivated documentary based on a few outdated issues which were either resolved or on the process of resolution,"" reads the press release.

Civil Society in Europe also said that legal action will be taken if the conspiracy against Bangladesh by DW Bangla Department is not stopped immediately.

In another rally in front of the Berlin office of Deutsche Welle, Germany Awami League leaders said that hatred was being spread against Bangladesh and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina by the recent programmes of the Bangla section of Deutsche Welle.

Some of the people working in this state-owned institution, funded by the German people's taxes, are promoting their own political ideologies and opinions through Deutsche Welle.

638,Recruitment to Malaysia: Still marred by irregularities,"Recruitment of new Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia has been tainted by a number of irregularities, with a few dozen workers falling into trouble, which includes joblessness.

The anomalies surfaced amid allegations of high recruitment costs and ""syndication"", factors which plagued the recruitment process and led to a suspension in the past.

Malaysia reopened its labour market for Bangladesh last year, after nearly four years of suspension, with the first batch of new migrants reaching there in early August under a new arrangement.

Between August 2022 and February 2023, around 1.04 lakh migrant workers went to Malaysia for employment, according to the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET).

However, the Malaysian authorities sent 19 workers home from Kuala Lumpur International Airport on February 17, after the migrants' data were not found in the computerised system.

On March 16, news outlet Free Malaysia Today reported that 10 Bangladeshi workers were detained there after their supposed employer failed to provide them with jobs.

The migrants entered Malaysia last December and were detained for ""not possessing valid documents"", the report said.

They were among 95 workers who paid around RM 20,000 or Tk 4.75 lakh (RM 1 equivalent to Tk 23.76) each in recruitment fees to an agency in Bangladesh, which promised them jobs at an engineering company in Selangor, it added.

Contacted, Nazmus Sadat Salim, minister (labour) of Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, recently said the mission learnt about the incidents and took prompt steps to resolve the issues.

Multiple stakeholders both in Bangladesh and Malaysia are involved in the recruitment of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia. All parties need to be committed and sincere to ensure safe and orderly migration, he said.

A large labour market for Bangladesh, Malaysia hired about 11.61 lakh workers from Bangladesh from 1978 till February this year, shows BMET data.

The Southeast Asian country stopped recruiting Bangladeshi workers in September 2018, after media reports in Malaysia revealed a financial scam involving a ""syndicate"" of 10 Bangladeshi agencies and a Malaysian businessman who charged up to Tk 4 lakh against each worker.

After prolonged negotiations, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in December 2021, lifting the embargo and agreeing to send and receive workers under a new arrangement.

However, a section of recruiting agencies questioned the new arrangement, alleging that a ""syndicate"" of only 25 agencies were given permission to send workers to Malaysia.

Currently, the number of agencies has been increased to 100, according to sector insiders.

The expatriates' welfare ministry fixed the maximum migration cost at Tk 78,990 at the Bangladesh end to send a worker to Malaysia.

After a meeting with Malaysian Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail in Dhaka on February 5, Expatriates' Welfare Minister Imran Ahmad said the MoU is likely to be amended to make the recruitment process easier.

The Bangladeshi minister pointed out the political change in Malaysia, as a new government was formed following a general election in November last year. He said, ""…There will be significant changes in whatever issues we had agreed upon with the previous government.""

Labour migration expert Shariful Hasan said there has been information regarding the joblessness of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia.

In addition to charging high recruitment fees, there have also been allegations of ""syndication"" in sending workers to Malaysia and conducting medical tests of workers in Bangladesh, Shariful said.

""Overall, irregularities... that persisted in the past could not be eliminated,"" he said, adding that incidents of irregularities will augment concern over ensuring jobs for workers who have been in the pipeline.

As the new Malaysian government hinted at bringing change in the recruitment process, the Bangladesh government should also strongly address irregularities by enhancing monitoring mechanisms, he mentioned.

Abul Basher, president of Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (Baira), said there could be some ""stray incidents"" in the recruitment of new Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia.

Baira has taken steps within the organisation and also sought remedy from the expatriates' welfare ministry to stop such incidents, Basher said.

He urged Bangladeshi officials to properly verify documents related to Bangladeshi workers' recruitment before attesting those.",2023-04-19 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/nrb/migration/skilled-migration-more/news/recruitment-malaysia-still-marred-irregularities-3301446,2023-05-18 10:31:56,thedailystar
639,Provide special services to expats returning home for Eid,"Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training urges airport authorities

The Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training (BMET) has made a request to the airport authorities to provide special services to expatriate workers returning to the country during the Eid-ul-Fitr holiday.

Sources at the Dhaka airport said expatriate workers have started returning to the country on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. This trend will continue for the next few days.

BMET wrote a letter to the executive director of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport yesterday making the request.

In the letter, it was said that, on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, around 3,500 and 4,000 expatriates are coming to the country every day amid the heatwave.

""Remittances sent by migrant workers are playing an important role in the socio-economic development of the country. In this context, the Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare has requested all concerned to provide special services which are provided at the airport so that the migrant workers can get the joy of returning home safely,"" reads the letter.

While talking to The Daily Star, Group Captain Kamrul Islam, executive director of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, said work is going on to improve the quality of passenger services.

""For this, meetings are being held regularly with domestic and foreign airlines operating at the airport. Every expatriate who comes to the country during the Eid holiday brings many gifts for their relatives. Airlines have been given special instructions to ensure that no passenger's luggage goes missing. Apart from this, a meeting has been held with APBn, immigration and customs authorities in this regard.""

640,Technical glitch forces Biman’s Riyadh-bound flight to return,"A Riyadh-bound flight of Biman Bangladesh Airlines was forced to return to Dhaka airport as the aircraft's weather radar system was not working.

The flight BG-339 carrying 347 passengers on board departed from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at around 2:00am today, Tahera Khondokar, general manager, public relations, Biman Bangladesh Airlines, told The Daily Star.

Sources at the HSIA, said, hours into the flight, the pilot of the aircraft realized that the aircraft's weather radar was not working.

As a result, the pilot was not getting weather or wind speed updates of Riyadh or the flying path.

The pilot then contacted the control tower and decided to return to Dhaka. The Boeing 777-300 returned to Dhaka airport at around 4:30am.

The weather radar system informs a pilot about the weather, storm and wind conditions. Also, the radar system identifies alternative routes to a pilot in case of storms or adverse weather conditions.

Asked HSIA Executive Director Group Captain Kamrul Islam told Daily Star that the aircraft made a technical landing due to weather radar problem.

Tahera said after fixing the problems, the flight left Dhaka at around 7:26am.",2023-04-19 12:45:47,https://www.thedailystar.net/nrb/departure-arrival/news/technical-glitch-forces-bimans-riyadh-bound-flight-return-3300916,2023-05-18 10:31:58,thedailystar
641,Dhaka airport to get better eyes in the skies,"New radar to make airspace safer, stop unseen overflights

Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport will have a new radar system that will cover the entire airspace of the country.

Sources at the airport said the country's airspace is now controlled with a 38-year-old radar system and sometimes it is difficult to detect planes flying over Bangladesh.

With the installation of the sophisticated radar system at a cost of Tk 730.13 crore, such problems will be over, said officials of Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh.

The existing radar cannot detect all planes making overflights in Bangladesh's airspace, especially over the Bay of Bengal. The International Court of Arbitration awarded Bangladesh the rights to an area of about 19,000 square kilometres in the Bay.

As a result, Bangladesh cannot collect overflight fees properly, said CAAB officials. Bangladesh charges a minimum of $500 in overflight fees.

""The country's airspace will be more secure, aviation will be safer, and revenues from our aviation sector will go up with the setting up of the new radar and ATC [air traffic control] towers,"" said CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal M Mafidur Rahman.

He said 87 percent of the radar installation work has been completed. ""We have a plan to open the radar system in October this year.""

Mafidur, however, said it may take another year to make the system fully operational as software integration work will continue and the whole project will be done by the middle of 2024. The system is being set up by Thales LAS, a French radar-manufacturing company.

When the radar system will be fully operational, Bangladesh will have full control over its airspace, the CAAB chief said.

Mafidur said, ""The existing system is very old. There are many complaints about it.""

The CAAB boss said officials were sent to France for training on the radar operations.

""The country's airspace will be more secure, aviation will be safer, and revenues from our aviation sector will go up with the setting up of the new radar and ATC [air traffic control] towers."" — Air Vice Marshal M Mafidur Rahman CAAB Chairman

He added that the base has already been completed where the radar system will be set up. The tower construction work is going on and it will be finished on time.

State Minster for Civil Aviation M Mahbub Ali said the new sophisticated radar would bring the entire airspace of the country under surveillance.

On October, 2021, CAAB signed an agreement with Thales LAS.

Asked, aviation expert ATM Nazrul Islam said installation of the new radar will enhance the capacity of air traffic management system and smooth air space management within the coverage and expedite traffic movement.

He added that within territorial airspace, the new radar will help reduce traffic violations as well.",2023-04-19 01:50:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/nrb/departure-arrival/airlines-more/news/dhaka-airport-get-better-eyes-the-skies-3300236,2023-05-18 10:32:00,thedailystar
642,CAAB suspends pilot Sadia’s licence,"Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has finally suspended the privileges of commercial pilot license (CPL) of Sadia Ahmed, a first officer of Biman Bangladesh Airlines, for her alleged forgery of Higher Secondary School Certificate.

A recent letter to Sadia, signed by Air Commodore Shah Kawsar Ahmed Choudhury, member (Flight Standard & Regulations) of CAAB, said, ""An investigation has been initiated on the report in The Daily Star on March 1 regarding your HSC examinations details. CAAB, hereby, suspends all the privileges of your CPL#470 till further notice.""

Sadia, who was suspended from Biman, in connection with the forgery, reportedly left the country late last month without appearing before a probe body of the national flag carrier.

Sources in CAAB said Sadia won't be able to fly any commercial flights at home or abroad from now on.

A top official of CAAB yesterday told The Daily Star that after completion of the investigation, they will decided on revoking her CPL.

Biman has also launched an investigation into Sadia following The Daily Star report that said Sadia forged the certificate to claim that she was a student of the science group when she was actually a student of arts.

Meanwhile, Biman has suspended four other contractual pilots as they have failed to complete their training within the one year stipulated time.

The five pilots are: Irfanul Haq, Shah Nasimul Awal, Sadia Ahmed, Sayed Muhit Rezwan and Mohammad Atiqur Rahman.

The five pilots failed to complete initial route check (IRC), according to a source in Biman.

In February last year, Biman recruited a batch of contractual pilots to fly its Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, claiming that it needed pilots immediately due to a shortage.",2023-04-13 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/nrb/departure-arrival/airlines-more/news/caab-suspends-pilot-sadias-licence-3296606,2023-05-18 10:32:01,thedailystar

644,Buying Airbus planes: Biman’s move puzzling,"Experts say purchase of freighters, operation of mixed fleet will hurt flag carrier

Biman last year carried a little over 28,000 tonnes of freight in the cargo hold of planes making international flights when it had the capacity to transport over 4.98 lakh tonnes.

This is about 6 percent utilisation of the capacity, and yet Biman is planning to buy two new Airbus freighters.

An audit by the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) also shows that in the same year, Biman carried 20.58 lakh passengers on international flights and had around 7 lakh seats vacant, which is just under 76 percent utilisation.

This happened after the national flag carrier bought 12 Boeing planes spending around Tk 19,000 crore between 2011 and 2019. The aircraft purchased include multiple huge Boeing 777-300ERs, efficient Boeing 787-8s and -9s, and workhorse Boeing 737-800s.

But the planes are not properly utilised largely due to shortages of pilots and cabin crew members, and poor planning and management, experts have said. Biman failed to launch adequate number of new routes for the planes' best use, they added.

They questioned why the Biman Board of Directors on May 3 approved in principle the purchase of 10 Airbus planes, including the two freighters.

Biman's top management believes the company will make money ferrying cargo in the freighters and the new Airbus planes will help Biman expand its reach.

An aviation expert, however, says buying the freighters will not be economically viable at all.

""First of all, airfreight is a seasonal business in Bangladesh. For five or six months of the year, there is almost no demand,"" aviation expert Kazi Wahidul Alam told The Daily Star.

The season is dependent on garment products and vegetable exports.

Secondly, most outbound freight goes to the West, and the items Bangladesh imports largely come from China, Hong Kong and Japan. So, the inbound cargo flights from the West and the outbound flights to the East would be virtually empty, he said.

""Therefore, we can say that the cargo business here is mainly one-way. You can never survive doing one-way cargo business,"" said Alam, the editor of Bangladesh Monitor, an aviation and tourism magazine.

He said some foreign carriers operate cargo flights in Bangladesh but they operate flights only when there is demand in the peak season.

An airline can bargain better with the manufacturer if it buys planes from both companies. In the case of carriers with large fleets, you can enjoy some advantages. But from the point of view of operations, if you have aircraft of both plane makers, the disadvantages are so many. — Aviation expert ATM Nazrul Islam

For example, since Dhaka has no inbound demand, Emirates Skycargo planes usually fly first to Bangkok or Singapore carrying goods and then make a stopover in Dhaka during the return flight to Dubai to pick up freight that they deliver to the West, he said.

""The large carriers operate this way to be able to carry cargo both ways. But we won't be able to do that as we never made the strategic plan,"" he said.

A cargo division official of Biman said, ""We couldn't even utilise the full capacity of our cargo hold in passenger flights. Then What is the point of buying brand new freighters without proper marketing and planning?""

Airlines do not often buy brand new freighters. They usually buy old and used freighters because new ones are rarely commercially viable, he said, requesting anonymity.

Alam adds that no airlines are currently flying dedicated cargo flights to Dhaka because the demand is very low.

Carriers like Emirates, Etihad, Qatar, Fly Dubai, Turkish and Kuwait Airways can't even fill the cargo holds of their passenger planes despite their huge network and high number of onward destinations they serve from their hubs.

Biman only serves a handful of destinations.

""We don't have the required quality infrastructure, international standard cargo village, and loading-unloading facilities… Biman getting into dedicated cargo business will be suicidal,"" Alam said, adding, ""It is not the time for Biman to have dedicated freighter service.""

""Does the revenue earned by Biman carrying freight in the cargo hold of passenger planes last year justify operating dedicated cargo flights?"" he said.

The global commercial aviation sector is dominated by the duopoly of US plane maker Boeing and European manufacturer Airbus.

Aviation experts are critical of Biman's attempt to use planes of both makers, known in aviation sector as using a mixed fleet.

The national flag carrier will have to train its cockpit, cabin crew members and engineers afresh to deal with the new aircraft. All these will require a lot of money.

""Unfortunately, we see such decisions being imposed on Biman from the outside,"" Alam said, adding that Biman should be given the liberty to make its own decision.

He said Biman still owes different organisations Tk 3,500 crore, which suggests that the money spent on buying planes over the last decade has not had the desired outcome.

Another aviation expert, ATM Nazrul Islam, now the MD of the government-appointed Board of Directors for United Airways, said there are advantages and disadvantages of using mixed fleet.

""An airline can bargain better with the manufacturer if it buys planes from both companies. In the case of carriers with large fleets, you can enjoy some advantages. But from the point of view of operations, if you have aircraft of both plane makers, the disadvantages are so many,"" he said.

Biman Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Shafiul Azim said, ""The decision to launch several new routes, including to Japan and the US, has already been made. The procurement of Airbus planes is part of our plan.""

State Minister for Civil Aviation M Mahbub Ali said Biman using aircraft of Boeing and Airbus will not create any problem as many large carriers use mixed fleet.

Biman has 21 planes -- four Boeing 777-300 ERs, four Boeing 787-8s, two Boeing 787-9s, six Boeing 737-800s, and five short-haul De Havilland Canada Dash-8 Q400s.

645,Bangladeshis among 113 migrants rescued in Mexico,"Authorities in northwest Mexico rescued 113 kidnapped migrants of different nationalities, including Bangladeshis, from a building along the border with the United States, the state prosecutor's office said.

Thousands of migrants fleeing violence and poverty risk abduction and exploitation at the hands of criminal gangs while crossing Mexico on the way to the US border.

The latest discovery in the municipality of San Luis Rio Colorado, which borders the US state of Arizona, arose from follow-up investigations by authorities who found on Friday 10 Colombian citizens presumed to have been kidnapped.

""This time people from El Salvador, Honduras, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, United States, India, Peru, Nepal, Bangladesh, Cuba, Colombia, Brazil and Afghanistan were brought to safety,"" the prosecutor's office of Sonora state said on its official Facebook page.

Five individuals believed to be ""responsible for the crimes against the migrants"" were arrested as part of the operation, two of whom are Honduran nationals.

Police forces that carried out the rescue were greeted ""with applause, blessings and prayers"" by the group of foreigners held captive in the house, the prosecutor's office said.

Last month, 63 migrants from Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Dominican Republic and Mexico were kidnapped in the same region while trying to reach the US border. All of them were rescued alive.

Mexican authorities have urged asylum seekers not to travel to the border in the hope that the United States will allow them to enter next week, when it lifts Covid-19 rules used to block most migrants for the past three years.

The measure, activated in 2020 under former president Donald Trump's administration as part of the Covid-19 emergency, allows the immediate expulsion of people without papers even if they request asylum.

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Friday migrants were being lured to the frontier by rumors that they will be able to cross over without being sent back, criticizing people smugglers for spreading ""false"" information.",2023-05-07 16:21:38,https://www.thedailystar.net/nrb/migration/news/bangladeshis-among-113-migrants-rescued-mexico-3313611,2023-05-18 10:32:06,thedailystar
646,Biman eyeing 10 Airbus planes,"Biman directors have accepted in principle a proposal to buy 10 Airbus planes.

The planes include two freighters, the purchase of them will be first for the national flag carrier.

The Biman Board of Directors made the decision at a meeting on Wednesday in the hope that Biman will operate on more international routes than the current 20.

M Mahbub Ali, state minister for civil aviation, said the Biman directors accepted an offer from Airbus for two freighters.

""Airbus has given us an approximate price. Now our technical committee members will sit together and discuss,"" he told The Daily Star.

""We have expressed [to Airbus] our intention to buy 10 planes in phases,"" he said, adding that Airbus is likely to deliver the first two planes in 2026 or 2027.

Contacted, a Biman director said, ""Our main target is to get two freighters from Airbus as we have a huge demand for shipping cargo.""

Large amounts of garment products, pharmaceutical items and perishable goods are shipped to different destinations every day, the official said.

""Fourteen foreign airlines operating cargo services have grabbed the market. But Biman has not been able to earn money because it does not have a cargo plane.""

Besides, the airlines offering the service are draining the country's foreign exchange, aviation insiders say.

Biman currently relies on cargo holds of passenger planes.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) in a statistics in February said that global air cargo demand rose above pre-pandemic levels.

About the purchase of the eight passenger planes, the official said, ""We have given the approval in principle as the first step. We recommended negotiating with the aircraft manufacturer in this regard. The technical review, signing of agreement and other procedures will follow.""

Biman Managing Director and CEO Shafiul Azim said the plan is to expand Biman's route to Tokyo, Rome, Male, Colombo, Chennai, Sydney, and New York.

State Minister Mahbub Ali said using Boeing and Airbus planes will not be a problem for Biman as other large carriers use aircraft from both brands.

After becoming a public limited company in 2007, Biman spent around Tk 19,020 crore on new planes.

In 2008, Biman had inked a deal with Boeing for purchasing 10 new planes, including four 787-8s. Two more 787-9s were purchased from Boeing later.

Biman currently has four Boeing 777-300ERs, four Boeing 787-8s, two Boeing 787-9s, six Boeing 737-800s, and five De Havilland Canada DHC-8 Q400s.

Despite a surge in the outflow of migrant workers, remittances to Bangladesh declined 16.27 per cent year-on-year to $1.68 billion in April, an unpromising development that may deepen the volatility in the economy.

A Bangladesh Bank official said the hundi cartel, an illegal cross-boundary financial transaction, is mainly responsible for the slide in remittance.

Remittances, however, slightly increased 2.36 per cent year-on-year to $17.71 billion in the first 10 months of this fiscal year, data from the Bangladesh Bank showed.

649,"Thousands of migrants, including some Bangladeshis, stranded in Niger's desert","A long line of people, including Bangladeshi nationals, appears in silhouette, walking along the flat desert in northern Niger.

The strong walkers are at the front. The weakest at the rear.

Every week hundreds more migrants thrown out of Algeria end up here in Assamaka, the first village on the Niger border.

More than 4,500 of them so far have washed up in this tiny windswept corner of the Sahara -- Malians, Guineans and Ivorians mainly, but also Syrians and even Bangladeshis.

They have marched across 15 kilometres (nine miles) of wasteland only to enter a new purgatory.

A transit centre run by the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) cannot cope with the numbers and only handles about a third of arrivals.

""When we got here we were told we were not recognised as migrants by the IOM and so we had to pay for our own transport to return home,"" said Abdoul Karim Bambara from the Ivory Coast.

Assamaka's water tanks are nearly dry, food rations insufficient and shelter from the cruel sun is in short supply.

In temperatures that can nudge 48 degrees Celsius (118 degrees Fahrenheit), thousands seek shade beneath walls or under tarpaulins.

The migrants say that they were stripped of their possessions in Algeria, the stepping-stone to a hoped-for new life in Europe.

They cannot afford to pay for travel home, or even to phone relatives.

They are stranded in what is an open prison in the desert, sometimes for months.

'LIKE CATTLE'

Their numbers include talented and educated people -- doctors, students and traders.

But around the barbed-wire walls of the IOM compound, individual traits are forgotten as an angry crowd of needy people forms, pushing and shoving in visceral despair.

""We have become like cattle,"" said Herman, also from Ivory Coast.

Many of the migrants are physically ill, ravaged by scabies or suffering infected wounds. All are hungry.

""You saw that?"" one man said, showing a lump of fly-infested sticky rice. ""Would you eat that? We are falling sick from that.""

Off to the side, two groups of hungry men are throwing stones at each other amid a cloud of dust.

Fights are common. Days earlier, the death of a Cameroonian ignited a riot that was put down with tear gas. The IOM centre was ransacked by the protesters.

""We are all traumatised. People can no longer control themselves, they are losing their minds, there's nothing here. People are dying,"" raged Aboubacar Cherif Cisse from Sierra Leone.

""If there was enough to eat, people wouldn't fight, but there is no food -- what can they do? If they have nothing, they will fight each other just to stay alive,"" said Mohamed Mambu, who represents Sierra Leoneans at another transit centre at Arlit, 200 kilometres (120 miles) away.

The 1,500 residents of Assamaka are overwhelmed by the migrant situation.

""They are everywhere in the village, near the health centre, by the walls,"" said Francois Ibrahim who works with an NGO called Alarme Phone Sahara, which helps migrants stranded in the desert.

Ibrahim said the migrants steal animals from residents and kill them for food.

'UNPRECEDENTED'

The number of migrants pushed into Niger has been increasing since the start of the year, creating an ""unprecedented situation,"" according to the French charity Doctors without Borders (MSF).

Niger's regional capital Agadez, 350 kms from Assamaka, has a third transit centre, but all three are overwhelmed.

The roads heading south are threatened by armed jihadist groups, which means migrants have to be flown out on charter flights for their safety.

""The flights are often cancelled... Yet every week people are expelled"" from Algeria, said Ousmane Atair, a manager at the Arlit centre.

Migrants are taken by road from Assamaka to Arlit and then on to Agadez in convoys organised by IOM sub-contractors.

The region seems to be paying the price for its relative stability.

""The road from Assamaka to Arlit is the best protected and that's why the migration flow heads this way,"" said Arlit mayor Abdourahamane Maouli.

With demand for international aid soaring globally, the European Union, eager to keep migrants away, has become the main financial support for the IOM in the region.

""The IOM plays a key role in the policy of EU states to externalise their borders to African territory,"" said Alarme Phone Sahara.

Tari Dogo, secretary of the regional council, said Agadez became the ""last gateway"" to Europe after the Libyan crisis erupted in 2011, but the EU had failed to act decisively to tackle the migrant flow.

""The European Union bears its share of responsibility for this situation,"" he said.",2023-04-06 07:55:15,https://www.thedailystar.net/nrb/news/thousands-migrants-including-some-bangladeshis-stranded-nigers-desert-3290386,2023-05-18 10:32:12,thedailystar
650,"Biman pilot dodges probe, ‘leaves country’","Sadia Ahmed, a first officer of Biman Bangladesh Airlines, who was suspended for forging her educational certificate, reportedly left the country without appearing before a Biman probe body.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) has asked Biman to suspend her ""privilege of the licence"" so that she cannot fly any commercial aircraft at home or abroad.

""The CAAB is yet to revoke her licence as we will have to follow some legal procedure and investigation,"" a top official of the regulatory authority told The Daily Star.

Wishing anonymity, the official also said that following a report by The Daily Star on March 1 about irregularities in hiring pilots, CAAB asked the national flag carrier to investigate Sadia and submit a report to it.

Sadia had submitted a forged educational certificate that said she was a student of science group during her Higher Secondary Certificate exams.

Data retrieved from the Dhaka education board shows that she was a student of humanities, and she passed with second division from Shaheed Anwar Girls' College with Bangla, English, civics, psychology, and home economics.

The CAAB rulebook mandates that all commercial pilots must have an educational qualification of HSC (Science) or equivalent with physics and mathematics mandatory.

Sadia is the wife of Captain Sazid Ahmed who was recently removed from the post of chief of training following allegations of irregularities including harassment of female cockpit crew, sources at Biman said.

Biman Managing Director and CEO Shafiul Azim yesterday said the probe body had asked Sadia to appear before it on March 30 and respond to the allegations against her.

""But instead of appearing before the committee, she sent an email that she is abroad,"" added the Biman boss.

The Daily Star received a copy of the email in which Sadia said, ""[sic] My family life and safety was at a serious stake. As a result I became very sick and was later diagnosed with nerve entrapment with a requirement of immediate treatment. At that point I was not been able to handle all this harassment including all social pressures in this health condition and decided to leave the country for the time being.""

After The Daily Star report that Sadia forged her certificate was found to be true, Biman suspended her and launched a thorough probe, said the Biman MD.

""As she didn't appear before the probe body, the committee will take actions against her in line with the rules,"" he said.

The Biman chief also said they have already requested CAAB to take action against Sadia.

""As a carrier, we cannot revoke her licence. It is the jurisdiction of CAAB as it issues the licences to pilots,"" said the Biman MD.

Shafiul vowed that they would follow due process. ""Good governance must be established in Biman. We will bring everything on track.""

Even though Sadia said she has left the country, a number of sources in the carrier told this newspaper that she was actually in Bangladesh.

Meanwhile, a section of Biman officials was critical of CAAB for seeking an explanation from the carrier for appointing Captain Ishtiaque Hossain as chief of planning and scheduling.

651,Women's network in Sydney working to battle stigma against mental illness in Bangladeshi communities,"Mental illness and the disabilities associated with it has long had a strong stigma in countries like Bangladesh. The pandemic only served to further highlight such problems.

This is why the majority of sufferers endure their anguish in silence. Family members try to hide their illness and seek alternative cures from shamans or religious figures.

A new group in Australia, under the banner of Sydney Women's Bangla Network (SWBN), seeks to attack this stigma and isolation prevalent in most Bangladeshi communities.

Founded by a group of mothers who have children with special needs, including autism, the group hopes to help the suffering families. It also aims to improve the family members' knowledge about accessing help.

It is especially notable in a country like Australia which has some of the fastest rising rates of autism diagnosis in the world.

This is because disability-related funding is linked to the diagnosis of autism. Currently, one in 10 children in Australia has been diagnosed with autism and availing services such as speech therapy or counselling funded by the government. Almost a third of the half a million Australians who receive disability funding qualify for the funding through autism diagnosis.

Autism is a neuro-development disorder first described 80 years ago.

It refers to those who suffer from a combination of language delay, inability to read social cues and who often have unusual or eccentric interests. They are often brilliant at highly technical matters such as computer programming but are incapable of relating to other people socially.

The definition of the diagnosis has been loosened in the past two decades, most relevant in the Western world where it is called a spectrum of problems related to socialising, language and sensory difficulties.

Meanwhile, in South Asia, the prevalence is believed to be around one in 160 people, less than a third of the rate in Western societies.

This opportunity to access government funding and help for serious mental illnesses is exposing even more the stigma in traditional communities like Bangladeshi ones.

In the mainstream population, I have patients and their families putting pressure on me to diagnose them with autism so that they can access services.

In many cases, someone is on the border, experiences a component of social problems or language delay, but not always clearly fits the entire syndrome.

The difference between the mainstream population of a Western society and my Bangladeshi patients is stark.

Instead of patients and families actively seeking a diagnosis, I receive desperate requests to help overturn the prospect of their children being called autistic.

This is despite the reality that their children will receive significant amounts of funding from the government in terms of treatment and therapies if diagnosed autistic. Sometimes they receive an extra teacher in the classroom too.

But many Bangladeshi families fear that the social stigma will drive isolation and a marked decline in social status.

At the opening programme of SWBN, there were heartfelt stories about challenges mothers experienced regarding their children. One mother, Nudrat Lohani, broke down in tears about the isolation from other families she experienced. Another related how they no longer visit relatives in Bangladesh because they fear their autistic child would not be able to cope amid the noise and sensory overload so prevalent in Bangladeshi cities, especially in Dhaka.

They also worried that the lack of services and knowledge regarding those with mental disabilities in Bangladesh would make their travels especially problematic. This has only exacerbated their sense of isolation, not just among the local community but also from their extended family in Bangladesh.

A parallel problem that has emerged is that some local Bangladeshi parents do not even seek help for their children, despite recommendations from teaching authorities. This has exposed the fact that many people within cultures like that of Bangladeshis do not always understand the importance of social skills in development.

Economies are becoming more service-oriented, making skills in communication and socialising even more important.

But I see some families where the children may perform in their studies reasonably well, but they have no friends and little interest in forming social connections.

Some parents do not notice this as a major problem, highlighting the lack of emphasis on such skills in our culture. Yet these are the skills that predict success in both career and relationships.

In fact, instead of seeking help, sometimes families try and marry off their children when adults, despite them clearly having major intellectual deficiencies.

Unfortunately, these types of cases in the Bangladeshi community are not uncommon. There have been notable cases where parents have coordinated marriages under Shariah law.

However, courts later overturned the ruling due to the autistic person being unable to give legal consent under British law. There was a highly publicised case in 2008 where Westminster Social and Community Services stepped in.

To be fair to Bangladesh, the country has made some legal strides in the realm of disability. The Disability Rights Act of 2013 for example has enshrined equal rights for those suffering a disability in line with the United Nations charter.

Non-profit groups such as Shuchona, established in 2014, have also played a role in attempting to improve awareness regarding disorders like autism and intellectual delay.

But unfortunately, cultural and social attitudes do not always follow legal rulings. The stigma against autism sufferers, as it is with all those suffering mental illness, remains high. Our tight-knit families can help give social roles and structure to those suffering such problems, in a way the Western societies do not, but it can also lead to blame against the mothers.

Groups like Sydney Women's Bangla Network are critical in improving the stigma surrounding disorder like autism and mental illness more generally.

Their work will have relevance not just in Australia, but it can also be a bridge in improving disability rights and awareness in Bangladesh.

652,Pilot's death: Deceased's sister calls for CAAB probe,"Tala Elhendy Josephano, sister of Gulf Air pilot Mohammad Yousef Hassan Al Hindi, today called upon the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) to investigate her brother's death and take action for the negligence of the airlines.

Addressing at a press conference at city's Dhaka Reporters Unity, Tala Elhendy said she had contacted CAAB on March 7, requesting the regulatory authority to investigate the role of Gulf Air for its negligence.

""However, they have not responded to the issue,"" she added.

The Jordanian-American Mohammad Yousef pilot died on December 14 due to negligence of city's United Hospital, her sister alleged.

Tala Elhendy alleged that her brother was not given timely and proper treatment even after he was admitted to the hospital following heart attack.

United Hospital, however, in a statement had claimed that the allegations of mistreatment and medical negligence were ""completely false and fabricated.""",2023-04-03 17:45:48,https://www.thedailystar.net/nrb/departure-arrival/airlines-more/news/pilots-death-deceaseds-sister-calls-caab-probe-3288236,2023-05-18 10:32:16,thedailystar
653,Meghalaya land of majestic waterfalls,"A roadside falls to Syndai village

It was a hilly meandering road skirting the India-Bangladesh border. By-passing a dense betel nut orchard, our car was heading towards Syndai, a village of Meghalaya.

The scenic beauty of the villages along the road was captivating. The structures and decorations of every village dwelling were certainly showing off the dwellers aesthetic taste. Presence of cars at the doorstep of many households was also indicating the financial state of the Khasi tribe of this area. Betel leaves and nuts were not only the source of their income, but their red-stained lips also showed that these were close to their daily life.

Natural beauty and proximity have made Meghalaya one of my favourite travel destinations. The enormous green mountains covered with white clouds, fascinating waterfalls, the unique lifestyle of people – all these have made Meghalaya a unique place in the whole world.

Among my travel companions was Mustafiz Ratan, who visited Meghalaya at least 30 times. This time ur plan was to visit some less familiar places and waterfalls.

The previous day, we started our journey from Dhaka at 11:00pm and reached Tamabil port, Sylhet at around 6:00am. We crossed the border by 10:30am, and finally started our tour from Dawki Bazar at around 1:00pm.

Reaching Syndai after one and a half hours by car, we found it nearly empty. We came here to visit the Syndai Cave. We managed to find a local to get suggestions on how to get there. A rocky trail led us to the entrance in a very short time and we proceeded into it with our torch lights. It is a natural cave like the famous Mawsmai Cave in Sohra, and many others in Meghalaya. Though small, it was gorgeous.

Leshka river

Afterwards, as per our plan, we started for a waterfall near Syndai village around 4:00pm. A youngster from the village guided us through the 40-minute trail towards the Thoyaidoloi Falls.

The hike was through a mountain trail alongside small mountain streams, which, according to the local guide, lead to the falls. Hillocky thickets on the way reminded us that this path is not well trodden. Unfortunately, we started late for the falls and it was already dark. Besides, we had to cross streams and our guide suggested that we fall back as it was not safe to cross the raging streams fed by recent rainfalls.

And respecting the unwritten rules of the mountains, we decided to step back. We weren't happy, but it was unavoidable.

Later on, having snacks in a village store, we started towards Risamina Homestay, our night stay in Amlarem town in Jaintia Hills District of Meghalaya.

Considering amenities, most of the Bangladeshi travellers prefer to stay in either Sohra or Shillong in Meghalaya. But because our plan was more focused on trekking, we choose to stay closer to our travel destinations. That's why we are in Amlarem. We had a homely experience there.

We planned to make the most out of the next day. After roaming around a little bit, we left the homestay at 8:30am, and had our breakfast in Amlarem bazar.

Lumshken Falls

The day's first destination was Amtasam falls. With the help of google maps and locals, we figured out the trail towards Amtasam. Our hike started through a pineapple garden. After just 20 minutes hike down the trail, we had a glimpse of the waterfall from a distant. The splashing water had created a reservoir of clear water down there. It was inviting us to take a dip!

We had to be extra cautious as the rocky stairs were extremely slippery.

Reaching the water reservoir, a few of our mates, couldn't resist the water. The outstanding views kept the rest of us busy. I sat on a boulder and kept looking at the untamed beauty around. The sight of water splashing down through the green mountains on the crystal clear reservoir was simply breathtaking. We had spent almost an hour there before we started hiking back.

Going downhill to the waterfall was risky but going up while returning proved to be challenging. Keeping in mind about the busy schedule for the rest of the day, we tried our best to make it to the top as soon as possible.

Lumshken Falls upper

After reaching Amlarem, we headed towards Leksha Dam along the road to Rimbai at around noon. Our car ride took almost an hour to reach the dam. Built on the basin of the mountain river Myntdu in East Jaintia hill, the dam was a sight to behold. Myntdu river is the lifeline for the people of the Jowai region as it remains the main source of water.

Standing on the dam, we could see the region better. Due to the security issues, taking photos of the dam area was not allowed. Anyhow, we captured some. We wanted to visit another falls named Leshka there, but could not as landslides cut access to it.

Our next estination was Lumshken, a village further up in the mountains. The area has several waterfalls but its relatively remote location discourages most of the travellers from visiting.

Leshka Lake

It was a continuous uphill drive through winding mountains. With every sharp bend of the road, the scenes seemed more stunning. After an hour's drive, again with the guidance of the locals, we finally reached Lumshken.

The next destination was the most beautiful falls of the day, Tangnup. With a local youngster as guide, we took a 20-minute hike through a mountain valley. And then we had the glimpse of the majestic waterfall.

We passed the slippery part with extra caution, and finally the waterfall was there in front. What a wonderful view it was!

As our entire itinerary contained less trodden places, we fhardly encountered any tourists!

Lamo Falls

However, we met a group of female north Indian travelers in Lumshken who were surprised to meet a Bangladeshi group at such remote spot!

The sun was already in the west sky, and we needed to return to the village. But on the way back, Nayem, one of our tour mates, reminded us about the first step of Tangnup just 15 minutes away!

That was enough to persuade us.

After visiting the first step of Tangrup, it was time to visit the last waterfall of the day, the famous Lamo falls. But unfortunately we lost our way.

After wasting some precious time, when we got back on the the trail, the sun was almost about to set.

Kudengrim Falls

We couldn't but waste a few more minutes closely inspecting the road. The blocks used to build it were made of polythenes. A signboard said that the 1.5km long road was the first of its kind in India built using plastic cell technology in 2019.

Meanwhile, it started raining when we reached the waterfall at 6:15pm. Surrounded by pure nature, the mesmerising waterfall in the twilight was a sight to behold.

Packing activities for the day, when we got back on the national highway that went through Siliguri to Tripura, it was already dark.

Amtasam Falls

Having a brief break in Rimbai market, we reached Amlarem at around 10:00pm. That night we enjoyed the rain till late hours, had fun together, and thus woke up late next morning. In the meantime, some of our tour mates came back visiting Krangsuri falls, which was pretty close to our location. Though I been there, when I heard the overnight rain made it a giant, I regretted missing the sight!

The next day, we started around 11:30am for Kudengrim village and reached there after 1.5 hours of car ride. Enjoying all the beautiful dwellings in the village, we walked towards Kudengrim Falls and Living Root Bridge. Again, a group of female teenagers guided us towards the falls. Their spontaneity was infectious!

We got down to the waterfall following a rocky, steep staircase.

Standing before the giant Kudengrim Falls reminded us how tiny we were in front of Mother Nature. Fed by rains of the last couple of days, the waterfall was gushing violently. For the first time during the trip, no one dared to think about taking a dip in the water.

However, we did climb the boulders to have a closer look of the waterfall and captured as many memories as we could. I must admit it was risky and strongly advise against doing such reckless act.

It was getting late and we had to get back to the Bangladesh border in time. A 2 and half hours drive from Kudengrim took us to Dawki land port.

After completing formalities at the border, we enterd Bangladesh with lots of memories.

Travel Notes

To visit Meghalaya, one must have an Indian visa, preferably Dawki selected as the entry port. If the tour is preplanned, both transport and hotels can be booked at reasonable price. But if it is unplanned, there are plenty of options. The whole itinerary for a 4 to 5 days tour might cost within BDT 12,000-20,000 including accommodation, food, transport and others. If your tour involves trekking, you must pack proper clothing and shoes. As most of these places are remote, I would recommend you to hire a professional guide.

654,Around the world on a Vespa: The ‘no-plan’ nomadic life,"For those of us wedded and welded to our routine-ruled existences, there is an almost jealous fascination about people like Vespanda Ilario Lavarra.

And of course, there are many more of us than there are those like him. We are in the vast majority because the human mind seems to have (d)evolved past the age-old practice of nomadic wandering. But a small minority finds richness and something approaching true freedom in the nomadic ways of old.

We take stories like Vespanda's as fantasies. People who have traversed large swathes of the world on bicycles or on foot, or sailed seas alone on sailboats, or gotten on a Vespa almost six years ago, and did not look back. Or maybe they look back, but the desire to look ahead is greater.

Most of the time, these are stories we hear about from others, see on YouTube, read about in travel articles.

This is the reason I travel with my Vespa, because at 60kmph you can escape nothing. You cannot escape from your fears, you cannot escape from the sun, you cannot escape from the rain.

When brought face to face with such an individual, however, the sense of detached wonderment gives way to genuine curiosity, much like suddenly discovering that actual people are enacting the scenes behind the screen of a movie hall in real time, and that along with the glamour, the bruises are real.

When Vespanda was last home in Milan, Donald Trump was still president of the US, the Big Five were a big thing in Bangladesh cricket, Ukraine was only metaphorically in Vladimir Putin's crosshairs, and the term ""global pandemic"" was associated with something that happened a 100 years ago.

Since September 16, 2017, Vespanda has been on his 1968 Vespa and gone to Norway, then down to Spain, down and up the continent of Africa, into Turkey, the middle east, and central Asia. Recently he came to Bangladesh, the 97th country on this most epic of journeys. He entered through Satkhira, and over more than 40 days went to Barishal, Kuakata, Cox's Bazar, Saint Martin's Island, Dhaka, and Sylhet before going back through the capital to Satkhira and back into India.

""I had a degree in economics and worked in an office, but this was not my goal in life,"" Vespanda said during the interview with The Daily Star. ""My goal is to travel as much as I can, enjoy my life as much as I can. So, I put together my two passions -- travelling and Vespas.

""This is the second long journey because 10 years ago I was in the Americas. I travelled for almost two years [on another Vespa that is now in a museum in Italy]. From New York to Alaska, then to Argentina and back to New York again. Twenty-one countries, and 82,000km.

""When I came back from this long journey, I went back to work and I decided, with my savings, I would visit the rest of the world.""

The question was inevitable. What would a ""normal"" person need to do to just start on a journey like his?

VESPANDA Ilario Lavarra.

""The most important preparation is not physical. The most important preparation is mental. Because you have to face a lot of bad situations on your journey. So, if you are not well-trained mentally, at the first problem you go back home. All your values, your comfort zone, you have to forget them. And for sure, at the beginning, to be reborn from zero is not easy at all … you have to change your point of view of the world, you have to change your habits. You have to change yourself. And when you are ready, you say, let's go around the world, it's a beautiful experience.""

But he is quick to remind you that it is not all beauty. There is a lot of pain, both emotional and physical. There is of course the pain of leaving behind friends and family, as well as saying goodbye to friends made on the road.

""This is the most difficult part. To be free … what I read once was, freedom is not free, and that is the point. You have to handle the bonds, you have to handle the good and bad moments, and you have to pay sometimes for freedom.

""I had a girlfriend and we split after I had been on the road for three years. It was 2020, just a few weeks before Covid. It was very painful because I was alone and we had been together for 10 years. But of course, we cannot continue like that,"" the 40-year-old Italian said with the air of someone who had processed the pain, and gotten back on the Vespa.

During the Covid-19 lockdowns, he was stuck in Iran for eight months, then Turkey for another eight. But he only used those times building friendships and delving into local culture.

He also talked about going through countries where there were ongoing conflicts, and the dangers that held -- from travelling through the jungles of Cameroon in 2017 despite being warned by locals that rebels kill people inside the forest every day, to staying in a police station in Yemen for a week because he could go no farther as there was a war going on.

Going through Africa, he contracted malaria in Angola and recovered in Namibia. He suffered from Typhus fever in Guinea.

""I was in Conakry, Guinea. It is one of the poorest countries in the world. I remember I was very sick, in a lot of pain, in a hospital in that little village. It was a hospital without electricity, with chicken going around the room. In Africa, you are not able to say whether you will be alive tomorrow. In the end, this is my philosophy -- this is my day-by-day life.

And so, we come to the real reason he does this.

""But the balance is, every day you have new experiences, you meet new people, you enjoy new food, you feel you are living your life. I always say 'one life, live it'. I will go on, carry on as long as the positive is more than the negative. Till my desire of discovering something new is more than my sadness and pain to leave everything behind.

""I don't want to just see the world. I want to get my hands dirty with the world. This is the reason I travel with my Vespa, because at 60kmph you can escape nothing. You cannot escape from your fears, you cannot escape from the sun, you cannot escape from the rain. That's what I want to live… I want to experience every aspect of this world. This is the reason I am travelling low budget [around 10 to 15 euros per day] with this 50-year-old Vespa that has a maximum speed of 60kmph.""

He said he chose to travel on Vespas also because he has a passion for the two-wheelers, it's easy to make running repairs and spare parts are available everywhere. As importantly, people love the Vespa and its non-threatening presence, and Vespa lovers, like in the Vespa Club Bangladesh, welcome him with open arms.

Perhaps it is this near primal urge to be one with the world he travels through that when asked about the most stunning sights he has seen, he does not come up with obvious answers.

""I love the Iguazu Falls [in Argentina], which are huge, but with more levels and they are very impressive.

""Landscapes in general, I really love Bolivia, or the Tajikistan mountains or even north part of Pakistan. This kind of unique, remote areas where you are in the middle of nature.

""I crossed the desert at night in Saudi Arabia because it was May and it was 50 degrees during the day. So, I spent one night crossing 1,000km of desert. Me alone, this dark sky, with these dunes, and this silence. I remember when I switched off my Vespa, there was an airplane high in the sky and I could hear its engine. No sounds all around me, and it was an amazing experience because you are really in touch with the elements, nature and the world.""

He has also developed a special place in his heart for Bangladesh. ""What surprised me or what I liked most were the paddy fields, it is something unique. Okay, for you maybe it's nothing but for a traveller who comes here and is surrounded by this green ocean of palm trees and these beautiful fields, water, and people dressed in colourful clothes -- these are some of the things that most impressed me.

""And I really loved the tea gardens in Sylhet, and the long beach of Cox's Bazar with these wonderful boats, colourful boats with these strange shapes I have never seen in my life.""

Having already crossed 185,000km on this journey, he plans to travel to Australia, then take a flight to the US before circling back to Europe.

Would he then go back home?

""Mine is a no-plan life. I know this is the most difficult thing for normal people to understand because normal people have schedules from eight in the morning, so you cannot imagine how you can live without a plan. But the only point is you have to live this journey and just follow the flow.""

One can only hope that he continues on this incredible journey where beauty and pain go hand in hand and struggle for primacy, and that the positive outweighs the negative for as long as possible.",2023-03-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-holiday/news/around-the-world-vespa-the-no-plan-nomadic-life-3274131,2023-05-18 10:32:18,thedailystar
655,The Galapagos: The land of evolution,"They say the beauty of the Galapagos can't be explained. It can only be experienced.

When, in November, 2018, my wife Sarmin and I visited these wonderful islands in a 4-day cruise package, I understood it.

The Galapagos Islands is a chain of volcanic islands that sit in the Pacific Ocean about 500 miles off the coast of Ecuador. The islands are uniquely located on both sides of the equator.

The islands' unique ecosystem and endemic animal species draw wildlife lovers from across the globe. These are some of the same species that intrigued Charles Darwin, the noted naturalist, who developed his theory of evolution, in part, by studying the unique fauna of the islands when he visited in 1835.

It's the living laboratory of evolution. As a person, who knows the basic of science, visiting the Galapagos was like a pilgrimage to me.

Thirteen major islands make up the Galapagos chain: Isabela, the largest island; Santa Cruz; San Cristobal, the first island Darwin explored; Fernandina; Santiago; Floreana; Espanola; Marchena; Pinta; Sante Fe; Genovesa; Baltra (South Seymour); and Pinzon (Duncan).

Smaller islands include North Seymour, Rabida (Jervis), Bartolome, and Daphne Major.

Only five of the islands have human populations: Isabela, Santa Cruz, San Cristobal, Baltra, and Floreana. The remaining islands are inhabited only by animals and can only be accessed on guided tours.

The islands are situated at a point in the Pacific Ocean where three ocean currents collide, creating a unique area in the sea where warm and varying degrees of cold water meet. This natural phenomenon creates crystal-clear turquoise water that surrounds the islands and fosters rich marine ecosystems.

In addition, the islands are far enough away from each other that both plant and animal species could not easily migrate, and over time adapted to their environment, with several becoming endemic to a specific island.

Giant tortoises on Isabela, marine iguanas on Fernandina, blue-footed boobies nesting on North Seymour, and 17 other land, marine, and avian species not found anywhere else in the world are the major reasons for the Galapagos Islands' fame.

Marine life in the Galapagos is unlike anywhere else in the world, since 20pc of marine species found there are endemic to the Galapagos.

All flights to the Galapagos Islands must go through Ecuador main land (Quito or Guayaquil). After immigration, a mandatory registration is required to visit Galapagos. From Ecuador mainland, next stop is Baltra Island, which has the sole airport in the archipelago. Here you would need to pay national park fees. From here, we took a short bus ride followed by a short boat trip to arrive at Santa Cruz. We stayed in here for two nights in Airbnb and explored the island.

From Santa Cruz, we explored 4 more islands of the Galapagos. Planning ahead is very important: we booked our all-inclusive cruise 3 months earlier, fully paid in advance. Most of the cruises have to be booked via travel agencies. We used GreenGo.com.

Our cruise was on a catamaran that can host 16 guests in 8 separate cabins, 9 crew members and a guide. There are different categories when it comes selecting a cruise. Ours' was Archipell, a mid-range catamaran. We were happy to have had exceptional service, food, on/off shore excursions.

Although it was a small boat with 16 guests, this may be the best way to explore Galapagos Islands. Downside is the rough sea at night. For those who have seasickness, the Galapagos can be a tough place to visit. However, there are bigger, more comfortable ships available.

Visiting this unique corner of the world, which changed our understanding about the world, will remain as a highlight in my memory lane.",2023-03-03 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-holiday/news/the-galapagos-the-land-evolution-3262546,2023-05-18 10:32:20,thedailystar
656,The yellow days in Hanoi,"The thrilling, yet dangerous Hanoi Train Street. Although most cities don’t have establishments in such close proximity to the train track, one would find many makeshift coffee shops on both sides here. The street is maintained by the local coffee shop owners, who gatekeep access to the street unless you buy a cup of coffee. Two trains run along this route daily, one at 3:30 pm and another at 7:30 pm.

When I visited Hanoi in 2019, I only had a chance to catch a whiff of Vietnam's capital. I took a glance at all the splotches of yellow architecture in awe and had little to no idea how to navigate myself in a town that hardly communicated in English. But even then, Hanoi found a place of eternal fondness in my heart and gave me a gift of familiarity that I couldn't make much sense of at the time.

However, very recently in December 2022, I had the chance to revisit the city's magic, and that too as my mum's personal tour guide.

When we touched down in Hanoi on December 28, 2022, little did we know that we'd be greeted by a heavy downpour. Much like Dhaka, Winter arrives in Hanoi after the rain washes over the city, welcoming a sombre atmosphere.

Water puppet show at Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre.

While there were many things we had adequately prepared for on this trip, the one thing we severely underestimated was how cold it would get. Vietnam's geography is interesting to say the least – the country hugs Laos and Cambodia like an inverted ""C"" and in the north, it gets as cold as an icicle. So it's safe to say that the two moderately warm jackets that we carried didn't quite suffice. But even then, the city had its way to make sure that we would be okay.

After dropping off our bags at a hotel in the city centre, we had a little chat with the concierge, who helped us mark off all the must eat places in the Old Quarter. We had three things on the agenda for our time in Hanoi – eat at the most iconic street food restaurants, book our trip to Hạ Long Bay and put our haggling skills to the test in a foreign country.

But first, we had to exchange money.

Nazifa Raidah is a Sub-editor at The Daily Star. Reach her at [email protected]

Running this errand was an adventure on its own. The thing about Hanoi is that most places that had an exchange money sign outside the shop were run by tour operators who kept a handsome sum for themselves as company commission. While one can respect this move as a standard business practice, it's quite hard to accept when you're travelling on a tight budget. After roaming around the walking district against the cold, gushing winds, we came across a jewellery shop on Hàng Bạc named ""Giang Son Gemstone Jewelry Co"" which also had exchange money signs on the storefront. We decided to try our luck.

Here's a fun fact – in Vietnam, whenever you have to make any sort of exchange, be it to purchase goods or to convert money, you have to adopt a new mode of communication — through calculators. Vendors and shop-owners alike will only communicate with you through calculators and negotiate through gestures. And if they don't like the price you offered, they will simply escort you out of the shop with no further quarrel.

And duly so, the owner of the jewellery shop typed in the exchange rate on a calculator, which was decently above the rate that showed up on Google. Excited, we grabbed the money and set out for lunch to satiate our rumbling stomachs. We planned on having the best Bánh mì in town at the ever famous Bánh Mì 25.

Five shows are held every day of the week.

As we walked through the streets of Hanoi, clenching onto a broken umbrella with our dear life, I noticed that all the street names started with the word ""Hang"". Later, I figured out that the streets in the Old Quarter are all named after what they sell. The previous street we went to, Hàng Bạc, stood for ""silver street"" in translation. Similarly, there's Hàng Da ('leather street'), and Hàng Ca ('fish street'), among many others.

When we finally reached Bánh Mì 25, the smell of mulled wine, dominated by notes of sweet cinnamon, had engulfed the whole street. The restaurant was quaint with stools to sit on inside. The kitchen was situated on the opposite side of the road and a huge line had followed its opening. After a considerable wait we finally had our hands on the ever famous snack.

The night market on New Year’s Eve, filled with tourists and locals bidding adieu to the year.

Bánh mì, a Vietnamese sandwich, has a rich history that reflects the blending of French and Vietnamese cultures. During the French colonial period in Vietnam, baguettes were introduced and quickly became a staple food. To appeal to local tastes, Vietnamese street vendors started filling the baguettes with a variety of ingredients, including meats, pickled vegetables, cilantro, and chilli sauce.

There are certain bites of food you always remember for the rest of your life. A taste you crave, sitting a thousand miles away. This bite was one of them in my life. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, this bread is unlike anything you've ever had. The meat was tender, with flavours that came in with a punch, and a glass of chilled passion fruit juice on the side — what more could one ask for? And the best part? Each Bánh Mì cost us around Tk 135 and the fresh juice cost Tk 113.

Sung Sot (Surprise) cave, the largest and one of the most beautiful caves in Ha Long Bay, located on Bo Hon Island.

With our stomachs filled and our hands back to normal temperature, we set out to book our tour to Hạ Long Bay. We were warned beforehand by previous visitors not to get the tour booking done from the hotel as they're often way over price. And what they said checked out. The minimum cruise tour to Hạ Long Bay costs around USD 64 to USD 100 at hotels, depending on how luxurious you want your tour to be. But if you're the type that wants a comfortable trip to the Bay just to witness its beauty, you can get deals outside for USD 24.

And so, the next day, the tour bus picked us up from the hotel and we were off to witness one of the seven wonders of the world. When I visited Hạ Long Bay in 2019, I was quite disappointed to see that due to the influx of tourists, some parts of the Bay's water seemed murky and I even found a few plastic bottles floating here and there.

My mother and I, smiling through the exhaustion of going up the stairs to catch the magnificent view of the bay behind us.

However, this time around I was impressed at the government's initiative to keep the tourist spot in tip-top shape. Before getting down the bus, the guide warned us not to take any plastic bottles, since if anyone is found carrying one, tour operators would have to give a fine of ₫ 500.000, which is Tk 2,300, per person. And so, this time around, I found the jade waters completely crystal clear and fitting to the description of the myths that it carried.

According to local legend, the bay was formed when a dragon and a fairy descended from the mountains to the sea, and the dragon began to spit out jewels and jade, creating thousands of islands and islets in the process. The fairy then blessed the area, causing the rocks and islands to turn into stone, and the dragon continued to live in the bay, creating powerful currents and winds to protect the area from invaders.

This legend is often told as an explanation for the stunning beauty and unique geology of Hạ Long Bay. The area is known for its thousands of towering limestone cliffs and caves, which have been shaped by wind and water over millions of years.

The infamous Bún cha, a traditional Vietnamese pork dish at Bun Cha Huong Lien, where Anthony Bourdain and President Barack Obama had shared a meal, popularising the dish to the world in the process.

After witnessing what was perhaps one of the most memorable sunsets of our lives on an open deck, Mum and I headed back to Hanoi. We paid a visit to Cafe Giảng, famous for their egg coffee, all the while awestruck at the beauty we witnessed. As the bustle of the night market unravelled in the streets, I found myself sitting with that familiar yellow warmth of Hanoi, yet again.",2023-02-17 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-holiday/news/the-yellow-days-hanoi-3250886,2023-05-18 10:32:21,thedailystar
657,Lobhachhara and the great Nanka,"In late October 2021, my quest for documenting tea-planters' graves around the country brought me to Looba Cherra tea garden.

Some of you may find my quest odd, but that's what I love to do. Teacher by profession, my life's quest is now to travel and discover the heritage sites of Bangladesh. Since 2021, my search for the tea-planters' graves has taken me to many corners of the Sylhet division. After two years of travelling and documenting, I thought my work is done.

I was wrong. Recently, my cousin Professor Dr. Mohammad Shariful Huda informed me that there might be more graves of tea-planters in the Looba Cherra tea garden in Kanaighat.

And I needed no second push to set out for Sylhet.

In Sylhet city, most people knew Looba Cherra tea garden, but no one knew about the graves. Unlike other scenic areas of Sylhet, Lobhachhara, which has a breathtakingly beautiful landscape, remains a less travelled tourist destination.

The name Lobhachhara, for an unknown reason, rang a bell in my heart – a special feeling that I might have developed over the years travelling around the world. Something told me inside that the trip would be special.

Lobhachhara tea garden in Kanighat upazila of Sylhet is located adjacent to the Indian border. There are a few ways to reach there, but, unfortunately, none of them is very vehicle friendly.

An iron suspension bridge built in 1925.

And from Kanaighat, the hilly and unpaved road to reach the tea garden makes normal vehicular movement almost impossible, even in the dry seasons. Unless you have a four-wheel-drive vehicle, motorcycles and some three-wheelers are your only hope.

A four-wheel-drive vehicle of the Lobhachhara teas estate.

Reaching Sylhet from Dhaka, my concern was how to get permission to enter the garden. Though I am not a huge fan of social media, it came out as my rescuer. Finding the Facebook page of the Looba Cherra Tea Estate, I sent them a message stating my purpose of visit.

A prompt reply from the page surprised me. To be honest, as my experience taught me, I wasn't expecting much. Not only that, the admin of the page, Yunus Osman, gave me a clear idea how to reach there and also provided me with an emergency contact number.

That was a good start, I thought. However, I had no clue about the surprises awaiting me there.

On the way to Lobhachhara

Eliza Binte Elahi has so far visited over 50 countries across the globe. Eliza, who teaches at the University of South Asia as an adjunct faculty, considers herself a history and heritage lover.

Leaving the hotel early in the morning, I took a bus ride to Kanaighat, which is around 55km from the city. You can go there by CNG-run three-wheelers too. But I opted for bus as it gives me an opportunity to interact with locals. It wasn't a joy ride. The road, at some places, was quite bumpy.

Reaching Kanaighat, considering my options, I choose the boat ride, which I found to be the most popular transportation means for locals, to reach the tea garden.

Asking locals, when I reached the ghat next to the Kanighat market, there were several boats on the Surma river. One can hire a boat or share a trip with locals. Fed by the water of last couple of day's heavy downpour, the Surma was flowing with grace. Locals told me that they mainly travel by boat to destinations along the river during the rainy season as the river remains navigable. But in the late winter, the Surma at some places loses its navigability, especially in the upper stream, forcing them to take the roads.

June Ferguson

I opted to share the ride. When I asked the boatman to drop me at the Lobhachhara tea garden, I found that the locals were calling it Nanka's tea garden.

I wish the boat ride lasted longer! As the boat journey progressed, the beauty of the river and the lush greens and life around it changed. At every curve, the river offered something new!

June Ferguson grave.

The boat turned left from the estuary of Surma and Lova rivers and our journey progressed through the Lova, probably one of the shortest but most scenic rivers in the country. Locals claimed, during the dry season, the stone-bedded, crystal clear river takes an even better look. Coming through the enormous mountains in India, the beauty of Lova, they said, demands a visit by every nature lover.

The Khasia-Jainta Hills in the northeastern border of ​​Bangladesh is the source of a number of rivers in Sylhet. Among them, Jaflong, Bisanakandi on the Piyain river attract huge tourists. The Lobhachhara is one such place on the Lova, but less trodden.­

After 40 minutes, the boat stopped at a ghat. The boatman informed me that I had reached my destination. Getting off the boat, a few minutes' walk it took to reach the gate of Lobhachhara tea garden. While introducing myself to the security guard, Yusuf Osman came to welcome me.

Lobhachhara Tea Estate

James Ferguson, father of Nanka.

Inside the 1840-acre British-era tea estate, it felt like the outside world had little to do with its proceedings. The idyllic tea plants, the apparent lack of activities and the postcard-like background of mountains gave me the feeling that time had stopped there!

Osman escorted me to the residence of the owner of the estate, James Leo Ferguson. After going uphill on the rocky road, my eyes widened to see the old thatched bungalow. Last I saw this kind of structure in Japan's Niigata city. It was 200 years old.

The magnificent bungalow in the tea estate was built in 1876. Old jeeps, British-era switch boards, lamp shades, wooden cupboards, old photos – there were plenty to watch around.

Donald Ferguson

Meeting the great Nanka

""How are you, Eliza? Welcome. I am James Leo Ferguson, a freedom fighter of the Liberation War of Bangladesh.""

As I turned to the source of that heavy, deep voice, I saw a tall handsome man looking at me with smile. I wasn't quite ready to meet Ferguson.

I went to the tea estate in search of graves of tea-planters. I had no idea how many surprises were waiting for me there.

As I visited the family cemetery of Fergusons, I found the grave of June Ferguson, the first woman tea estate manager of this subcontinent.

British writer John Radford wrote the only book about Sylhet's tea-planters' graves. This information was missing in his book.

June Ferguson is the mother of James Leo Ferguson, the only Bangladeshi freedom fighter of Scottish origin.

The experience I gathered in conversation with the Scottish-origin fierce Bangladeshi was priceless.

Ferguson, who was born in the same bungalow where we were talking while having tea, said they were originally from Scotland and Fergusons had a family tradition of joining wars. His great grandfather Donald Ferguson had fought in World War I. Then his grandfather James Arthur Ferguson fought for the British army in World War II.

Arthur Ferguson

He said his family also had a history of working in tea estates. After the World War II, James Arthur Ferguson retired from the army and joined Isabella Tea Estate in India. Later, June Ferguson, daughter of Arthur, became the manager of Lobhachhara tea estate, which was bought by the family.

Immensely proud as a freedom fighter, Ferguson's affection for his family, especially for her mother June Ferguson, the woman who inspired him to join Bangladesh's Liberation War, was evident.

""I participated in the Liberation War with the inspiration of my mother. I fought in sector 4. My sector commander was Chitta Ranjan Dutta,"" said a beaming Ferguson.

Kanaighat, from where the boat journey started.

After Bangladesh's liberation, he joined local politics. He was elected chairman of Lakshiprasad Union of Kanighat several times, serving the people for 17 years. That's why locals affectionately call him Nanka.

The conversation was fascinating. In fact, there were so many topics to discuss – the history of the tea estate, June Ferguson, Liberation War. He affectionately showed me the collection of his family photos, including that of June Ferguson and his ancestors.

In the midst of all this, I also met Mukta, a 40-year-old pet elephant of Ferguson. It seemed the animal could understand its owner as it greeted me after Ferguson's verbal instruction.

What was meant to be a short trip, ended up being a whole day experience with Fergusons. Ferguson's sister and her family were living in the bungalow. I met everyone -- Yusuf Osman, Yunus Osman, Jesse Ferguson, and Ira Ferguson. Though Ferguson's wife and children are living in London, his love for the land kept him at Lobhachhara.

Nanka, who can speak eight languages, showed his driving skills too when he drove me to Kanaighat by his four-wheel jeep through the hilly dirt road.

As an unknown guest, it was overwhelming to receive so much love.",2023-01-27 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-holiday/news/lobhachhara-and-the-great-nanka-3232506,2023-05-18 10:32:22,thedailystar
658,Dzo Zongo East Mission accomplished,"Why do you climb? Why do you risk everything over scaling a summit?

For the last decade, I have been continuously bombarded with such questions. At first, I tried to answer just like legendary mountaineer George Mallory did in 1923: ""Because it's there"". However, I have learnt the hard way that my answers won't satisfy everyone. Now I don't bother anymore.

It is okay if no one understands you. Well, maybe I am not being honest with myself. These questions, sometimes, come to my mind too. Facing hard choices on the high mountains, doubt does creep in.

19 September 2022, was one such day.

Practising alpinism in the Himalayas is one of the most liberating experiences one can have. There's no one to help, no one to guide you. Your destiny lies within your hand. You make a mistake and you're gone.

We were in the Markha Valley of the Western Himalayas located in Hemis national park of Ladakh, a mostly high-altitude frozen desert nestled between the Himalayas and Karakoram. We chose this part of the Himalayas for our expedition, not only for its high-altitude giants but also for its spectacular landscape. The deep-rooted Tibetan culture of the region was a bonus.

We, my partner Imran Khan Ozil and I, were there to climb four high-altitude peaks -- Kang Yatse II (6254m), Dzo Zongo East (6214m), Regioni Mallai Ri- I (6120m) and Conga Ri (5755m) -- in just ten days as part of the GoZayaan Expedition Ladakh expedition.

We departed Dhaka on September 4 and arrived in Leh, the capital of Ladakh, the following day. After obtaining the required permits and logistics, we started the trek towards Markha Valley on September 8 and two days later reached our first base camp, located at an altitude of about 5100 meters above sea level.

After summiting Kang Yatse II (6254m) and Regioni Mallai Ri- I (6120m) respectively on September 12 and 15, our next goal was to scale the 6214m-high Dzo Zongo East.

Salehin Arshady is an explorer, mountaineer, youth activist and writer. He has climbed and documented all the highest peaks of Bangladesh over 3000 feet and explored many trekking routes in the Indian and Nepal Himalayas.

Should we attempt to climb Dzo Zongo again? There were other issues at hand too. If we attempted, could we return to Leh in time to catch our return flight back home? And most importantly, did we have enough energy left in us for another attempt at a six-thousander?

On 18 September 2022, we were able to establish our third basecamp, all thanks to our superhuman porters Ajay and Aman, a duo from Kishtwar Kashmir. We started our summit push just after midnight. If successful, it would be our third six thousander within a week. As you can assume, we were pumped. We hiked up to 5500 meters in mere three hours.

Out of the blue, Ozil announced that he couldn't feel his toes. I immediately decided to go down. The mountains are a demanding, cold place, and they don't allow for mistakes. Ozil was hesitant at first but followed me. We were leaving behind a golden opportunity to climb three six thousanders in a row! Our hearts sank as we knew how close we were to completing a unique feat. We knew that our expedition was over.

When we were back at the bank of Nimaling Chu River, the sun was already up. The ethereal sunrise of the Himalayas failed to lift our spirits. Ozil was restless the whole time. He couldn't quite accept the decision to abort the climb midway.

After resting for a while, he was constantly insisting that he was feeling better. He also put on an extra layer of socks in the meantime.

Suddenly he offered, ""as we couldn't climb Dzo Zongo let's try Konga Ri (5755m)"".

And guess what, we crossed the river and started climbing again. Ozil summited Konga Ri at around noon while I took a nap just below the summit point. And when we got back to the base camp, the clock had yet to hit 3:00pm. We had our dinner with Dal Bhaat and put our exhausted bodies into the warmth of sleeping bags.

After sunset, Ozil's restlessness infected me. Should we attempt to climb Dzo Zongo again? Ozil's toe seemed okay and he was feeling a lot better. But there were other issues at hand too. If we attempted, could we return to Leh in time to catch our return flight back home? And most importantly, did we have enough energy left in us for another attempt at a six-thousander?

Ozil was adamant to give it another try. But I was sceptical. The weather forecast wasn't promising, and we had a flight to catch. If we attempted, it had to run smoothly.

Then a crazy idea popped up: what if we start our summit bid after sunrise, thus we could avoid the cold at night and move fast in the daylight? It was an insane idea. No one starts the summit bid of a Himalayan six-thousander this late. Under sunlight, melting glacial ice and loose rocks most likely would make the route more difficult and riskier. Too many questions and we didn't have any answers.

We climb mountains for various reasons. But personally, it's the sense of freedom that I find in alpinism that drives me most. Practising alpinism in the Himalayas is one of the most liberating experiences one can have. You carry all those things you need to survive in those harsh conditions in a backpack. There's no one to help, no one to guide you. Your destiny lies within your hand. You make a mistake and you're gone. There's none to blame, none to thank but you!

The expedition's fate was hanging by a thread and I made up my mind.

At around 10:00pm, I told Ozil that we would make another attempt on Dzo Zongo, and this time we would start after sunrise. And surprisingly, that night I had the best sleep of the entire expedition.

At 6:00am, we had some coffee and started again for Dzo Zongo east, the 6214-meter giant. Without any tiredness or trouble, we reached the glacier snout. And to our utter disbelief, we found ourselves at the wrong glacier.

First, I felt anger. How could we make such a mistake? The route was well-defined and it was hard to miss! Then, I was sad. Another attempt to go in vain! We sat there for around half an hour to calm our nerves down. Should we retreat?

We were so close to our goal! The choice was easy. I told Ozil that if we move fast, we can make the summit before sunset. Ozil didn't need any pursuing. So we hit the trail towards the top, once again.

It was not easy. Now there were two glaciers that we had to cross. The first glacier was short and the gradient was relatively easy. We put our crampons on and traversed the glacier to reach the eastern flank. Then we descended to the second glacier. This one was huge and full of crevasses. Ozil hesitated for a while but followed me eventually. After an arduous climb, I was able to reach the ridge and soon started for the summit. That ridge was very peculiar. Defying the high wind, there were giant blocks of rock along the whole ridge, making the summit a little more challenging.

At around 4:30pm, we were on the top of Dzo Zongo East. Our five-year-long dream finally came true.

As with all the Himalayan peaks, the view from the top was stunning. However, we had to move fast as the weather was showing signs of trouble. We started to descend without wasting time.

But it worsened sooner than we anticipated. It started snowing heavily and within minutes, it was a complete whiteout. As our visibility reduced to mere 10 feet, we lit our head torches and followed one another. At the mid ridge, my GPS watch stopped working. That forced us to use all the skills we mastered from previous Himalayan experiences to reach our tents at around midnight.

With all the misfortunes and troubles, we could climb three six thousander Himalayan peaks in a single expedition. And that is satisfying!",2023-01-13 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-holiday/news/dzo-zongo-east-mission-accomplished-3220501,2023-05-18 10:32:23,thedailystar
659,Two six thousanders in two days,"Salehin Arshady is an explorer, mountaineer, youth activist and writer. He has climbed and documented all the highest peaks of Bangladesh over 3000 feet and explored many trekking routes in the Indian and Nepal Himalayas.

It was easier than we anticipated.

After scaling Kang Yatse II (6254m), the hardest of the 4 summits we planned to scale as part of the GoZayaan Expedition Ladakh, we were pumped. Many teams attempting Kang Yatse massif in the recent past from Bangladesh have struggled to ascend this giant.

So, when it was done with relative ease, we thought the rest of the expedition would be easier. How wrong we were!

It was 3:00pm, September 13, 2022. After more than 15 hours of hiking, scrambling, and climbing in the high altitude, we were back at the base camp, exhausted. To fulfil the expedition's goal to climb four high-altitude peaks -- Kang Yatse II (6254m), Dzo Zongo East (6214m), Regioni Mallai Ri- I (6120m) and Conga Ri (5755m) -- in just ten days, we had no time to lose.

We were in the Markha Valley of the Western Himalayas located in Hemis national park of Ladakh, a mostly high-altitude frozen desert nestled between the Himalayas and Karakoram. We chose this part of the Himalayas for our expedition, not only for its high-altitude giants but also for its spectacular landscape. The deep-rooted Tibetan culture of the region was a bonus.

Our next goal was to scale the 6120m-high Regioni Mallai Ri.

Ozil and I initially planned to shift the base camp immediately to save a day. The new base camp would be only a couple of kilometres from our present one. It would be a couple of hundred metres higher too, at 5300 metres.

However, packing the tents proved to be a gruelling task. Abandoning the plan, we took refuge in the warmth of our sleeping bags.

The next morning, on the 14th of September, we packed all our belongings and headed towards the Regioni Mallai Ri base camp. Trust me, packing the base camp of a mountaineering expedition is not an easy task. We had to cook our breakfast, clean all the utensils, dismantle the tents, and repack everything accordingly in our backpacks. With only half of the atmospheric oxygen present in the air to breathe, doing all these little tasks wasn't easy.

After more than 15 hours of hiking, scrambling, and climbing in the high altitude, we were back at the base camp, exhausted. To fulfil the expedition’s goal to climb four high-altitude peaks -- Kang Yatse II (6254m), Dzo Zongo East (6214m), Regioni Mallai Ri- I (6120m) and Conga Ri (5755m) -- in just ten days, we had no time to lose.

It took us nearly two hours to repack our things, and another three hours to climb up to the base camp of Regioni Mallai Ri. After setting up the tents, we again went back into our sleeping bags. At midnight, we would set off for our second six thousander. Two six thousanders in two days!

Just two days back, when we started for Kang Yatse II, the full moon flooded the earth, helping the summit push. But this time, thick black clouds covered the moon, enveloping the whole valley in darkness.

We started to climb up the moraine slope just west of our base camp. It was actually a giant hump. We moved quickly, reaching 5500m. Just after reaching the top of the hump after two hours, at around 2 am, it started snowing.

The white weightless snowflakes were coming down from the dark sky and sparkled like a diamond reflecting on the beams of our headlamps. It was a sight to behold.

As the snowfall was getting heavier, visibility became an issue and forced us to assess the situation. According to our map, we were getting closer to a ridge which leads to the summit. So after discussing the pros and cons, we decided to go ahead without wasting time.

It was a large boulder zone. There were some humps of rocks which were almost 20-30 metres in height. We traversed a couple of those and could finally see the ridge which was supposed to lead us to the summit.

But in the darkness, the ridge didn't fully reveal its secret. After advancing for another three hours in snowfall, I was feeling very cold. My toes were getting numb. We could see the ridge but were not sure whether it would lead us to the summit or not. We decided to wait for the sun to rise. In the mountains, taking unnecessary risks can be fatal.

We were again fortunate enough to witness one of the grandest sunrises from the lap of the Himalayas.

The divine sunrise boosted our spirits. Finally, we could clearly see the whole ridge that connects to the summit itself. But what we saw came as shock. Just before the summit, the ridge was broken. That means we could not just follow the ridge up to the summit. We need to revise our route completely.

Ozil and I shared our views and unanimously decided to bypass the broken part. For this, we decided to negotiate the ridge first, then we would climb down to the glacier below where the ridge is broken. After covering the broken part, we would climb up through a connecting ridge to the main ridge.

It was supposed to be an easy climb. We were at 5800 metres, merely 300 metres below the summit. It was merely a thousand metres away!

The descending part from the ridge through the loose rockfall zone proved to be harder than we anticipated. A moment's lack of concentration or a single mishap could have resulted in a few hundred-metre fall on hard rock. We were not mentally prepared for that.

Again we took a break, calmed our senses and started to go down again. When we hit the glacier, we were at 5500 meters. That means we had to climb more than 600 meters.

We moved with extra caution over the glacier. It took us about half an hour to cross the broken section.

And the hardest part waited for us after that. We had to go up through an untested, steep path. Apart from loose rocks, the area was covered with thin ice, making it trickier.

It took us around 5 long hours to climb the rest of the slope. At around noon, we stood on top of 6120m Regioni Mallai Ri.

We were tired and exhausted. But the reward from the peak was outstanding. A great panorama from the summit could be seen, especially the Kang Yatze massif and the hidden parts of the Dzo Jongo peaks and their glaciers. A moment like that is worth all the pains and pangs of an expedition.

We descended to our camp safely.

Packing the tents proved to be a gruelling task. Abandoning the plan, we took refuge in the warmth of our sleeping bags.

Scaling Regioni Mallai Ri taught us a hard lesson: no objective in the mountains is easy.

Our overconfidence almost pushed us to potential harm. You can't be restless in the mountains. To traverse the hidden dangers of the high mountains, one needs to be calm. With calmness comes clarity, which is essential for making sound, potentially life-saving decisions. And then there's your grit, endurance, and never quit mindset – the qualities you develop over time.

This successful ascent to Regioni Mallai Ri boosted our confidence once again, and now we were ready to tackle Dzo Zongo Twins, the last two peaks to complete our challenge.

That story is coming up in the next chapter.",2022-12-23 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-holiday/news/two-six-thousanders-two-days-3203621,2023-05-18 10:32:25,thedailystar
660,Kang Yatse- II : The journey begins,"It was a cold night in mid-September. The thick darkness was so depressing that I switched on the red light of the headlamp. The gentle dim light illuminated the tiny space inside our yellow tent making the gloomy atmosphere somewhat comforting.

At least the frozen darkness was not suffocating anymore.

The day before yesterday (September 10, 2022), Imran Khan Ozil and I, the two-member GoZayaan Expedition Ladakh team, arrived at the base camp of the 6254-meter-high Kang Yatse- II peak.

Our goal was to climb four high-altitude peaks -- Kang Yatse II (6254m), Dzo Zongo East (6214m), Regioni Mallai Ri- I (6120m) and Conga Ri (5755m) -- in just ten days.

We were in the Markha Valley of the Western Himalayas located in Hemis national park of Ladakh, a mostly high-altitude frozen desert nestled between the Himalayas and Karakoram. We chose this part of the Himalayas for our expedition, not only for its high altitude giants but also for its spectacular landscape. The deep-rooted Tibetan culture of the region was a bonus.

We departed Dhaka on September 4 and arrived in Leh, the capital of Ladakh, the following day.

After obtaining the required permits and logistics, we started the trek on September 8 and two days later reached the base camp, located at an altitude of about 5100 meters above sea level.

Although we wanted to push the summit last night, we decided to wait a day due to bad weather. A Spanish team of two attempted the climb yesterday amid gusty winds and heavy snowfall. This morning, they returned devastated.

Earlier, in the evening, by seven, we slipped into the warmth of our sleeping bags after dinner, waiting eagerly sleep. A few hours of sleep was needed before we started our summit push. The plan was to wake up by eleven, get dressed, and leave the tent before the clock hit twelve. The alarm was set accordingly. But my biological clock wasn't.

Right next to me, Ozil, my partner in crime, was lying cocooned in his sleeping bag. There was no way to know whether he was asleep or not. The eerie silence, the anticipation, the excitement, the freezing cold, the fear of uncertainty…. these all kept me awake. All my attempts to calm down my hyperactive brain failed.

The moment finally arrived. I turned off the alarm before it could go off. Ozil also sat up at the same time. First, I lit the gas stove and put water on it for coffee. While waiting for the water to boil, we covered ourselves with down jackets, waterproof trousers, and balaclavas to face the brutal cold outside.

The black coffee felt good. It was nice to have something hot down your throat in such weather. We were about to set off for nearly twelve to fifteen hours of climbing in such tough conditions. The caffeine would come in handy.

It wasn't midnight yet. Slipping on our climbing boots and shouldering the summit bags, we headed out of the tent. It was time.

Stepping outside, I realised how strangely the human mind works. Though the difference was negligible, the inside of the tent felt much warmer. No matter how tiny, rough or uncomfortable it is, a home or shelter instantly provides a sense of security. Going away from that shelter, temporary or permanent, has the opposite effect. Overcoming that ambivalent state of mind and taking the first step defying all the odds sometimes prove to be the hardest part of any expedition.

We took that step.

Though it was supposed to be a full moon, the cloudless sky was sparkling with stars. A gentle breeze was blowing. Apart from a flapping sound of a loose rain flyer in a tent of a nearby expedition team, the valley was in a deep sleep. We could only see the shapes of other basecamp tents in the star-lit night.

The weather was perfect for the summit push. But mountains are unpredictable and the weather there can change in no time.

Slowly, we passed the very last tent at the end of the valley and started to climb up through the popular western slope of the mountain. Far above, the shape of a stupa could be seen. That would be our first stop.

In this part of the rugged world, the local people erect stupas by piling stones which work as a guidepost. It is primarily a Tibetan practice, but all parts of the Himalayas now follow this to navigate easily. Within an hour we reached there. Then we saw another stupa above and started climbing in that direction. As we approached the second stupa we came to a ridgeline.

Then an ethereal thing happened.

From the south, a huge, rust-yellow moon peeked out from behind the high mountains. The pale buttery yellow light radiating from the moon reflected upon the snow-white massif of Kang Yatse and lit up the entire valley. Turning off the headlamp, we both sat in awe for a while.

After some time, thanking nature for this spectacular view, we again started climbing.

From 5400 meters, we found snow on the trail. After another hour, around 3:00 pm, we reached the crampon point. Now we had to move through a steep snow field. We set the crampons with the boots tightly. I tied gaiters so that the snow could not get inside the boots.

The journey resumed again after a short coffee break.

After a few steps, we were surprised to find the snow was loose, fluffy and deep. We trudged the trail through this slushy, knee-deep snow for an hour. After climbing for another 400 meters, we encountered another amazing cosmic event.

The sight of sunrise from a height of almost six thousand meters is always dramatic. It doesn't matter how many times you have experienced this, it's bound to move you, each time. The riot of colours on the towering peaks and sky, the illumination of the vast valleys before the first rays hit the earth, are bound to astonish you. The enormity of the mountains in that sacred moment should make us all feel what we are- a tiny part of this nature.

While all these were happening, we noticed a headlamp was approaching fast towards us. To our surprise, the path which took us three long hours, the owner of the lamp climbed in just half an hour. It was Dorje Ji, the lead Sherpa guide of an Indian team. Dorje profusely thanked us for breaking the trail so far. He also praised our courage to attempt the mountain in alpine style.

While waiting for the Indian team, we shared snacks among ourselves. After a while, the team emerged below tied together in a rope for safety. After a little discussion, considering his strength and expertise, we decided to follow the rest of the trail behind Dorje Ji.

Meanwhile, the Indian team reached the shoulder. After a little rest, the team started climbing the ridgeline's last part. And we followed. After another hour of trekking, we reached the summit of Kang Yatse-II at 12: 08 pm. We all celebrated the moment together.

But the journey was half-done and we had hours of descent ahead.

The descent was uneventful but mesmerizing. Perhaps it was the thin air, but everything seemed beautiful. To save some time I glissaded down to the crampon point. It was rather unconventional, may be a little risky, but very effective. The three hours climb just took 15 minutes!

At around 3:00 pm we reached our tent. This time falling asleep wasn't the problem. After a good meal, sleep came crashing on us. Our bodies needed rest as the challenge wasn't over. We were all set to scale two more six thousanders in the coming days.

661,Debotakhum where tranquillity reigns,"Bandarban is the ultimate destination for travel and adventure lovers in Bangladesh. With a relatively unspoiled mountainous landscape, the district offers various trails to trekkers for hiking through tropical jungles and valleys.

The district also hosts several khums -- the indigenous Marma word for natural water reservoir -- deep inside the mountains. These khums serve as the much-needed water source for the people around the area. The beauty of these khums also attracts tourists willing to take the challenge of trekking.

This story is about my visit to Debotakhum, one of the most beautiful khums in Bandarban. Locals also call it ""Sonakhum"" and ""Thongchikhum"". Located in Roangchori Upazilla, the khum is approximately 600 feet long and, according to locals, nearly 50-70 feet deep. This remote khum is situated between rocky hills, which rise vertically over 100 metres adding to its beauty.

There are several exciting myths among the locals about Debotakhum. According to one myth, once an old Marma man saw a gigantic turtle in this reservoir. The unnatural size of that turtle made him believe that it must be a debota (a Bengali word meaning god) who was residing in the khum disguised as a turtle. The locals still believe that their god is somewhere in Debotakhum.

It was 2020. After being locked up at home for 8 months due to unprecedented Covid restrictions, I, like most people, was desperate to breathe fresh air. In October, the government relaxed the lockdown for 2 months. And it was the opportunity I was looking for to break up the monotonous routine. More than ever, I was eager to go close to nature. I wanted to breathe fresh air, walk in the woods, and hike through the mountains.

After some discussions on probable destinations, my sister and I opted for Debotakhum, a place where I visited before. On my first trip, there were so many tourists that I couldn't feel the silence of nature. And I was also travelling with a group.

So, this time, we decided to go by ourselves. One fine morning, we packed our bags and boarded a bus bound for Bandarban from Chattogram. We were a bit concerned because we had never travelled ""alone"" before. But the concerns couldn't prevent us from a sound sleep on the bus.

We got off the bus around 9:30 and called a local guide. But the news we heard was disappointing. More than 100 tourists were visiting that place that day.

As we were determined to enjoy the serenity of nature, we decided to wait a day. We spent the rest of the day visiting nearby tourist spots in Bandarban such as Meghla, Nilachal and Ruposhi Jhorna.

The next morning, we started early for Roangchori. The hired four-wheel-drive jeep locally known as Chander Gari was on time. It took us about an hour to arrive in Roangchori Upazila. With a form in his hand our guide, Ohainu da, was waiting for us outside the police station. We filled out that form and went to give it to the police officer.

""Are you sure you guys can go there alone?"" the officer inquired as he quickly skimmed through the application. We both immediately nodded, and we were given permission. Once more we got into Chander Gari with Ohainu da. Kocchoptoli was our next destination.

The Chander Gari ride was an adventure by itself. The roller coaster ride through the zigzag hilly roads was worth the risk. It was just 10:00 am when we reached Kocchoptoli. Following a little breakfast, we proceeded to take the mandatory permission from the army camp and faced the same question: ""Can you two go alone?""

We came this far for nothing and replied affirmatively with confidence. But this time the permission came with a clause. Our guide was ordered to return by 5:00 pm.

From here the walking trail starts. After a short walk, we arrived at a Marma bazar, from where the trail takes two routes: one is hilly, and the other goes along a jhiri (small stream). As it rained heavily the day before, we choose the steep route. Since we were hiking up a steep trail in the sun, it wasn't enjoyable at first. After going up for a while, the trail became somewhat bearable. As the number of trees grew, a soothing shade enveloped us. A cool breeze was blowing and our ears were soothed by the sounds of the mountain.

After a few minutes, the atmosphere got eerily quiet as we moved deep inside the reservoir. The narrow waterway between steep hills was blocking most of the sunlight, creating a mysterious realm of light and shade. It almost felt like an adventure. All we could hear was silence except the chorus of insects and the splashing of waters made by our paddles.

We arrived at Shilbandha Para after one and a half hours of trekking. The residents in this tidy neighbourhood (para) were quite friendly. While relaxing in a loft, a smiling old face caught my eye. I tried to talk to her but she didn't understand a single word and kept smiling. Saying her goodbye, we departed for Debotakhum, which was merely a 10-15-minute walk from the para.

There were few tourists that day, so we got a near-empty khum. My sister and I boarded a bamboo raft which Ohainu da managed in advance. He also joined us on another raft.

After a few minutes, the atmosphere got eerily quiet as we moved deep inside the reservoir. The narrow waterway between steep hills was blocking most of the sunlight, creating a mysterious realm of light and shade. It almost felt like an adventure. All we could hear was silence except the chorus of insects and the splashing of waters made by our paddles.

I lay down on the bamboo raft in the middle of the reservoir, looking up at the sky as the icy water touched my skin. I'm not sure if there was a debota (God) there, but I found what I sought: tranquillity.

The sun was sinking. We had to return even though we didn't want to. We arrived at the army camp around 4:00 pm. While leaving, I told the army officer, ""see sir, we did it alone and safely."" He grinned.

Our Chander Gari was waiting and took us to Bandarban. That night we returned home to Chattogram.

How to go:

After reaching Bandarban by bus or car, you can hire a Chander Gari to Kocchoptoli.

Expenditures:

We had to spend approximately Tk 3,000 each. This trip from Chittagong can be managed for Tk 1,500 for a day trip and Tk 2,000 if you want to stay a night.",2022-11-18 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-holiday/news/debotakhum-where-tranquillity-reigns-3173291,2023-05-18 10:32:27,thedailystar

What about a few days out of network, away from the hectic city life, amidst nature and lovely people? Do you want to experience such solitude and peace?

I recommend you to visit Nafakhum, the site of one of the country's largest and most beautiful waterfalls. And if you think you will be spending your time and energy only to see a waterfall, you are wrong. The journey to this khum (natural water reservoir) will pay you more than you expect, guaranteed.

In July this year, I visited this remote place in the hilly Bandarban with five of my friends.

Since 2020, we decided to visit places that require trekking at least once a year. Last year, we went to Marayong Thong in Alikadam, Bandarban. And this year, it was Nafakhum.

After a whole night's journey, we reached Bandarban from Dhaka around 4:00 am. From there, we took a 4-hour bus ride to Thanchi.

As we reached Thanchi late and there was not enough time for making the trip to Remakri, we stayed the night at a resort. The sunset views from Thanchi Bridge were stunning.

In the morning, we hired a boat to Remarki. The boat journey through the Sangu River was thrilling as well as rewarding. Everything we saw on both sides of the river seemed rightly tuned by nature. And it got better as we progressed. The high hills on both sides of the river became greener, the air got crispier. The opportunity to see the lifestyle of indigenous people in close quarters was a humbling experience.

On our way to Remakri, our guide showed us two significant sites: Boropathor and Remakri Falls. Though the river looked harmless near Thanchi, the boat ride after Tindu became challenging.

Our boatman had to turn off the engine for half an hour to have a better hold of the boat while crossing that part of the bumpy, fast-flowing, boulder-strewn river. It was almost like rafting!

It also took away the mechanical sound, the only annoying part of the ride, and allowed us to emerge in the solitude of nature.

Though the name Boropathor refers to a giant rock, the river at that point had several large boulders.

Remakri falls were not the regular falls one can imagine. It is one of those distinctive falls where water streams through steps of rocks made by flowing waters over thousands of years.

An interesting fact was that whenever we encountered any local villagers on our way to Remakri, every single one of them waved at us with a big smile. It was so heartwarming!

We reached Remarki, a union of Thanchi Upazila, after around two and a half hours.

The three-hour-long trek to Nafakhum started from there. However, it might take less than three hours for seasoned trekkers.

Honestly, the trek was quite challenging. But the pleasant gestures from the indigenous people and the stunning landscape gave us the fuel to complete it. Whenever we came across a local shop, the shop owners offered us water and fresh fruits!

We reached Nafakhum a few minutes before sunset. As it was mid-July, the roaring waterfall above the khum was stunning.

The fall is on the Remakri canal, a tributary of the Sangu River. Here the wild canal suddenly falls down about 25–30 feet.

In the rainy season, Nafakhum can be accessed by boat from Remakri.

Tourists must hire a local guide from Remakri. We hired Larma, a 19-year-old charming man, who arranged for us a cottage in Jinapara, the village of indigenous Marma people, right by the waterfall. We stayed there for the night.

The people living in the para were humble and cooperative. Even though tourists like us were kind of infiltrating their regular lives, they did not complain or show us any sign of irritation, not even once. We, who visit there, should not be the cause of any inconvenience to them.

There was no TV, no mobile phones, and no network there. But there was a big moon hanging in the sky full of stars. Without any notifications popping up on our mobile screens, it felt like we were living somewhere outside of our known world.

That night, amidst friends and nature, will always be dear to my heart.

We started our trek back to Remakri early in the morning and got back to Thanchi around 1.30 pm by the same boat we hired.",2022-11-04 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-holiday/news/memorable-journey-nafakhum-3160846,2023-05-18 10:32:29,thedailystar
663,American Wilderness A Climb in the Rockies,"Boulder Field and the Keyhole on the way to the summit of Longs Peak.

It was around 11:45 in the morning.

The bright clear sky now started to signal worrying signs as some ominous black clouds were gathering in the corner. My friend Sabbir and I were standing at the foot of a 200-foot vertical rock wall called the ""Homestretch"", the last obstacle between us and the summit of Longs Peak, a 14,259-foot (4346 m) mountain located in the Colorado Rockies. We were almost exhausted due to 9 hours of hiking, scrambling, and climbing at the high altitude.

A quick but tough call had to be taken at that point – a call which could potentially be the difference between life and death, and we made the wrong choice.

The clouds were growing every moment, and so were our worries. The thunders were rumbling, the wind was roaring, and the melting ice was making the Homestretch more slippery than ever!

The Longs Peak with its infamous diamond face, considered the most iconic mountain of Colorado.

And in the midst of all of these, I slipped from that wall…

A mountain with an altitude of 14,000 feet or around 4,300 meters is not that impressive if you compare it with the Himalayas. But here in the States, it is a pretty big thing.

There's not even a single summit in the USA (excluding Alaska) that reaches the height of 15,000 feet. Naturally, the excitement about these mountains among the hikers is super crazy.

The Homestretch is an around 200 feet near vertical wall close to the Longs Peak summit.

It's kind of justified too. Unlike a trek or climb of similar altitude in the Himalayas, you can't find a village along the trail; you can't even camp in many of these mountains because of the over-complicated rules and permit systems. You can't find a porter or a cook to help you with your loads even if you are ready to pay a good sum! You are completely on your own once you start your trek, which makes scaling these mountains comparatively more daunting a task.

Moreover, a very long summit push with a lofty elevation gain is very common. For example, our summit push for Longs Peak was 12km one way with an elevation gain of around 5,000 feet, which would probably be done in 2-3 days on a standard Himalayan trek of the same altitude. No wonder climbing such a fourteener, a mountain that is at least 14,000 feet high, is considered somewhat of an achievement within the trekking community.

So, out of sheer necessity, Alpinism is practised in the right way here.

With the great Rocky Mountains as its spine, Colorado is truly a paradise to any wannabe mountaineer. Not only does the state have stunning mountainous landscapes, but it alone also has more than half of the highest mountains in the continental US.

Those attractions drew us to Colorado, from Tennessee, which was a 22-hour drive. We planned a week of expedition eying to scale three of the fourteeners.

Miraculously, after sliding just 15-20 feet, I managed to grab onto a rock edge preventing my name from being among the victims of this majestic mountain. Cuts on both of my hands were the only price I had to pay.

Longs Peak is considered the most iconic mountain in Colorado. It is also the mountain with the highest death toll. At least 374 trekkers and climbers have lost their lives trying to scale this mountain. The iconic and notorious Diamond Face of it is responsible for most of the deaths.

We chose Longs Peak, the hardest among the three, first to save us from some extra 7 hours of driving. Coming from almost sea level, an acclimatisation day before the actual summit push was planned. We decided to trek to a nearby alpine lake named ""Sky Pond"" so that we could hike up to an elevation of around 12,000 feet and then come back to sleep at our campsite at a lower elevation of 9,000 feet.

The Sky Pond with the Sharkstooth Ridge in the background.

That day was extremely gloomy; the stunning view of the infamous lake with the Sharks Tooth ridge in the background on a day full of whiteouts and hailstorms was the only bliss!

We started our summit push for the Longs a couple of hours after midnight. Afternoon thunderstorms often start from around noon almost every day in the alpine Colorado and death by lightning is not very uncommon. So climbing anywhere above the tree line after midday becomes an extremely risky business. We planned to reach the base of the mountain around sunrise and then climb to the summit in a couple of hours so that we could descend well below the tree line before noon.

But we were dangerously running behind the time.

Sabbir (red jacket) and I during the expedition.

Not sure whether it was the lack of acclimatisation for my Covid-affected lungs or the sprained ankle from the last backpacking trip to Virginia that slowed us down. When we reached the boulder field at the base of Longs Peak, we had only two hours to summit and climb down, which seemed unlikely.

But the weather looked perfect. The bright sunlight was flooding down the clear blue sky and there was not a single trace of any threatening cloud!

In these circumstances, we decided to move ahead. We would go up as much as possible but with the slightest change in the weather, we would stop our push and come back to safety.

After the keyhole - an extraordinarily beautiful carved rock after the boulder field, there were four more regions. ""The Narrows"" and 'The Ledges"" were less challenging. It was ""The Trough"" where things began to get complicated.

The Ledges section of the Longs Peak mountain.

The mountain was in its worst icy condition – neither the snow was as deep and hard as it would be in the winter/spring nor was it melted completely. Almost every rock there was covered with layers of thin ice making the climb way harder. The crampons could not bite the snow properly without breaking the ice.

In some places, we had to move ahead creating our own way, avoiding the standard route. Ultimately, after more than one and a half hours and crossing these three sections, we came to the Homestretch.

Just about 200 feet between us and the summit!

However, the excitement was short-lived. The weather suddenly worsened. The blue sky was darkening fast, a thunderstorm was looming.

Sabbir and I had a small debate at that point about whether we should go ahead ignoring the risk or should we forfeit the summit push despite being so close! Though the Homestretch is only 200 feet in height, it is almost 90⁰. One needs to be extra careful here. After a brief argument, we agreed to take the risk.

Lots of thoughts were in my mind – the time, the threatening clouds, the difficult descent ahead. And that momentary lack of concentration almost proved to be fatal!

I was trying to climb faster than usual and had that fall, losing my foothold. At that moment of weightlessness, an inexpressible chill ran through my spine knowing that at least 30 feet of fall on solid granite would shatter my body.

Miraculously, after sliding just 15-20 feet, I managed to grab onto a rock edge preventing my name from being among the victims of this majestic mountain. Cuts on both of my hands were the only price I had to pay!

It took us another thirty minutes to climb to the top and there was hardly any time for a breather. The dark clouds hovering over our heads now looked more ominous.

There was not another soul on the summit; the last person we met left about half an hour ago postponing his push, from just below the Homestretch. According to him, he was wise enough not to take the risk of being fried by Zeus's bolts!

He also tried to persuade us to go with him. It's a shame we didn't bother.

We could sense the static electricity in the air; even the marmots were afraid, rushing towards any hole they could find for shelter. Though both of us didn't express it that time, deep inside we were scared as hell and had nothing to do except pray for luck.

Fortune again took our side as we found a tiny cave under a boulder in time before nature unleashed a severe hailstorm with intense thunder and lightning.

We remained trapped inside that cave for almost two hours until the storm ended. And finally, when we were back at the trailhead, a total of 17 hours had passed!

After Long's, we summited two more fourteeners on the trip -- Mt Elbert, the highest peak of Colorado and the second highest in the continental US and Huron Peak. Though easier compared to Long's, they were spectacular, especially Huron. With its insanely beautiful alpine meadows and the magnificent 360⁰ view of the whole Swatch Range, Huron was a treat to the eyes. Traversing its long, exposed ridgeline amid intense wind gusts was fun too!

Though nothing much happened in those mountains to tell, we needed that pleasing beauty and peace after such a day in the Longs. We returned home after passing just a week there, but the memories of the mountains of Colorado are still super fresh and alive; as they will be, at least until the next adventures we are planning in the mountains of Wyoming.",2022-10-21 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-holiday/news/american-wilderness-climb-the-rockies-3148986,2023-05-18 10:32:30,thedailystar
664,Kashmir a heaven on earth,"After passing the passports and tickets to an immigration officer at Dhaka airport, I was lost in thoughts reflecting on the last couple of years. Though the worst days of the Covid-19 pandemic were over, the stagnant, restricted life was still vivid in my memory.

How we all yearned for a pandemic-free world of unrestricted travelling!

A benign cough from the immigration officer brought me back to the present. ""Hello, Covid vaccine certificate please, ""he asked, reminding me of the post-pandemic ""new normal"" rules.

During the pandemic, like many, I too had planned many trips in my mind. An opportunity came during the long Eid-ul-Fitr vacation and, my wife and I took it. We were at the airport for a three-day trip to Kashmir.

We reached Delhi after a two and half hour's flight. We grabbed a quick meal utilising the 2 hours before our next flight to Srinagar.

Delhi to Srinagar was a 1.45-hour flight and an hour into it, Kashmir started to reveal its glamour and grandeur through the window. The views of the majestic Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas from above were superb.

At the parking lot of the airport, Ferdous Bhai, our tour guide and driver, was waiting for us with a smile on his face. To our surprise, he could speak little Bengali.

The beauty of the spring season in Kashmir kept our tired eyes open throughout our two-hour journey to Pahalgam, where stayed for the night.

Located about 100 kilometres from Srinagar, Pahalgam, the jewel of the picturesque Liddar Valley located in the high Himalayas, is famous for its scenic beauty. By the time we reached there, it was already dark. After dinner, we had a walk in the near-empty local market.

The next morning, on ponies, we set out for Aru Valley. 12 kilometres from Pahalgam, many consider this place the most beautiful of all the tourist spots in the area.

We enjoyed the pony ride on lush meadows surrounded by mountains with snow-capped peaks and pine forests.

However, by the time we reached there, the weather turned gloomy and soon, it started raining. This apparent setback was a blessing in disguise. We enjoyed the rain with cups of warm tea. It was wonderful.

Our next destination was Betaab Valley, another popular location among tourists and even Kashmiris, previously known as Hagan Valley. The renaming of the valley happened after the shooting of a hit Bollywood film called Betaab there.

The entire setting was very scenic with the Lidder River flowing right next to it. With crystal-clear turquoise water, the beauty of this fast-moving river is hard to describe.

Unfortunately, we were not permitted to approach Chandanwari, a tourist spot 8 km further away from Betaab Valley, as landslides, a common incident during the early spring season, triggered by rain blocked the road.

That day, we left Pahalgam and reached Srinagar, where we stayed for the night. Our next spot was Sonamarg, which is approximately 80km away from the summer capital of Kashmir.

The presence of the Indian military was noticeable in Sonamarg as it was near the Kargil, a focal point of the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan. However, other than facing a few regular security checkpoints on the way, we didn't face any adverse situations.

The journey to Sonamarg, a gateway of the ancient Silk Road that connects Kashmir with China, became a pleasure trip as Ferdous Bhai from his driving seat recalled all the famous movies which were shot on this road.

After reaching Sonamarg, situated at an altitude of 2730m with huge Himalayan Mountains in the backdrop, we decided to trek towards Thajiwas Glacier.

It took us almost three hours to trek to the glacier site, enjoying a few moments there and coming back. In the evening, we returned to Srinagar and spent some time at the night market nearby our hotel to collect souvenirs.

On the next morning, we started for Gulmarg which means ""Meadow of Flowers"". Gulmarg crowns the world's highest golf course and is also a popular destination for skiing.

We hired a local guide and rented ponies to get to Snow Point, where we enjoyed a sledge ride. While returning, we stopped at factory outlets to see how famous Kashmiri pashmina shawls were made.

We returned to Srinagar that night.

Our stay in a houseboat at the Dal Lake in Srinagar was the tour's highlight. With a touch of luxury, we loved our stay at the floating house. We experienced a tranquil, surreal sunrise at Dal Lake.

Later in the morning, we hired a Shikara (boat) to explore the lake. We also embarked on a sightseeing tour in and around Srinagar and enjoyed some Kashmiri cuisines like Wazwan, Kashmiri Biryani – which were distinct in taste and colour due to the presence of indigenous spices.

On the final leg of the trip, we did some quick shopping and then started for the Srinagar airport.

Soon, a sense of gloom engulfed us. Many call Kashmir heaven on earth for a reason.

How to go there: One can go to Delhi by bus, train or air given that you have an Indian visa.

Expenditures: The three-day trip of two cost us around 150,000 BDT.",2022-10-07 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-holiday/news/kashmir-heaven-earth-3137896,2023-05-18 10:32:31,thedailystar
665,Nilgiri: the land of clouds,"It was a chilly Thursday night in Dhaka. We, my mom and I, were waiting to board our bus, and I was panicking. My uncle, aunt, grandma, grandpa, and a younger cousin were running late for the 11:15 pm bus. And it was already 11:05 pm.

I was relieved when I noticed them on the other side of the street. I frantically waved my hands at them, hoping they would see me.

Luckily, they did.

At last, we all boarded the bus to Bandarban, where we would stay two nights at the Nilgiri Hill Resort.

I slept for most of the 6 hours journey. When I woke up, it was morning.

After arriving in Bandarban, we went to a restaurant for breakfast. I would be honest here; I didn't enjoy it. The parathas were too cold. After that, we took a car ride to reach the resort.

The three-hour journey was spectacular. As our car moved along the scenic road, the different shapes of mountains and clouds were a treat to my eyes.

We reached the resort around 11:00 am and went to our respective rooms. After unpacking my bag, I went to my uncle's room and was astonished by the view from his verandah.

The surrounding green hills, the meandering Sangu River at the bottom and the moving clouds were a spectacle to behold.

Soon after, we had lunch. The menu was chicken salad, bamboo chicken, lentil soup and rice. I went for bamboo chicken and rice. My tongue got blistered eating that tasty but excessively spicy food.

We all spent the evening sitting on the verandah enjoying the views. My mom and aunt served us snacks and tea. We ate freshly collected bananas too.

However, at dinner, I hardly could eat. The welcoming aroma of the local cuisine was mouth-watering, but my blisters prevented me from tasting the delicacies.

After dinner, we had a memorable walk around the resort. The soft moonlight lit everything around us, including the clouds surrounding us. It was, as if, we were walking inside the clouds!

It was cold outside, but the touch of the wet clouds was soothing.

And the clouds were moving fast. In one moment, they were encircling us; the next moment, they were far gone to another mountain.

The rest of the night went pretty well despite my encounter with a giant spider. But that's a different story.

On the second day, we went to the helipad. The greenery, the white clouds over the valley, the crisp air – all made that sunny day magical.

From the Nilgiri hilltop, I could even see lighthouses and ships in the far Bay of Bengal using my uncle's monocular.

We spent the rest of the day exploring the resort and taking pictures. It was so windy that the thought of wind turbines came to my mind. Surely, the turbines, if installed there, would produce enough electricity to power the resort or, at least, part of it.

The wind was stronger during the night. I had to wear a blanket to even go to the verandah. There, I saw two gigantic lizards just outside my room. I confess I was not a fan of the bugs in this place. Every insect there was ginormous!

Apart from a few incidents with the bugs and insects, I enjoyed the rest of the trip. The views there would stay with me for a long time. It was one of the best experiences I ever had. And this could be your next family vacation place too.

How to go there: You can go to Bandarban by your own car or by bus. From there to Nilgiri, you can hire a jeep. You can also go to Chattogram by air then take a bus or hire a car to Bandarban.

About Nilgiri Hill Resort: If you want to touch the clouds, Nilgiri is the place to visit. The resort, on the Nilgiri Hills, is maintained by the Bangladesh Army. It is about 45 kilometres away from Bandarban district headquarters. My uncle and aunt had access to it as they served in the army. You must book at least a month before to get a room in this coveted resort.",2022-10-07 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-holiday/news/nilgiri-the-land-clouds-3137806,2023-05-18 10:32:32,thedailystar
666,Amazing Zhangjiajie Exploring the Avatar Mountains,"Shiful Alam, an engineer by profession, is a travel enthusiast. He has done some high-altitude trekking in India and Nepal. He has visited 18 countries so far.

Located in the northwest corner of China's Hunan province lies the sandstone marvel of Zhangjiajie, part of the greater Wulingyuan Scenic and Historic Area where peculiar rock spears rise high above the forest ground.

I wanted to visit this place after watching James Cameron's Avatar. The film's computer-generated imagery of the alien land was based on the iconic sandstone spires of Zhangjiajie National Forest Park. It is also known as the Grand Canyon of China.

This park also has the world's highest outdoor elevator, the longest cable car, and some terrifying cliff-hanging glass walkways. All these attractions make Zhangjiajie a unique travel destination for thrill seekers and nature lovers.

Let me share with you the experiences I had during my 3-day Zhangjiajie trip just before the Covid pandemic.

After landing at Zhangjiajie Airport in the middle of the night from Guangzhou, three of my friends and I spent the rest of it in a hotel in the city centre. Early morning, we left for Tianmen Shan or the 'Heaven's Gate Mountain. Tianmen Mountain, which is only 8 kilometres from the city, stands tall at about 5,000 feet.

We took the cableway from the city centre. The 25,458-foot-long world's longest cableway gains 4000 feet on its way to the mountain.

The half-hour cable car journey was simply breathtaking. We witnessed a spectacular sunrise. We saw the famous 99 Bends Road winding up the mountain underneath us. The 360-degree views of sky-high rock pillars and the forest's lush green beneath were magnificent.

When we reached our destination, it was covered in light fog. The misty, mysterious environment momentarily made me feel I was in Pandora!

Tianmen mountaintop is girdled by a daredevil walkway suspending at 4,700 feet above sea level. While most of it is made of concrete, one 200-foot-long part has floors made of see-through glasses. We had a good time roaming around and experiencing an adrenaline-filled walk on the cliff-hanging walkway and skywalk.

Next, we visited the Tianmenshan Temple. This temple, built in 870 AD by the Tang Dynasty, is located on top of the mountain offering a panoramic view of the valley. It claims to be the Buddhist centre of Western Hunan.

Our next site was the ""gateway to heaven"", a natural cave which is the main tourist draw of the area. To see it, we had to descend. On the way, we discovered one of the craziest things: escalators. Yes, they did build escalators into the mountain to transport people quickly and comfortably up and down. I suppose you can only find these in China!

At about 5,000 feet above sea level, Tianmen Cave is the highest naturally formed arch in the world.

To reach the landmark, visitors must walk up 999 steps on the ""stairway to heaven."" Nine is a lucky number in Chinese numerology, representing good fortune and eternity.

The cave itself is about 430 feet tall and 190 feet wide. It used to be a fairly ordinary cave until the year 263 AD when one side of the mountain's cliff collapsed and created the portal to heaven.

After taking the escalators and descending the 999 steps, we arrived at the bottom of Tianmen Cave. The view of the staircase and the inexplicable hole in the mountain is hard to explain in words.

We returned to Zhangjiajie city using the ""99 bends road"", which, as its name suggests, has 99 sharp bends, and is one of the most picturesque mountain roads in Asia.

In the evening, we left our hotel for Wulingyuan Scenic Area. Hotels with basic amenities are available inside the park. We checked in at a hotel and spent most of the night exploring the area.

The next morning, we went to the National Forest Park ticket station around 7:00 am as it gets busy later in the day. We took a bus from the entrance National Park'. It dropped us on the foot of the Bailong Elevator, recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's tallest outdoor lift.

Bailong Elevator is the most convenient way up to Yuanjiajie Scenic Area to see the Avatar Mountains. It took only 1 minute 28 seconds to reach the top of the 1076-foot-long elevator shaft. Otherwise, it might take around 3 hours to reach the mountain top if you choose to hike.

After reaching the upper station, we walked to Yuanjiajie Scenic Area, where dozens of foliage-covered vertical stone columns rise into the sky. This unique lanscape inspired the floating Hallelujah Mountains of Pandora in the film Avatar.

After spending some time there, we took the sightseeing bus to Tianzi Mountain, which provides stunning views of peaks. It is known as the Monarch of the Peak Forest. At the top of the mountain, visitors can see the full extent of the Wulingyuan Scenic Area.

The whole area was formed by sedimentary rocks 318 million years ago. Those rocks, eroded by the water and wind, slowly turned into quartz stones and formed those peaks in the scenic area.

Later, we took the cable car to get down to the park entrance. We went back to our hotel in Wulingyuan to spend the night.

The next morning, we went to the Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon by taking a coach from the Wulingyuan bus station to experience an unforgettable walk.

Imagine walking through the clouds on a bridge with a glass floor nearly 1,000 feet (980 feet to be exact) up in the air while you can see the deep canyon under your feet! I bet you will think twice before setting foot on it.

It took a lot of courage to step onto the Zhangjiajie Glass Bridge, the longest and highest glass-bottom bridge in the world when it opened in 2016.

The 1,410 feet long bridge is inside Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon, which takes about a 40-minute ride from Wulingyuan.

With alien-looking mountains, rivers, and caves, this whole area looked like a charming landscape painting. The fresh air, emerald-coloured lake, and green mountains along with its rich biodiversity will surely make you feel connected with nature.

After crossing the glass bridge, we took 2300 feet long Sky Ladder Plank Road to get down. The slope of this wooden stair is very steep and narrow, so you will need strong legs to take on this path. However, you surelywill miss the beauty of the path if you take the zip line.

At the bottom of the valley, a wooden path alongside a quiet and clear stream will welcome you. The serenity around while walking there will amaze you for sure.

Later, we visited popular sites like the Momo Cave, the Holy Spring Lake and more while appreciating the stunning and well-preserved natural beauties.

The last place we visited was Baofeng Lake, a turquoise-coloured water body surrounded by graceful mountains. It is an artificial freshwater lake created in the 1970s by building a dam. At the lake, you can take a boat ride to feel relaxed after hiking in the nearby mountains.

With alien-looking mountains, rivers, and caves, this whole area looked like a charming painting. The fresh air, emerald-coloured lake, and green mountains along with its rich biodiversity will surely make you feel connected with nature.

We took a city bus to go to our hotel. We had to leave for Beijing at night.

I have to admit that, so far, I haven't seen anything like Zhangjiajie. It's simply otherworldly.

It doesn't matter how many times you have seen pictures of this place. Once you visit the area, you will be amazed, guaranteed.

When to go

The best time would probably be to travel between November and April. This time ensures clear weather, though the temperature might be a bit low (around 8°C). From my experience the best month is April. Must Ignore Chinese Holidays.

How to go

Option 1: You can take a high-speed train from any major city in China to Changsha. Then take a train to Zhangjiajie city (about 6 hours).

Option 2: you can fly from Dhaka to Guangzhou (as we did). Then take another flight from Guangzhou to Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport.

Expenditures

Going in a group saves money. The 3-day trip, inclusive of all costs, may cost you around 70,000 BDT each person.",2022-09-23 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-holiday/news/amazing-zhangjiajie-exploring-the-avatar-mountains-3126801,2023-05-18 10:32:34,thedailystar
667,"Boi Para, Rain, and the Smell of Old Books","The tale of an evening in Kolkata

My uncle and I stepped onto the cracked pavement in front of our hotel with some apprehension. The weather was less than ideal – the heat oppressive, the humidity stifling – our experience of venturing out in Kolkata alone was next to none.

Being avid readers, we ventured out into the city with a SIM card, purchased the previous night from a dubious shop in an alley that can only be characterised by its extraordinarily narrow size and conspicuous smell of urine, and the data package it came with, forming the backbone of our confidence for taking off in this strange city.

The first stop on our adventure was to be College Street, locally known as Boi Para. With uncertain footsteps we approached the battered, yellow taxi sitting idle at the end of the street. The taxi driver was standing in front of his old Ambassador Classic, chewing a betel leaf with gusto. Seeing us come over, he rose out of his stupor and enthusiastically agreed to take us on.

Contrary to the decrepit exterior of the vehicle, the interior was spacious and clean, and, adopting a hurried pace, the driver pulled the taxi into the crawling stream of traffic. He took us to our destination in appreciable time by utilising the obscurest of paths, the knowledge of which only came from spending his entire life on the roads of Kolkata, he assured us. All the while he engaged us in the enthralling, and oftentimes dramatic, history of his family, dating back to the partition.

Thus, it was in good humour that we set foot onto Boi Para. Much like Nilkhet, the footpaths were lined with rows upon rows of hawkers selling any number of books from any number of genres. Behind the signs calling for discounts on medical and engineering books lay small stores specialising in vintage books, both academic and non-academic.

Beside Percy Bysshe Shelly's Selected Poems, bound in a rich green leather rugged with age and use, sat a brand new copy of The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood in yellow print. The shelf below was decorated with Agatha Christie and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, all the volumes being in some form of decay. It was bizarre, but the kind of bizarre that can only be considered endearing and loveable.

Burrowing deeper into the heart of Boi Para, we encountered shops upon shops of old books, each with their own individual character. Novels and books of poetry, mathematical theory and old editions of Reader's Digests – these shops boasted of carrying nearly anything and everything. The shopkeepers beckoned us at every turn, enticing us with the low prices and attractive collections. My uncle and I are individuals of weak resolve, and it was only after burning a heavy hole into our wallets that we decided to seek out a taxi for a ride back after the sun had long set.

The Bangali nature in us prompted us to complain and our sweat drenched state was our chief concern. However, our complaints of the extreme heat were answered by the taxi driver with, ""Now is the time for pujo. Rain is waiting just around the corner.""

Perhaps invited by his words, the sky seemed to break apart into pieces and send down its answer to the mockery of the earth's heat in the form of torrential rain.

Surrounded by the familiar smell of more old books than either of us needed to buy, the tang of petrichor and the comfort of knowing that an Eden such as College Street exists, we made our way across the City of Joy in a 50 year-old yellow taxi that will likely last 50 years more.

668,Chadar trek: walking on a frozen river,"It was a cold January night in Delhi. As I boarded the first flight to Leh, the night was about to end.

Right at the break of the dawn, our plane entered the airspace of Ladakh and I got to witness a alpenglow right before my eyes. The pinkish hue was paving the path for the morning sunshine, making the snow-capped mountains glitter like gold.

Finally, it's happening! My dream of walking on a river is about to become a reality.

It started about four years ago after watching a documentary on Zanskar, a region that lies in the middle of the Trans-Himalayas.

The documentary showcased the serene beauty of some of the unexplored terrain of the area. It showed the difficulties encountered by the villagers during the winter months when snow closes high mountain passes that connect the region with the outside world.

Salehin Arshady is an explorer, mountaineer, youth activist and writer. He has climbed and documented all the highest peaks of Bangladesh over 3000 feet and explored many trekking routes in the Indian and Nepal Himalayas. He lives by exploring unknown territories and with his writings unearth stories that inspire humans to consider their relationship with nature.

However, it also showed how the Zanskaris have mastered the art of finding their way through the apparently impassable landscape. The documentary was so inspiring that I began to dream about this beautiful trek.

Thanks to Travelers of Bangladesh (ToB), the largest travelling group in the country, the dream finally was about to materialise. All the admins especially, Anika, Rabby bhai, Foysal bhai and Mreedul bhai worked hard to make all the necessary arrangements. And here I was, so close to living my dream.

In the Zanskar valley, a fierce emerald green-turquoise river runs through towering mountains and meanders through deep gorges to join the Indus River in Ladakh. During winter, sub-zero condition freezes over the river, forming a thick slab of ice over it.

Locals call it 'Chadar' or blanket. For ages, they have mastered the art of travelling through this perilous Chadar to reach the city to sell yak cheese and fur and return to the village with essentials like salt. Even small children risk this long and dangerous journey from different villages of Zanskar valley to go to school in other places in Ladakh.

I was in Leh, the biggest town in Ladakh, to trek this historical trail.

The trek is across an ancient route that used to be a part of the Silk Road. On the Frozen River trail, you also have the opportunity to visit and stay in remote Ladakhi hamlets, interact with the locals, and experience from close quarters a way of life that has not changed in hundreds of years.

We stayed four days in Leh to acclimatize and explored the city. Ladakh's architecture, art and culture are deeply influenced by Tibet. Numerous ancient Buddhist monasteries scattered all over this Indian Territory are still maintaining that unique heritage.

On the fifth day morning, we -- five of us from Bangladesh, our guide, and porters with all the equipment -- started the journey in a small tourist bus. Our destination was a small village called Tilat Sumdo on the banks of the Zanskar River.

After a three-hour drive from Leh along the Kargil highway, we reached Nimo. This is where the Zanskar River meets the Indus River. After around half an hour's drive from there, we reached our destination.

I set my feet on the frozen Zanskar River for the first time after descending 200 feet from the road. How to describe it? I could hear the angry roars and vibrations of the fast-flowing river under my feet. It was thrilling as well as scary.

As soon as I started to walk over the ice, I realised that it would not be an easy task. The heat of the sun had melted the outer layer of ice making it extremely slippery. I had to waddle like a penguin to reach the other side of the river.

By the time, we reached our first campsite after an hour's trek, I somehow learnt a way to walk on the thin ice. We pitched our tent on the bank next to the river. Far away from the locality, a long winter night fell in the great void surrounded by towering mountains.

The next morning we went out after breakfast of pancakes and Kargil's famous salty tea. We had to cover a long distance today. Our destination was Shingra Kongma, more than 10 km away.

After entering Ladakh, it was the coldest night of the whole trip. The temperature was minus twenty-five degrees. Even after putting on all the clothes, I couldn't bear the extreme cold. I don't think I've ever waited so eagerly for the sun to rise.

After walking for a few hours, the river suddenly narrowed causing the ice slabs to break up to be floated away by strong current.

We had to leave the river a few times and move forward through the steep hills. Not an easy task to say the least. In some places, we had to crawl over very narrow and thin ice channels that had accumulated on the side of the mountain.

The hollow sound while walking on the newly deposited surface was frightening. With every step, it felt like the ice would break and I would fall into the cold river.

The next day, our destination was Tibb and we had to cover 12km. After walking for a while, we entered the kingdom of frozen waterfalls. This part of the entire trail was the most beautiful. It was as if a wicked sorcerer had frozen everything by magic.

One of these waterfalls comes out of a cave in the middle of the mountain. Ladakhis believe that this waterfall descends directly from Manas Sarovar.

Then we came to the narrowest part of the river. Just as our river Sangu narrows towards Andharmanik, the width of the Zanskar River here was only 8 feet. After crossing this place, we reached our destination 'Tibb'.

A huge cave was found about twenty feet from the river bank. We camped inside. At night a huge fire was lit in the mouth of the cave. We had a sound sleep after a feast with rice and roasted tuna inside the warm cave.

The final destination of our trail was Nerak, an ancient village on the banks of the Zanskar River, 12 km from Tibb. The trek was fairly easy as the ice cover on the river was quite thick.

Close to our destination, we saw Nerak ice fall, one of the largest on the route. We could see a wooden suspension bridge across the river. Ahead was a wide valley covered with white snow, lined with juniper trees. The view at this point was breathtaking.

There are two or three stone houses right on the bank of the river. Trekkers come here and stay overnight. The main village of Nerak is about 2000 feet above the river bank. We took shelter in one of the stone houses.

After entering Ladakh, it was the coldest night of the whole trip. The temperature was minus twenty-five degrees. Even after putting on all the clothes, I couldn't bear the extreme cold. I don't think I've ever waited so eagerly for the sun to rise.

The next morning, the sun rose and dispelled the cold spell like magic. It was our reserve day. After a while, we went to see the village, a cluster of stone houses, above.

At the entrance of the village, there was a huge prayer wheel (Dharma Chakra) covered with a canopy. We could hear the sound of music from far away.

Reaching the village, we got to know a festival was going on that day. Everyone in the village had gathered on the open balcony of a two-storey stone house. A few were playing Ladakhi songs with drums and flutes. The young men and women in the village were dancing in rhythm to that tune. The villagers greeted us warmly. In no time we were one of them, dancing and singing.

We felt very lucky to observe Zanskar culture so close.

Walking across Zanskar was a different kind of spiritual experience for me. It would have been nice to stay here for a few more days. But we had to start our return journey the next day following the same route.

When to go:

The Chadar trek takes place during the months of January and February. However, the ice becomes stable enough for walking safely usually by the third week of January. We completed the round trip in seven days. But you can throw in a couple of days more if you want to explore this area.

How to go and expenditures:

Direct flights connect New Delhi to Leh, and travel agencies will usually arrange to pick you up from the airport, drop you off at your hotel, and then drive you to your trekking site. Each of us had to pay around 60 thousand for the trip. Expenditures will vary depending on the group size and the amenities you will have during the trek.",2022-09-09 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/star-holiday/news/chadar-trek-walking-frozen-river-3115596,2023-05-18 10:32:36,thedailystar
669,Mystical Spiti Valley: A road trip to remember,"We rented a car, which we booked from Bangladesh, for the trip. The rent was 4,000 rupees per day including all costs. You can make the trip by HRTC bus service too.

Saim bin Mujib is a traveller, trekker, actor and journalist. He has been trekking for the last 11 years in Bangladesh, India and Nepal. He has recently summited Mount Kanamo and planning to do more.

Do you want to have a travel experience that is spiritually rich as well as full of adventures in the solitude of mountains?

Well, going to Tibet is off-limits for most of us. And yet there are places like that mystical land which can be easily accessed.

On my recent month-long trip to Himachal Pradesh in India, I travelled through the Indian Himalayas, breathed in the ancient mystical air of unique Indian-Tibetan Buddhist culture and summited Mount Kanamo (5,970 metres).

However, this story is about the 9-day-long 1800 km Spiti Valley road trip I took with two friends.

Whenever it comes to Himachal Pradesh, the first thing that pops up in mind is Shimla or Manali. But there are places in this hilly Indian state that might force you to rearrange your travel bucket list.

One of the options may be a tour through the famous Spiti Valley near the Tibet border. Surrounded by the great Himalayan giants, this vast barren land of rocks -- also known as the cold desert -- might offer an experience you will never forget.

Moreover, this trip usually starts and ends in Shimla or Manali, providing you with the opportunity to enjoy these tourist hotspots.

Strongly influenced by Tibetan culture, the valley is completely different in terms of landscape, food, and lifestyle from other Himalayan regions.

The popular route to go to Himachal Pradesh is to go via Delhi. The options were taking a Dhaka to Delhi flight or going there by road through Kolkata. I dropped both and took an Indian domestic flight to Delhi via Agartala, saving some money and time.

After arriving in Delhi on May 10, I felt the heat in my bones. However, Delhi was just a transit, and on the night of May 11, we boarded a government-operated HRTC bus to Shimla, but not before seeing the Red Fort and Jama Masjid.

The next day, we reached Shimla at 9:00 am and boarded a pre-booked hotel. We stayed in Shimla for two days.

The actual journey, the Spiti Valley road trip, began on the 14th.

We rented a car, which we booked from Bangladesh, for the trip. The rent was 4,000 rupees per day including all costs. You can make the trip by HRTC bus service too. However, this bus trips will deny you the opportunity to stop over and visit attractive places.

Several ancient gompas or monasteries, lakes, the world's highest post office, highest suspension bridge, highest motorable village and many more exciting places lay beside this long, high-altitude route. I am sure you would not want to miss these attractions to save some bucks!

On the first day, we went from Shimla to Sangla, a 214 km journey through a thick pine forest which took around 8 hours. Our driver told us that this forest was the densest pine forest in the world.

On the way, we ate fresh cherry fruit from a nearby garden. However, we did miss the famous apples of Himachal. We were too early there for the delicacies. The harvesting season begins around October. There were many apple orchards on both sides of the road, on the slopes of the mountains.

In the evening, after reaching Sangla, a town in the Kinnaur district, we checked in at a hotel called Apple Pie. I had to unpack my down jacket as the temperature was hovering around 5° Celsius. The next morning, snow-covered mountain peaks reminded me that I was in the Himalayas. It was hard to check my emotions as I saw the white mountains after three difficult years. I was grateful too, as I remembered the dark Covid-19 pandemic days.

Our destination for the next day was Chitkul, the last Indian village near the border of Tibet. The 22-km-journey from Sangla took an hour and a half. The beautiful road was sculpted in the mountains. We reached Chitkul at noon, which was at an altitude of 11,300 feet.

I spent the evening next to the rapidly flowing Baspa River. It was hard to ignore the temptation to cross over the mountains that separate India and Tibet. One day was too short to comprehend the beauty of this village.

Our next day's destination was Kalpa. We had to take a special permit, required for foreigners, from a village called Reckong Peo near Kalpa. After a three-hour scenic drive, we reached Kalpa at noon. However, the sight of the Chini Bazar from Kalpa street with the Kinnar Kailasa mountain in the backdrop will stay forever in my memory.

In the morning, we hit the road again after collecting the permit from the District Magistrate's office. On day four, 162 km to score, the destination was Tabo.

On the way to Tabo, the surrounding scenes began to change. As we were gaining altitude, the greenery slowly faded. When we reached the village called Nako, there were deserts and high mountains all around. After seeing the Nako Monastery, believed to be founded in the 11th century, and Nako Lake, we were on our way to Tabo. We stopped at Gue monastery, which is famous for a 500-year-old mummy of a Buddhist monk, who, according to popular stories, started his mummification process while he was still alive.

We had to spend the night at a homestay there as it was already dark. That was our first night in Spiti.

The next morning, after reaching Tabo, we went out to see Tabo Monastery, touted as the oldest gompa in India. The monastery was founded more than a millennium ago in 996 AD. The monastery complex houses a unique collection of Buddhist paintings and statues that illustrate the history of Tibetan–Indian Buddhism.

Our next destination was Kaza. On the way, we visited Dhankar Monastery. Strategically built at the highest location in Spiti Valley (3,894 metres), it was once the capital of Spiti in the 17th century.

We arrived at Kaza, the largest township and commercial centre of the Spiti valley, in the afternoon.

We stayed here for two days to visit some of the most interesting sites around it -- world's highest post office in the village of Hikkim at 14,400 feet, the highest motorable village, Komic. In Chicham village, we saw the Chicham Bridge, claimed to be the highest suspension bridge in the world.

But the main attraction here was the Key Monastery. The way this temple and its other buildings are built around a mountain is spectacular. The artefacts, history of this monastery and the view from its balcony were simply the feed for another story. When I entered the old part of the monastery, it felt like I had gone back thousands of years!

From Kaza, we went to Losar. The plan was to visit the famous Chandratal Lake the next day, on the way to Manali. In the evening, it started snowing after reaching there. I couldn't be happier to see such a beautiful sight from my homestay room.

The next morning, we left Losar through the Kunzum La Pass, the highest point on the Spiti road trip at 4551 meters.

From Losar, the road to Manali was almost inaccessible. At noon, we arrived at Chandratal Lake, which is also known as Moon Lake. It is a wonder to have such a huge lake at about 14,000 thousand feet above sea level. There is also a myth that fairies come at night to this huge lake!

We spent the night at Sissu. The next morning, we reached Manali, ending a 9-day trip packed with self-discovery and realization.

This road trip can be completed in fewer days. But to enjoy the rustic landscape, cliffhanger roads, treacherous curves, and high passes, I will recommend you to extend the tour as much as you can.

If you love nature and adventure, Spiti has to be your next trip.

Costs: Your expenditures will depend on the duration of the trip and where you stay and eat. Around Rs 50,000 may be required for a 15-day Dhaka-Spiti Valley round trip.

670,Pungyen Gompa where the mountains whisper,"A blunt, frosty night hugged me as I went out of the wooden cottage at Shayla, one of the beautiful tiny hamlets on the slopes of Mansiri Himal.

It was 3:30 am.

The whole village, located on the Manaslu circuit trek, looked haunted. Even the stray dogs weren't barking.

We were one of the first teams to visit this part of the Himalayas in recent times. Covid-19 pandemic has hit the local tourism industry hard. Most of the teahouses were shut due to a lack of trekkers, except for a couple of small huts like the one we took refuge in.

We switched on our headlights and started trekking for Pungyen Gompa, a monastery built just beneath the shoulder of mount Manaslu, locally known as Mt. Pungyen.

Local Nubri people, a Tibetan nomadic tribe said to have settled here 400 years ago, believe high on the icy peaks dwells the deity called lord Pungyen, protector of the region. They built the monastery to please the deity.

I am on a mission.

A couple of years ago I developed this crazy urge to explore the great arc of the Himalayas. From Nanga Parbat in the western Himalayas in Pakistan to Namcha Barwa in the eastern Himalayas in Tibet, I set my goal to trek this whole staggering 2,800-mile terrain spanning Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet.

To complete this mammoth task, going for the Nepal chapter first was a convenient choice for me.

After traversing the Annapurna, Langtang, Dhaulagiri, and Rolwaling regions in recent times, it's time to explore the Manaslu and Ganesh Himal regions.

This phase of the exploration began on April 30 from Maccha Khola after an 8-hour drive from Kathmandu (distance 80 km). We entered Manaslu Circuit Trek on May 08, after exploring Tsum Valley, a relatively unexplored destination, for 7 days. On May 12, we took the side trek to Pungyen Gompa from Shayla. The trekking ended on May 20 when we reached Dharapani, 397 km away from Kathmandu.

Salehin Arshady is an explorer, mountaineer, youth activist and writer. He has climbed and documented all the highest peaks of Bangladesh over 3000 feet and explored many trekking routes in the Indian and Nepal Himalayas. He lives by exploring unknown territories and with his writings unearth stories that inspire humans to consider their relationship with nature.

We walked through the silent village following a tiny path and soon entered the towering realm of age-old pines.

The dark, mysterious forest witnessed seven sparkling head torches moving slowly. After walking a while, the forest patch ended. We came in front of a long suspension bridge over a stream coming from the Pungyen glacier, one of the prominent glaciers of Manaslu, the eighth highest mountain in the world.

I decided to rest for a couple of minutes. My teammates moved on. Their headlights on the bridge looked like some wandering fireflies. I switched off my torch to enjoy this spectacular sight. One by one the fireflies vanished in the next turn. Suddenly, I was swallowed by pitch-black darkness.

After a couple of minutes, as my eyes got adjusted, I looked up at the moonless sky. It was stunning! The Milky Way was hanging over the silhouette of the Himalayan giants like a carpet of numerous luminescent dots on the largest canvas.

It was a moment of revelation! On that mountain trail in the darkness, I thought I had a glimpse into the purpose of life.

I always wondered why the sages, the yogis, and the prophets choose to meditate in the mountains. What could be the connection between spirituality and mountains? The answer might be rooted in the uninterrupted, deafening silence, in the absolute detachment from the hustle and bustle of daily life.

Overwhelmed with lots of half-grasped thoughts, I started walking quietly. After a while, I regrouped with the team.

The path was getting steeper. For half an hour we climbed an uphill track and soon reached beyond the tree line, and the whole landscape started to change dramatically leading us to a ravishing stream, coming directly from the melting Pungyen glacier.

The trail along the stream now became narrower, harder because of boulders and pebbles. As the dawn broke, we started to scramble up this path carefully. Soon the mighty Manaslu and its neighbours chose to reveal themselves. As the first rays of the sun hit the peaks, a riot of colours engulfed the Himalayan giants unveiling a mesmerizing show.

As we climbed further up, we, coincidentally, encountered an ancient wooden door hidden in the mist. It seemed like we were standing at the doorway of heaven guarded by white-cloaked giants. I had the intuition that, beyond that half-closed door, I was about to discover something incredible.

The gut feeling proved to be right. As the mist lifted the curtain, we saw a lush green meadow adorned by beautiful wildflowers. Apart from white and pink rhododendrons, large patches of yellow cowslips and blue drumstick primroses painted the valley in varied hues.

The pristine alpine meadow was surrounded by the snow-covered giants with glaciers hanging from their flanks gleaming in the sun. A stream was flowing gently cutting through the grassland like a silver serpent, making a bubbling sound. There was also a small lake. I sat on its bank quietly and spent time watching the sublime reflection of the towering peaks -- Himal Chuli, Ngadi Chuli, and all its neighbors being kissed by floating clouds. But Manaslu was shy. A veil of clouds obscured the two-horned deity, the mountain of the soul.

The lake was like a giant screen and the whole landscape was an amphitheater. I was hypnotised. I wished to stop the clock at that very moment.

On the horizon, just beneath the glacier, I could see a solitary Kani, a monument of stones engraved with Buddhist holy scripts standing proudly. After six long hours of trekking, we finally reached our destination -- the famous monastery of Pungyen valley. Sitting at an altitude of 4,700 meters, Pungyen Gompa is a hermitage where devoted Buddhist monks isolate themselves from worldly chaos and meditate in the lap of the Himalayas peacefully.

Paradise is only for the deserving ones – for those who could sacrifice all the worldly desires, could breathe the thin air, withstand harsh weather, and be ready for all the arduous efforts to survive with the bare minimum. And there I was, full of worldly needs and desires. These mystical dimensions were much grander than my grasp.

I looked at the clock, it was already noon. Sun was radiating extreme heat. Thick clouds from below started to enter the valley and in a twinkling of an eye, the whole paradise was lost. The time was up and we started to descend. As we returned to the wooden door, I looked back but could see nothing but mist.

However, I could sense a beckoning silence coming from the mystic land, and I knew I had to come back, again and again, to explore what lies behind those snow-covered giants.

671,Wild Saingpra the majestic waterfall,"It felt so peaceful!

It was too early even for the roosters to break the tranquility of Khemchong Para, an indigenous neighbourhood in Ali Kadam, Bandarban.

It was 5:30 in the morning. The silence was magical.

The cool breeze that was circulating in the room through the window slit made it harder for me to leave the warmth of the quilt. It rained a lot during the night.

But the next thought pushed me out of bed. I was going to meet the wild Saingpra, a majestic waterfall, that day.

As I opened the window of the cozy cottage, floating clouds greeted me with their misty, earthy embrace. The soft glow before the sunrise turned the rain-soaked lavish green mountains into a wonderland.

I had little time to get ready. Visiting Saingpra wasn't going to be easy. Day-long arduous trekking was awaiting us all.

It was the third day of our tour which started on August 16, 2021. We, 11 of us from different parts of the country, set out on our mission to cover the highest summits and waterfalls in the Ali Kadam area. Nine of my travel mates were total strangers to me. But when everyone shares the same goal, bonding happens automatically.

The first two days were hectic. We summited Kris Taung (approx. 2949 feet) and Rungrang Taung (approx. 2772 feet), the two highest peaks in the Chimbuk range. After six to seven hours of trekking each day, my legs were tired. But I was determined to meet Saingpra, the highest waterfall in the Ali Kadam, come what may.

It was drizzling again.

We waited for it to stop, but there was no sign. So, after a warm, hearty breakfast of noodles and coffee, we started trekking.

From the beginning, the trail was slippery. After trekking for 30-40 minutes on the hilly trail, we reached a beautiful green flat land surrounded by hills. The view was refreshing for our tired minds and soul.

The trail got tougher at this point. Landslides, caused by downpour, made the already muddy and slippery downhill trek riskier. Our progress slowed down considerably as we had to be extra cautious. One wrong step could have cost us dearly.

After a short walk down this muddy patch, we came to a dense bamboo bush. The path here was also slippery, but trekking was a little easier. After ascending for a while, we went down a jhiri poth (trail along a small stream). We took a short break here.

From there, the trail was different from others we trekked before. It was full of boulders, and each boulder was about 8-9 feet in height and slippery. And the trail was full of leeches. I felt like crying but there was no going back.

We helped each other to cross these huge boulders. It was just 10:30 am, but the trail was getting darker as sunlight barely pierced through the dense forest.

The trail was ""dangerously beautiful"" that day. The gorgeous landscape was a sight to remember and cherish for life.

After a while, another huge boulder stood in our way -- larger than all those we left behind. We tried to climb it up but that wasn't an easy task. We looked around to find another way and noticed thick roots, which came as a lifesaver. One by one, we crossed this rock, scrambling, crawling.

After walking for another 30 minutes, it was time for a little rest. We ate dry food, before walking for another 10 minutes to reach the bottom of the Saingpra waterfall. It was around 11:30 AM.

I was not ready for what I saw. A gigantic stream was falling from 290 feet above. I sat in front of that waterfall in amazement, oblivious for a while to the world. Then, seeing other team members showering, I couldn't resist myself.

But the quest was to climb to the top of the four-step waterfall. We had to climb a steep path to reach the upper steps, literally making our way through. It was so slippery and steep that we stopped short of reaching the top. It was getting too risky.

We spent as long as we could in the arms of this wild beauty. The sky was getting darker, and it was now time to return. We took the same route back. But to our surprise, this time it took us half the time to cross the trail. As soon as we crossed the jhiri trail, it started raining. Water was flowing down the hill, washing away the mud, making our trek easier and faster.

We reached Khemchong Para by afternoon.

The next 3 days, we trekked to seven more waterfalls including Kra Taung upper stream and downstream, Ladmerakh, Jaam Rung, Palong Khiyang upper and downstream and Thang Koyain.

But the trek to the Saingpra waterfall remains the highlight of the tour.

Yes, we did it! It's been a year, but the memories are still alive.

HOW TO GO THERE?

Take a direct bus from Chattogram to Chakariya. Then, there are local buses from Chakariya to Ali Kadam. You can take a jeep (locally known as chander gari) too. After reaching Ali Kadam bazar, you have to take a ride on local CNG to Aamtali ghat. Here you have to hire a boat and after a 2-2:30-hour journey, you will reach Dhusri bazaar. Here the trek starts. Until you reach Dhusri bazaar again, all you have to do is ""WALK"".

WHERE TO STAY?

This trek is relatively in a remote place in Bandarban. You have to rely on the cottages of local people. So plan your tour accordingly. Another surprising issue is no one will cook for you there. We carried food from Chattogram. However, the locals were friendly and I didn't feel unsafe for a moment during the whole tour.

COST

The trip starting from Chattogram can be managed in 5-7 thousand taka.

672,A trip to Maasai Mara-Serengeti,"Some encounters and experiences are humbling and mind-altering. They serve as a reminder of our insignificance on the scale of the vast entities, the universe. Shattering our deluded belief of superiority, these experiences tell us that we humans are merely a minuscule part of Mother Earth.

This story is about our 9-day trip to East Africa, during which we roamed across the greater Serengeti-Mara ecosystem.

On the 30th of May, we arrived at Nairobi, Kenya. After spending the night at a local hotel, we took a flight from Wilson Airport to Maasai Mara Kitchwa Tembo airstrip the next morning. Nelson, our safari guide and driver, picked us up from the airport and took us to Sanctuary Olonana, a well-equipped safari lodge by the Mara River in the heart of the 1,510 square km Maasai Mara National Reserve.

Honks and grunts from hippos were our alarm clock early in the morning! The lodge was just a few feet from the Mara River, home to those enormous animals.

The courageous Maasai people, the region's aboriginal inhabitants, are the origin of the name Maasai Mara. ""Mara"" means spotted in the Maasai language which refers to the many small bushes and trees dotting the broad, green terrain.

Sarmin Shahariath and Rejaul Bahar, married since 2005, are avid travellers. Born and raised in Bangladesh, Bahar moved to the USA in 1999 and now lives in Connecticut. Sarmin joined him in 2005. So far they have travelled 85 countries across seven continents.

GAME DRIVE IN MAASAI MARA

A ""game"" drive around Maasai Mara could be planned for early morning, half a day, or, a full day. We chose to go out for half a day twice and a full day once in our 4-day stay. Wildlife is referred to as ""game."" Open four-wheel-drive cars are used for safari. The maximum security in this scenario is provided by the guides and their extensive knowledge and expertise. We were able to observe a lion pride from about 10 feet away while riding in an open car. Luckily for us, the mighty beings did not pay any heed to us!

Not so long ago, tourists, mostly from the wealthy countries, would come to these safaris to kill the Big Five - lion, leopard, elephant, rhino, and buffalo - for recreation. The killings have largely gone down, but the tourism sector still uses the ""Big Five Game Drive"" phrase.

Nelson was enthusiastic to show us the finest of Maasai Mara and made sure we saw the Big Five, and more.

On June 1, we were out early for a full-day game drive. We were enjoying the unique savanna landscape -- driving through the dirt roads, taking coffee breaks while watching wildlife where they belong.

But, the day had something special in store for us.

The pace of the morning quickened when Nelson received a call from a fellow guide. While rushing towards a spot, he informed us that a cheetah had been spotted nearby. We caught sight of the enigmatic animal once we arrived. After a little time, we lost track of it as it glided across the tall prairie.

So, we moved on to explore other parts of The Mara -- what locals call this place.

After half an hour, Nelson, listening to the radio, again rushed back to the scene where the cheetah was spotted earlier. This time the magnificent wild cat was out, a few feet away from us. Nelson told us from his experience that the beast was out for a hunt.

The cheetah was moving slowly. We and a few other cars were observing it from a distance. In her direction, we noticed a few gazelles were grazing miles away.

It was in no hurry. Closing in on its prey, it stood up on a termite hill, perhaps to take a better look.

Suddenly, the cheetah made its move. In a flash, she lunged at her prey. But within a few seconds, she stopped.

She had miscalculated!

The fastest land animal on Earth didn't mind at all. She turned around and started walking back slowly to where she came from. Nature of life.

It was almost afternoon and we were famished. We asked Nelson to give up on following the cheetah. But Nelson was adamant -- he knew the cheetah would make another move.

However, we couldn't spot her prey! Then Nelson, using a binocular, spotted a few more gazelles, almost a mile away from the cheetah. His experienced eyes even identified the prey the wild cat, according to him, had selected -- a young gazelle.

The word Serengeti means endless plains. One has to come here to see the true meaning of it. Serengeti (north, central, south) is almost 20 times larger than Maasai Mara.

This time, we couldn't follow the cheetah. Laws in Mara Reserve prohibit following an animal while on an active hunt. But if any beast makes the kill, cars can get close.

Nelson was right. Soon, the mighty cat was in top-flight chasing her prey, the young gazelle. It seemed unreal how fast the cheetah was moving.

She was lucky this time. So was I - my camera was rolling.

Soon after the successful kill, Nelson's car raced through the bumpy savanna towards the scene. Just 10-15 feet away, the predator and prey were lying on the ground. The gazelle, still alive, renounced. The cheetah was exhausted, huffing. The scene was intriguing, yet sad. But such is the cycle of life!

She finally had her meal.

KICHAKANI SERENGETI CAMP, TANZANIA

After four amazing days, we moved from Maasai Mara to Northern Serengeti, Tanzania. Serengeti and Mara form one vast open landscape. To get there, though, we required two flights. From the airstrip, our guide there, Emanuel, took us to Kichakani Serengeti Camp.

Out on the open grassland, it was a striking sight. The nights were kind of daunting though. Bellowing elephants and laughing hyenas beside our tent made sleep difficult.

Game drive in Serengeti was completely different. The word ""Serengeti"" means endless plains. Serengeti (north, central, south) is almost 20 times larger than Maasai Mara.

This is the place where the Great Migration starts. About 2 million wildebeests and 200,000 zebras and countless other animals move across the Serengeti South to Central, then North to Maasai Mara during the dry season crossing the most dangerous Mara River for fresh grass. Many animals fall prey to crocodiles in this process.

The migration arrives in the Maasai Mara around the beginning of July and around October. We were a little early for the spectacle. When we visited, the herds were still in the Central Serengeti moving north.

In Serengeti, we witnessed lions mating, enjoyed lunch in the open savanna, and cruised through head-high grasslands filled with wildlife.

NGORONGORO CRATER CAMP, TANZANIA

Ngorongoro (pronounced ""Goron-goro"") was the last leg of our trip. From Kichakani Serengeti Camp, we relocated to this beautiful acreage.. An aircraft took us from Lamai to Manyara airstrip.

After arriving, we spent our afternoon in the Lake Manyara National park.

At the very end of the day, we drove to the crater, Ngorongoro. We checked in to Sanctuary Ngorongoro Crater Camp located up on the crater rim.

The 260 sq km volcanic crater with a unique ecosystem is about 2 million years old and home to many species. Nowhere in Africa will you witness such species saturation!

How to go there?

One of the reputable luxury safari providers, Sanctuary Retreats, organized our trip. It was designed just for the two of us. They managed our accommodation, food, and commutation between countries and parks.

Expenditures: The all-inclusive 9-day package cost us $16 thousand except for tips.",2022-06-01 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/Star-Holiday/news/trip-maasai-mara-serengeti-3061696,2023-05-18 10:32:42,thedailystar
673,The Unique Sundarbans,"She never gets old.

The Sundarbans, with all her magical ambience and rich biodiversity, never fails to nourish your weary senses and soul. She never disappoints you. Every time you visit there, she keeps more surprises for you at every corner you go.

This was the sixth time in as many years when we, a group of wildlife photographers and nature enthusiasts, visited the forest, a Unesco Natural Heritage site, last November. Well, we had to. We couldn't resist her charm. The beauty of nature there – the unique landscape of the world's largest mangrove forest, the incredible wildlife, the silent canals, lifestyle of locals -- drew us towards her.

Ruddy Kingfisher

She is simply irresistible.

We started our tour from Mongla, Khulna, on November 10, last year. As planned, we boarded the tour operator's boat from there after a hectic 11-hour bus journey from Dhaka. Our first destination was Kokilmoni in the Sarankhola range of the forest. Our nerves took some time to settle down. Our brains had to struggle to realize that the next few days would be different from the urban, mechanical life that we live.

On the first day, we went to bed early to catch the sunrise to feel the forest, which literally wakes up with the Sun. You have to engage all your senses to feel the beauty, serenity and vibe of the forest.

Mudskippers

As the first beam of the Sun pierced the fearsome darkness, illuminating the foggy landscape, we saw the transformation of the forest. The dark vines turned into glittering canals, the frightening silence became a chorus of life.

It was breathtaking. But that wasn't the highlight of that morning!

While cruising along the Pasur River, at around 7:15 am, something caught our attention from a distance. A large animal was crossing the river. As we drew nearer, it became apparent what the animal was.

A royal Bengal tiger!

The king of the Sundarbans looked clearly tired and we decided not to go close to it for its safety. Our guide and boat captain both agreed that it was highly unusual even for a full-grown tiger to cross a 600-700 meters wide river. We took as many photos as we could without disturbing the royal beast.

Now, few months after the encounter, I can't but think myself extremely lucky. One of our groupmates, Touhid Parvez Biplob, visited the Sundarbans for 26 times, without any luck!

According to the last census in 2019, only 114 Bengal tigers are in the 6017 square kilometers area of the Sundarbans in Bangladesh part.

For the next 3 days, luck stayed with us as we visited a number of spots and saw a plenty of wildlife at their natural habitat. We spotted all 7 species of kingfishers living in the forest, among which 5 species- Ruddy Kingfisher, Brown-winged Kingfisher, Black-capped Kingfisher, White-collared Kingfisher and Blue-eared Kingfisher - are rare.

Asker Ibne Firoz is a Nature and Lifestyle photographer. He has been awarded with a number of National and International awards.

Scarlet Minivet

Colours of the sunbirds and minivets would simply blow your mind away.

The wader birds (Whimbrel, Eurasian Curlew, different Sandpipers, Common Green Shank, Red Shank etc), Lesser Adjutant, White-bellied Sea Eagle and many others would always catch your attention by their endless activities.

We saw Spotted Deer everywhere. The sight of otters hunting fish or spotting an Irrawaddy dolphin near your boat might make your day. You would be amazed if you closely observe the activities of a mudskipper, a small aquatic creature. The different colours of crabs were simply astonishing.

But the surprises kept coming! We spotted even a rarer species than the Bengal tiger before we concluded our tour on November 14.

Masked Finfoot!

According to a 2020 study, there exist only 100-300 of this critically endangered aquatic bird in the entire world. The Sundarbans is still a breeding ground for them.

However, deforestation and global warming are damaging the Sundarbans. To protect this unique ecosystem as well as the natural shield that saves us from cyclones and tidal waves, we need to act fast.

About visiting Sundarbans

Though the Sundarbans can be accessed through various points, the popular starting points are Khulna and Mongla. Many tour operators run different package tours which starts from 6000 taka to 25000 taka per person for a standard 2 Nights 3 days all-inclusive tour. Most tours usually take you to Kochikhali Wildlife Sanctuary, Kotka beach, Jamtola Beach, Herbaria Mangrove Trail, Hiron Point, Dublar Char, Trikona Island, Dimer Char, Koromjol wildlife centre and few other places. We loved the food our tour operator provided us during the tour.

675,"Antarctica: The magical, white continent","Was it real?

Those mysterious blinding-white landscapes, the ethereal silence, the pristine nature relatively untouched by us – humans!

At the end of the world, there exists this entire continent in isolation – inhospitable for humans – covered with thick ice. Here the penguins, whales and the albatrosses rule, far from the maddening crowd.

This is Antarctica, the last continent. My wife Sharmin and I have just returned from this magical place.

In 2008, when we made our first international trip to the Bahamas little did we know about the drug that we were injecting into our blood – a drug that will awaken in us the desire to see the world. Since then, we have travelled to every corner of the world, all seven continents, 83 countries as of January 2022.

But visiting Antarctica wasn't in our typical travel bucket list. Biggest hurdle was, of course, financing the trip. Though both of us were working and earning, we had to wait for years to save the money for the trip.

In August 2019, after lots of planning, we pulled the trigger and wrote the biggest bank cheque of our travel history -- $32,000 paid in full for the trip scheduled in November 2020, 15 months ahead of the time.

But then came the Covid pandemic. The tour operator, Silversea, offered an upgraded voyage scheduled in 2021. For the 15-night all-inclusive cruise package starting from December 21 to January 5, 2022. Silversea's price tag was now about $48,000. Luckily, we didn't have to pay the extra amount as we paid two and a half years ago.

Finally, our journey started on December 19, 2021, when we boarded the plane from our home state Connecticut, USA, to Santiago, Chile. From there Silversea chartered flight took us to Punta Arenas, from where we boarded our Silversea Cloud Expedition ship on December 21, 2021.

We couldn't believe we were actually going to Antarctica until the ship left the port. So many years in planning, so many hurdles we crossed!

To get to the mysterious continent, first we had to face Drake Passage, one of the roughest sea routes not to be crossed for fun, for two days. Though the ice-class Silversea sails here year after year with experienced professionals onboard, looking at the violent sea, far away from the civilisation, one can't simply resist the thought of how intimidating Mother Nature can be. Three nights onboard, including one sleepless night while crossing the Passage, we have seen nothing but blue ocean. Then one early morning I woke up, opened the curtain between our sleeping suite and balcony and couldn't believe my eyes.

We have arrived!

Right in front of my eyes, white mysterious landscapes covered with fog were moving slowly as the ship cruised through the calm water.

We sailed around the Antarctic Peninsula for eight days. We visited the South Shetland Islands, Elephant Island, and wildlife-rich Falkland Islands and crossed Antarctic Sound twice. We made several onshore excursions, multiple zodiac cruising, kayaking through ice and unique wildlife. We took countless photos but none could capture a fraction of what's out there.

The dazzling white landscapes, city-sized icebergs passing by were something hard to grasp looking at it. Did you know some of the largest icebergs have their own names? Largest iceberg currently floating in the Antarctic Peninsula is more than five times bigger than Singapore.

And I took a polar plunge! It wasn't easy to decide. Then I thought about my Ma (mother). The woman I lost a few months ago, my last hiding place, and my last shelter; the woman who struggled so hard through her entire life to give her children a better life.

I decided that I would do it for her. Then I just jumped. I knew she smiled at my madness.

Yes! We went to Antarctica. Yes! We landed on the solitary, white continent. We have seen mountains of ice, glaciers, icebergs and unique wildlife. But the fact is we only touched the very tip of Antarctica.

The mighty continent is beyond our reach and exploration. Only few with resources and dedication can see the inland part of it.

Antarctica was a life-changing experience. Our expedition would remain as if it were a dream. I know I was there, but can't explain where I was.

But this isn't the end. We want to keep making our own stories. We want to explore the world before our eyes close forever.

Scooping out 20-22 days from our busy life requires some planning. The tour usually starts from Argentina and Chile. The average Antarctica cruise cost is about $8000 per person. The least expensive expeditions starts at $5000, but these deals are usually booked months/years ahead of the voyage. Luxury voyages may cost a person anything between $15000-$50000. The cost varies depending on the services, added optional adventure activities and gears.

678,We must curb rising inequality,"Reforms following the IMF prescription should not harm disadvantaged groups

At a recent dialogue organised by the Citizen's Platform for SDGs, speakers rightly emphasised the need for the government to balance economic reforms – some of which are preconditions for accessing the IMF's $4.7 billion loan – in a way that can rein in economic disparity in Bangladesh. As the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2022 has demonstrated, inequality is indeed rising in the country. According to data, the Gini coefficient related to income rose to 0.499 in 2022, up from 0.482 in 2016 and 0.458 in 2010. A combination of this with the ongoing global and domestic economic challenges, and the obligation to meet IMF conditions through various spending cuts, could lead to faster inequality growth.

By now, numerous studies have shown us that inequality tends to rise during IMF programmes or as a result of IMF conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to adjust its conditions in a way that can contain inequality. Experts, for example, have urged the government to allow specialised and subsidised credit schemes for those involved in agriculture and cottage, micro, small and medium enterprises (CMSME), and for women and youth, while maintaining flexible interest rates as per the IMF recommendations. Additionally, while the government needs to reduce tax exemptions to meet loan conditions, it should do so in a way that does not hurt small and medium enterprises.

How the government plans and implements the upcoming national budget will also be a big factor, as far as inequality is concerned. Allocation for disadvantaged groups should not suffer as a consequence of the government's fiscal constraints. If anything, the government should ensure that much of its limited resources is directed towards the needs of these groups. It also needs to ensure greater accountability and transparency in its budgetary allocations and delivery, so that corruption – which always hits disadvantaged groups the hardest, while benefitting special interest groups – is reduced.

As the planning minister himself has admitted, there are many tax evaders and defaulters in the country. Taking action against them, however difficult that may seem, is a must for any reform to be sustainable.",2023-05-17 01:03:04,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/we-must-curb-rising-inequality-3321656,2023-05-18 10:32:49,thedailystar
679,A poll-time government without BNP?,"A fair election will require much more than token initiatives

We appreciate what appears to be the first sign of flexibility in the administration about forming a poll-time government ahead of the national election. The prime minister on Monday hinted that a poll-time government with parties having representation in parliament could be formed. By the same logic, however, she rejected the possibility of the BNP, whose MPs had resigned from parliament last December, being a part of it. She also ruled out any dialogue with BNP as it leads a nationwide anti-government movement.

There are a number of takeaways from the PM's statement. First of all, the apparent willingness to bring opposition elements in the government marks a departure from the bellicose posturing that we have come to expect from ruling-party politicians. But that hardly rises to the level expected in the present environment of distrust, with BNP edged out of the process on a technicality. Also, the PM's tone, alluding to ""our generosity"" for forming such a government, leaves doubt about how impactful it might be. One thing that we don't want to see is token representation without real power.

Secondly, BNP remains the biggest opposition party regardless of its representation or lack thereof in parliament. So, how judicious is it to exclude it from a potential poll-time government or any dialogue on said government and the election in general? Dialogue at the top level may not be on the cards right now, but mid-ranked leaders from both parties can, and should, start the process. Dialogue is essential for any solution to the current political impasse.

Thirdly, formation of a poll-time government is but a means to an end, which is to ensure that those in charge have the trust of all political elements and the general public so that they can deliver a fair and credible election. So how should that government be formed? The PM offers a way, but it cannot be the only way. Any poll-time government without the representation of main political elements will not solve the pressing issues we face. Also, how will it perform? Will it be unidimensional where everything is decided from the top, as it is now? These things must be considered going forward.

As the chief election commissioner repeated on Monday, the commission alone cannot hold a fair election without the help of the government. Without taking away from the responsibility of the EC, we think that some sort of a credible power structure in the driving seat is a crucial precondition for any fair election.",2023-05-16 12:24:22,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/poll-time-government-without-bnp-3321686,2023-05-18 10:32:51,thedailystar
680,We must restore trust in e-commerce,"Authorities should ensure full repayment to defrauded customers

It is difficult to buy into the promise of a Smart Bangladesh when justice continues to elude many victims of e-commerce scams. Over the past few years, thousands of customers have lost money to such scams. As per a new report, as many as 19,623 complaints against 50 e-commerce companies – filed with the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection – remain unresolved, with Tk 600 crore yet to paid to complainants. This points to a desperate need for safeguarding the interests of customers and strengthening the legal framework related to e-commerce platforms.

Many of the companies that have been accused of scams are practically defunct now. In the absence of adequate mechanisms to hold them accountable, the commerce ministry is paying victims from the Tk 525 crore (of 27 e-commerce companies) stuck in payment gateways. One would think that the priority would be recovering money from the companies themselves. But owners of fraudulent companies seem to be out of reach, some being unresponsive presently (such as the bosses at Evaly) and others having fled the country.

How did we get to this point? Why haven't systems been put into place to protect e-commerce consumers? They certainly do not deserve the uncertainty that has been created. Against this backdrop, one hopes that the Central Complaint Management System (CCMS) launched by the ministry on February 19 will be helpful in addressing some of the concerns.

As e-commerce thrives around the globe, we sincerely hope that Bangladesh will be able to keep up by establishing a foolproof digital infrastructure and ensuring best service for customers. The scams carried out in recent years must not result in citizens losing faith in the sector altogether. We urge the relevant authorities to prioritise the formulation and implementation of proper laws and regulations that protect consumers' best interests. More importantly, those companies accused of scams must face justice for public trust to be fully restored. They must be made to clear the dues owed to complainants, so that no other companies dare to commit fraud in the future.",2023-05-16 04:42:29,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/we-must-restore-trust-e-commerce-3321396,2023-05-18 10:32:52,thedailystar
681,Time to rebuild life in St Martin's Island,"Relief and rehabilitation are priority in Mocha-hit areas after the worst was averted

We are relieved that the extremely severe cyclonic storm Mocha did not cause as much damage in Bangladesh as initially feared. The hardest hit regions in the country were Cox's Bazar and Saint Martin's Island, where around 13,500 houses were affected. Among them, around 1,200 houses were destroyed on St Martin's Island, and more than 2,800 shanties were affected in the Rohingya refugee camps of Cox's Bazar.

Apart from a change in the direction of the storm – away from Bangladesh and toward Myanmar – a low tide at the time of landfall further helped in minimising damage in Bangladesh. Early evacuation of more than a million people also played a big part. Nevertheless, thousands of people have been left homeless, leaving them open to huge suffering. This makes it vital that urgent assistance is provided by the government, which should coordinate with humanitarian organisations to ensure that aid reaches victims on time and in an organised manner.

Aside from financial assistance, the government and others should provide medical and food assistance as well. It is important to remember that the chance of diseases breaking out post-disaster is always high. Therefore, there should be no delay in providing medical assistance in the affected coastal areas. Removing the remnants of uprooted trees and damaged houses is also a challenging task. Rebuilding efforts are particularly needed on Saint Martin's Island, which took a massive battering even though there was no reported loss of life.

Although it is early to estimate the full extent of the damage caused by Mocha, there is no doubt that it has caused significant harm to local industries and businesses. Movement of goods at the Chattogram Port has had to be halted since Friday, which is going to be costly for the economy, particularly for many of our exporters. So, the government should take special measures to ensure that operational activities at our main seaport resume without further hindrance.

Ultimately, the nation was spared from much greater damage due to good fortunate. At the same time, our strong disaster preparedness also played a part in that. Since we cannot bet on luck to save us from future disasters, after helping people to recover from the fallouts of Cyclone Mocha, the government should continue to focus on its disaster preparedness, including by fortifying compromised embankments.",2023-05-15 12:02:30,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/time-rebuild-life-st-martins-island-3320796,2023-05-18 10:32:53,thedailystar
682,"Parks and recreation, a distant dream","Do authorities care at all about citizens' quality of life?

In a city starved of green and open spaces, it is inconceivable that two major parks, Osmani Udyan and Panthakuja, have been made inaccessible to the public in the name of development work. Five years have passed since the so-called beautification projects – which was supposed to be completed within a year – were first undertaken, with no visible progress or end in sight of the construction work. In the meantime, as reported by this daily, these parks, which used to attract a large number of people from all walks of life, have become hotbeds of illegal encroachment and criminal activities.

As is usually the case with development projects in the country, a huge amount of taxpayers' money has been allocated for these projects, but there appears to be no accountability of the authorities to ensure corresponding public benefit. As per the Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC), the project deadline for Osmani Udyan was extended three times and the cost increased from Tk 54 crore to Tk 89 crore before the DSCC finally cancelled the contract with the assigned construction firm eight months ago. A new contracting firm is yet to be appointed, and it is anybody's guess when the new contractor will be able to finish the deliverables. Meanwhile, the DSCC's Tk 19.20 crore beautification project for Panthakunjo Park has been suspended due to a dispute between the DSCC and relevant government organisations over the installation of Elevated Expressway pillars within the park. The lacklustre attitude of the DSCC over the protracted delay in finishing the projects is simply unacceptable, particularly given that it still doesn't seem to have a deadline in sight for when these open spaces will be open to the public again.

These are hardly the only examples of abandoned or encroached public spaces in Dhaka city. Despite promises over the past six months that the Lalmatia D Block playground will be opened soon, it is still out of commission. The same goes for Trikona park in Lalmatia and Shahid Park in Mohammandpur. And the list, depressingly, goes on. We wonder if the city authorities care at all about the quality of life of residents and realise how crucial open public spaces are in a city that has all but been taken over by concrete. We urge them to stop undertaking massive beautification projects that end up costing, rather than benefitting, the public. The DSCC and DNCC need to take urgent steps to free up and operationalise encroached and abandoned parks.",2023-05-15 05:45:42,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/parks-and-recreation-distant-dream-3320536,2023-05-18 10:32:55,thedailystar
683,Overflow of non-performing loans,"Time for govt to change its policy towards habitual defaulters

Not unsurprisingly, Bangladesh's banking sector now has the second-highest ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) in all of South Asia, as lenders continue to face numerous challenges emanating from scams, a lack of corporate governance, and reluctance by borrowers to make regular instalment payments. It is not an achievement to be proud of by any means. The only country that has a higher ratio of NPLs in South Asia is Sri Lanka, which has been enmeshed in a severe economic crisis.

A World Bank report titled ""Expanding Opportunities: Toward Inclusive Growth"", which exposed this disturbing fact, also revealed that Bangladesh has the highest ratio of NPLs among non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) in the whole of South Asia. In most South Asian countries, NPL ratios remained below the 2021 levels and the 10 percent threshold commonly used to indicate systemic stress in countries of the region. The only exceptions were Bangladesh, where the NPL ratio reached above the 2021 level and reached dangerously close to the 10 percent threshold – logging in at 9.4 percent – and Sri Lanka.

As of December 2022, defaulted loans at banks in Bangladesh had increased 16.8 percent year-on-year to Tk 1,20,656 crore. According to central bank data, the ratio accounted for 8.16 percent of the outstanding loans given out by banks as of December, up from 7.93 percent a year ago. The increase came despite the Bangladesh Bank further relaxing the rules on rescheduling to bring down the rate of default loans last July. What this clearly shows – for the umpteenth time – is that relaxing rules can't tame defaulted loans, as experts have said repeatedly.

In February, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified the problems in the banking sector, including the high volume of NPLs, as one of the three major domestic risks that may derail the economy in the short- to medium-term, and said that the likelihood of it spilling over to the wider economy ranges from medium to high. This is also something economists have been saying for a long time.

The one saving grace for the banking sector and the larger economy could be the adoption of the draft Bank Company (Amendment) Act, 2023, which could potentially usher in major consequences for habitual loan defaulters and restrict the influence of families on a bank's board. However, what is strange in that regard is that the government is yet to publish the draft of the Act, which it was expected to do after the cabinet approved it on March 28. Since it is not a secret document, the government should publish it to receive feedback and recommendations from stakeholders. It should also begin to enforce strict banking rules for habitual defaulters, and ensure that no more scams occur right under the noses of our regulators.",2023-05-14 12:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/overflow-non-performing-loans-3319816,2023-05-18 10:32:56,thedailystar
684,Biman’s unending ‘bimar’,"Sending 100 officials to KSA to ‘help hajj pilgrims’ makes little sense

Biman just can't seem to stay out of negative headlines. After having raised eyebrows last week with reports of an unreasonable decision to purchase 10 Airbus planes and a mid-flight glitch in a plane that had carried the PM to Tokyo, the flag carrier is now reported to be sending about 100 officials to Saudi Arabia in the name of ""assisting"" Bangladeshi hajj pilgrims. According to sources, about Tk 8-10 crore will be spent for their 37-day stay in the kingdom. The lavish spending on something that Biman already has people on the ground to do for it has raised questions about the decision.

Reportedly, officials selected for the trip come from various departments. There are at least 33 from customer service, eight from the engineering and material management department, 28 from sales and marketing, two from administration, and so on. There are allegations that service rules have been violated while making the selections. The bigger question, of course, is whether such a large team is at all necessary. Biman's managing director tried to justify it by saying that there are a lot of services to be provided to pilgrims. But the airline already has a General Sales Agent (GSA) as well as country and station offices in Jeddah, Medina and Makkah that can provide those services. For example, the GSA is obligated to do all kinds of ticket-related work. Why are 28 sales and marketing officials going then? Even with the involvement of additional men, Biman has never been known for ensuring customer satisfaction pre- and post-hajj.

Why does it continue to send such teams then? Apparently, its staff see this as an excursion and a money-making opportunity. A Biman official will get a daily allowance of $220-$225 (around Tk 24,000) during this trip, in addition to other facilities. As a former director told Prothom Alo, ""it is like an annual outing for them."" It adds nothing substantive to the service provided by Biman. In reality, this is nothing but a wastage of public money. At a time when the government is struggling with a sheer dollar shortage and a protracted economic crisis, such trips by state officials are completely unacceptable.

We urge Biman to refrain from normalising this illogical move. Biman is already suffering from an unending ""bimar"" (affliction), with mismanagement and irregularities thwarting its progress. Let's not add to that now.",2023-05-14 06:49:41,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/bimans-unending-bimar-3319556,2023-05-18 10:32:57,thedailystar
685,Brace for the worst,"Govt must take all measures to minimise the damage of Cyclone Mocha

Cyclone Mocha, the first cyclone of the season and likely the biggest in 16 years, will hit our coastline by Sunday afternoon. The ""very severe"" cyclonic storm is approaching Bangladesh with a maximum windspeed of 200 kmph. There are concerns that this may result in widespread devastation in Bangladesh's south-west, among other coastal areas, so we must prepare accordingly.

The current trajectory indicates that Cox's Bazar, Chattogram, Feni and Noakhali are among the most vulnerable districts. Meteorologists say the cyclone may make landfall in Teknaf, which is home to refugee camps for the Rohingya who could be heavily exposed to the elements. Officials have also predicted floods in vast areas along the coastline. The priority right now is to fast-track the evacuation process and ensure that no one is left behind, especially older people, children and persons with disabilities. There is also a risk of landslides in the hilly areas, so people there should too be taken to safety.

It is concerning that nearly 50kms of embankment in Chattogram are reportedly compromised. This means that local communities risk being inundated should storm surges triggered by the cyclone breach those. The question is, why were the embankments not fortified? Why do the authorities wait for a cyclone to hit before rushing to make repairs? As for off-shore islands, it is a relief that tourists have been evacuated from St Martin's Island, but what about the 10,000 or so local residents? Shelters have been readied, we are told, but if the island gets cut off from mainland, will locals have access to sufficient food and other vital essentials?

These concerns must be addressed. So far, the government seems convinced that all necessary preparations have been taken. We must brace for the worst, however. Usually, despite warnings, many people do not leave until the last moment and often refuse to leave behind their prized possessions, especially livestock. This is where local authorities must be firm while conducting evacuations. Casualties, both during and in the aftermath of the cyclone, must be avoided at all costs.",2023-05-13 14:16:07,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/brace-the-worst-3318941,2023-05-18 10:32:59,thedailystar
686,Role of MPs in tackling climate change,"The most positive outcome of COP27 was the agreement to set up a funding mechanism to address loss and damage from human-induced climate change. PHOTO: PRABIR DAS

I had an opportunity to address a meeting of Bangladeshi parliamentarians, under the leadership of Speaker of the House Dr Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, organised by the UNDP, on the outcome of COP27 and the role of parliamentarians going forward.

Let me share some of my remarks to the parliamentarians and also some of the outcomes of the event.

The main positive outcome of COP27, held in November 2022 in Egypt, was the agreement to set up a funding mechanism to address loss and damage from human-induced climate change. This was a major breakthrough agreement and the result of some very effective advocacy and diplomacy by Bangladesh as part of the climate-vulnerable developing countries' group.

The activities of the Transitional Committee on funding loss and damage need to be geared up to get a result in COP28, which is scheduled to be held in December 2023 in Dubai. We must keep a close eye on the work of the Transitional Committee before COP28.

Regarding the role of parliamentarians, there are three levels of action they could get involved in – namely the global, national, and local levels.

Bangladeshi parliamentarians have already been playing a leading role for a number of years. MP Saber Hossain Chowdhury, who have chaired the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) for many years, and Dr Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, who have chaired the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA), both raised the issue of tackling climate change from their respective positions. More recently, under the presidency of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) also set up a new parliamentarian forum, in which all our parliamentarians should join and participate in their deliberations and global advocacy, together with their counterparts from other vulnerable developing countries.

At the national level, the parliamentarians – as part of their membership of the different parliamentary standing committees – have a constitutionally mandated role of overseeing the activities of different ministries of the government and need to sharpen their role in monitoring their activities in tackling climate change, especially the allocation and disbursement of the climate budget under the Ministry of Finance. The climate budget has been an excellent initiative of the finance ministry. But merely announcing the budget allocations without providing information on the actual expenditures will not ensure their usefulness. Hence, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance must take a greater responsibility to oversee the climate budget allocation, as well as expenditures, as they are constitutionally mandated to do.

The third level of activities of parliamentarians was vividly illustrated in real time as we met just as Cyclone Mocha was approaching Bangladesh (before moving on to Myanmar). The cyclone preparedness programme of Bangladesh – which involves everyone from scientists, who track the cyclones, to government agencies responsible for preparation to volunteers letting everyone know about the coming event and helping them get to the shelters – was particularly pertinent as every parliamentarian in the meeting had considerable experience to share on tackling cyclones and other weather-related disasters.

All parliamentarians in Bangladesh, and indeed globally, need to become aware of climate change and about their specific roles in helping their constituents tackle its impacts through effective local adaptation. However, the MPs rightly pointed out that every constituency is different with respect to which climate change impacts need more attention and what they need to do to prepare themselves. Hence, a constituency-by-constituency set of data and information could be developed by the government and experts.

At the same time, a set of parliamentarians from the most vulnerable constituencies could form a special group to get more deeply involved regarding the climate actions needed at the local level in their constituencies.

Finally, I recommended that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment and Climate Change take the lead in learning more about and then implementing the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan (MCPP), along with the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and the Bangladesh Delta Plan. I am pleased that the speaker endorsed this recommendation and asked the UNDP to follow up on it.

It is now clear that every group of citizens in Bangladesh must learn about their respective roles in tackling climate change and then carry out their tasks urgently and at scale. I was pleased to see that our parliamentarians seem to have gotten the message and have taken up their role in earnest, and I am happy to help them in any way I can from hereon.

687,Money makes the world go round – and development succeed,"The key to economic development and ending poverty is investment.

The key to economic development and ending poverty is investment. Nations achieve prosperity by investing in four priority areas. The most important is investing in people, through quality education and healthcare. The next is infrastructure, such as electricity, safe water, digital networks, and public transport. The third is natural capital, protecting nature. The fourth is business investment. The key is finance: mobilising the funds to invest at the scale and speed required.

In principle, the world should operate as an interconnected system. The rich countries, with high levels of education, healthcare, infrastructure, and business capital, should supply ample finance to the poor countries. As the emerging market countries became richer, profits and interest would flow back to the rich countries as returns on their investments.

That's a win-win proposition. Both rich and poor countries benefit. Poor countries become richer; rich countries earn higher returns than they would if they invested only in their own economies.

Strangely, international finance doesn't work that way. Rich countries invest mainly in rich economies. Poor countries get only a trickle of funds, not enough to lift out of poverty.

The problem is that investing in poorer countries seems too risky. This is true if we look at the short run. Suppose that the government of a low-income country wants to borrow to fund public education. The economic returns to education are very high, but take 20-30 years to reap. Yet, loans are often for only five years.

Suppose the country borrows $2 billion today, due in five years. That's okay if, in five years, the government can refinance the $2 billion with yet another five-year loan. With five refinance loans, each for five years, debt repayments are delayed for 30 years, by which time the economy will have grown sufficiently to repay the debt without another loan.

Yet, at some point along the way, the country will find it difficult to refinance the debt. Perhaps a pandemic, or Wall Street banking crisis, or election uncertainty will scare investors. When the country tries to refinance the $2 billion, it finds itself shut out from the financial market. Without enough dollars at hand, and no new loan, the country defaults, and lands in the IMF emergency room, followed by cuts in public spending, social unrest, and prolonged negotiations with foreign creditors.

Knowing this in advance, credit-rating agencies like Moody's and S&P Global give the countries a low credit score, below ""investment grade."" As a result, poorer countries are unable to borrow long-term and pay punishingly high interest rates. While the US government pays less than four percent per year on 30-year borrowing, poor countries often pay 10 percent on five-year borrowing.

The IMF, for its part, advises the governments of poorer countries not to borrow very much. In effect, the IMF tells the government that it is better to forgo education (or electricity, or safe water, or paved roads) to avoid a future debt crisis. That's tragic advice! It results in a poverty trap, rather than an escape from poverty.

The situation has become intolerable. The poorer half of the world is being told by the richer half: decarbonise the energy system; guarantee universal healthcare, education, and access to digital services; protect rainforests; ensure safe water and sanitation; and more. And yet, they are told to do all this with a trickle of five-year loans at 10 percent interest!

The problem isn't with the goals. These are within reach, but only if the investment flows are high enough. Poorer nations need 30-year loans at four percent, not five-year loans at more than 10 percent, and they need much more financing.

There are two main solutions. The first is to expand roughly fivefold the financing by the World Bank and regional development banks (such as the African Development Bank). Those banks can borrow at 30 years and around four percent, and on-lend to poorer countries on highly favourable terms. Yet, their operations are far too small. To scale up, the G20 countries (including the US, China, and EU) need to put more capital into the multilateral banks.

The second is to reorient the global financing system towards long-term sustainable development, with better advice, planning, and accurate ratings. The major countries will have four meetings on global finance this year: in Paris in June, Delhi in September, the United Nations in September, and Dubai in November. If the big countries work together, they can solve this. That's their real job, rather than fighting endless wars.

688,Why the US dollar is an optimal reserve currency for Bangladesh,"Bangladesh received an infamous and inappropriate coverage in the global press that the country was planning to use Indian rupee or Chinese renminbi for international payment settlements. In other words, the argument was that the Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank, would be diversifying its foreign exchange reserves away from the US dollar to include more renminbi and rupee instead. It is infamous and inappropriate because the country's forex reserves continue to consist mostly of the US dollar-denominated assets.

Bangladesh has experienced persistent and increasing bilateral trade imbalances against both China and India over the past decade, particularly since July 1, 2021. Note that most of the country's bilateral trades with China and India are invoiced in US dollars, and so the resultant international payment obligations are settled in US dollars. The idea of settling accrued payment obligations using either the Indian rupee or the renminbi instead of the US dollar is without substance, because their payment settlement is predetermined. In addition, the prevailing forex market really doesn't have access to those alternative currencies at any reasonable costs.

Now, considering that exports from China or India to Bangladesh are invoiced by their national currencies instead of the dollar, one would expect that Bangladeshi importers would be required to settle their international payment obligations in the same currencies. Given that Bangladesh incurred bilateral trade deficits of $23.5 billion against China and $15 billion against India in FY2021-22, the Bangladesh Bank would be obliged to act as the marketmaker for a forex market in the renminbi or rupee. But such a forex market will be dysfunctional, because supply and demand for either of the two currencies are wildly unequal. So the forex market will never clear unless the central bank intervenes as a marketmaker and fills in the gap between demand and supply.

This market-making operation of the central bank will be uneconomical for two reasons. One, the Bangladesh Bank will have to significantly diversify its forex reserves into rupee-denominated or renminbi-denominated assets. The central bank will therefore be susceptible to significant exchange losses every time either of the currencies depreciates against the dollar. Two, more than 90 percent of the global over-the-counter (OTC) forex transactions are denominated in the US dollars. The daily turnover of this market was $7.5 trillion in April 2022. Neither the Chinese yuan nor the Indian rupee enjoys any significance as of now in global forex markets. So as a part of market-making operations, whenever the Bangladesh Bank will buy either the rupee or the renminbi in exchange for the dollar, it will incur relatively large transaction costs. How large will it be? It can be more than 10 times the transaction cost of trading in the US dollars.

As most of the country's international trade and financial transactions have been denominated in the US dollar, bilateral imbalance in the supply and demand for foreign exchange never caused market failure. Until recent times, the OTC market of foreign exchange always cleared without substantial interventions of the central bank. Over the last two financial years, the private flows of foreign exchange didn't clear the market, and so the central bank had to sell more than $20 billion dollars of its net forex reserves. Disequilibrium in the forex market continued nonetheless. The taka has depreciated by more than 30 percent against the US dollar over the last couple of years. As the US dollar is still trading with significant premium in the kerb market, the home currency has remained under devaluation pressure.

Central banks, financial institutions, corporations and currency speculators invoice their international trade and financial transactions in terms of the US dollar because it has been the norm in the international monetary order after World War II. Accordingly, the Bangladesh Bank has maintained a growing volume of forex reserves mostly in the US dollar since its independence in 1971. So the forex market in Bangladesh is characterised by demand for and supply of US dollars. This OTC market in foreign exchange is highly liquid and very efficient, meaning that bid-ask spread is less than 50 basis points for large-size payment settlements. The forex market is also globally integrated.

The proposition that Bangladesh will move away from the US dollar-based payment settlement to a new international payment settlement, which will involve either the rupee or the renminbi as the invoice currency, is of no economic substance. It will produce a number of unintended consequences. Firstly, It will cause inefficient fragmentation of the prevailing forex market, which is dollar-based and globally integrated. Secondly, the Bangladesh Bank will need to diversify its portfolio of forex reserves giving significantly larger weights to the rupee and renminbi. That will complicate monetary and exchange rate policies of the central bank. Thirdly and most intriguingly, such a diversification of the forex portfolio will not be maximising profits for Bangladeshi exporters and importers, domestic borrowers in foreign currencies, nor for the Bangladesh Bank.

A fragmented forex market in some peripheral currencies will prove unforgiving for managing external debt of both public and private sectors of a developing country. As of June 30, 2022, more than 90 percent of public sector external debt, which is approximately $75 billion, is dollar-denominated. Almost 100 percent of private sector external debt, which is approximately $25 billion, is also dollar-denominated. While the external indebtedness of the public sector is long-term and of low cost, that of the private sector is mostly short-term, variable-rated and unhedged. Faced with such a condition, any diversification of forex reserves into peripheral currencies will increase sovereign risks and downgrade the global rating of the country. It is hoped that policymakers will not jump to such a self-sabotaging strategy of exchange rate and forex reserve management.

Exporters of China or India will not prefer invoicing their exports even in their national currencies, not to mention the Bangladeshi taka. It is because of the prohibitive exchange rate uncertainty of those currencies and the lack of instantaneous liquidity of financial assets denominated by those currencies. In fact, the market for government securities or AAA-rated corporate bonds, which are denominated by either the Indian rupee or Chinese renminbi, is mostly localised. Their weight in the global financial market is insignificant. A perilous implication is that corporations will incur prohibitive transaction costs (broadly defined) in settlement of their international payment obligations in this proposed scenario.

Consider this example, if the rupee depreciates by 10 percent against the US dollar over a period of six months, which is the typical credit period of an export, the Indian exporter would lose 10 percent value of his exports in terms of the US dollar because of a rupee-invoicing. The counterparties in Bangladesh, that is, the importers, will face a dysfunctional forex market in the rupee. As I explained previously, those markets will be very illiquid and costly. So all parties to trade will incur larger costs and uncertainties. International trade and finance will surely decline in this case. A natural hedge of any company is to invoice their international trade or financial transactions in a few major currencies including the US dollar notably. A political decision to force international trade and payment settlement away from the US dollar to any non-major currencies will be disruptive, risky and costly.

Think of a scenario where a government-owned corporation in Dhaka will have a Chinese renminbi loan due for settlement on June 30, 2023. The OTC market for foreign exchange in renminbi will not work, because there is already a disequilibrium between demand for and supply of it. It shows that the Bangladesh Bank will be forced to convert their US dollar reserves into renminbi and supply the same to the local forex market in renminbi. Ultimately, the Bangladesh Bank is committing itself into a self-defeating strategy that it will micromanage a forex market in an unimportant currency, incurring private costs and unforeseen exchange risks.

Finally, a fragmented forex market in some peripheral currencies will prove unforgiving for managing external debt of both public and private sectors of a developing country. As of June 30, 2022, more than 90 percent of public sector external debt, which is approximately $75 billion, is dollar-denominated. Almost 100 percent of private sector external debt, which is approximately $25 billion, is also dollar-denominated. While the external indebtedness of the public sector is long-term and of low cost, that of the private sector is mostly short-term, variable-rated and unhedged. Faced with such a condition, any diversification of forex reserves into peripheral currencies will increase sovereign risks and downgrade the global rating of the country. It is hoped that policymakers will not jump to such a self-sabotaging strategy of exchange rate and forex reserve management.

689,It's time we talked about menopause,"When I was in my 20s, my mother was going through a physical and mental transition that her family took lightly, unknowingly. In fact, my father was lost as to how to suddenly deal with a depressed wife. She was an emotional bomb about to burst for no reason; those mood swings were the worst besides her lack of sleep and hot flashes.

The family was not supportive of her newfound indifference towards her everyday normal routine, and could not take the cue as a sign of some sort of health crisis. Later, we realised she was going through menopause. She faced a bad spell of hormonal changes, which might not be the case for others as the symptoms vary.

The physiological age for menopause is between 45 and 55 years; many women go through surgical menopause caused by hysterectomy for other health reasons. With menopause comes various bodily irritability, because the production of the female hormone oestrogen and progesterone, at the time, decreases. It is the big drop in oestrogen levels that causes most of the symptoms of menopause.

A woman, from her puberty or menarche to pregnancy and lactation period to perimenopause, menopause, and finally post-menopause stages, lives with and adapts to different levels of hormonal changes throughout her life. These are all part of natural reproductive health. However, these stages have their nuances that need to be sorted.

In my mother's time, a woman's health – and that, too, her menstrual health – was not something to speak about even within her family boundaries. ""Periods are normal and hormonal changes are natural, so deal with it"" – this was our attitude towards her monthly cycles.

Women need not suffer for these and they must learn to seek medical help. It's also the people around them who need to be empathetic to their mental and physical changes and well-being. The initial physical changes will be scary, but a supportive husband/partner can be extremely helpful in learning to deal with bad tempers, mood swings, and other elements of this natural transition. It is only right to address these symptoms of hormonal changes with tender loving care. It is vital to talk about and listen to her; she needs support and to feel loved and taken care of through this phase of life.

Even women did not know how to address these changes in them – until recently, when they can freely talk about taboo health topics. Thus, our mothers aged quickly and were sad most of the time, while we modern women try to learn and make adjustments as our body demands.

I made sure my husband is aware of my severe, monthly premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Now, when I am going through menopause, he is more patient towards my transition. I cannot help my depressive spells or mood swings and hot flashes, but I am definitely aware of my triggers and the reason why it is happening.

I am better equipped to handle the stress. I meditate, take long hot showers, do some brisk walking or gardening to release the pressure of coping with menopausal hormonal changes. I believe setting some time for myself and doing the things I want helps me adjust to such changes mentally.

The reason I am pointing this out is because, until recently, we as a society were not mindful of a woman's hormonal fluctuations that she deals with daily. You feel hot at one point of the night and have the air conditioner at full blast, and a while later you are in socks and layers of clothing. You feel hot and then cold in the middle of the night, a very common phenomenon in women. The constant brain fog because of lack of sleep affects your daily productivity.

Facing difficulty in sleeping, emotional changes, irritability, mood swings or mild depression are normal for menopausal women, along with racing hearts, headaches, joint and muscle aches and pains, weight gain, hair loss or thinning, and sagging of skin. These experiences are all part of your body adjusting to ageing, and this can last for five to ten years.

Women need not suffer for these and they must learn to seek medical help. It's also the people around them who need to be empathetic to their mental and physical changes and well-being.

You need to learn how to regulate your diet and the foods that trigger certain reactions. The sudden onset of multi-joint pain will force you to start exercising regularly. The adjustments you need to make are mostly about food and exercise, listening to your body, and trying to learn as much as possible about this stage of your life.

The initial physical changes will be scary, but a supportive husband/partner can be extremely helpful in learning to deal with bad tempers, mood swings, and other elements of this natural transition.

It is only right to address these symptoms of hormonal changes with tender loving care. It is vital to talk about and listen to her; she needs support and to feel loved and taken care of through this phase of life.

690,What Bangladesh's new budget should offer to common people,"On June 1, 2023, the finance minister is set to present the national budget for the 2023-24 fiscal year in parliament. This particular budget poses significant challenges – arguably the most challenging in recent times – for economic policymaking in Bangladesh. The current geopolitical and geoeconomic situations are unfavourable, and the world is still grappling with the aftermath of the pandemic and the fallout of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

The multifaceted challenges have resulted in an overall lower economic growth around the world, with some economies facing recession-like situations. In April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) updated its projection of global growth, showing a rocky recovery. The IMF projects that in 2023, the global economic growth will fall to 2.8 percent from 3.4 percent in 2022, and eventually settle at 3 percent in 2024.

Bangladesh's economy is also going through several challenges. These include the burden of high prices, pressure on the external sector, fluctuating foreign exchange rates, and a decline in foreign exchange reserves. Additionally, the country continues to face long-standing issues such as insufficient domestic resource mobilisation, low and stagnant private investment, inadequate public expenditure capacity, youth unemployment, and socioeconomic inequality. Even though the poverty rate has been declining over the past decade, as per the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the recently published Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2022 revealed that inequality has increased. For example, in the HIES 2010, the Gini coefficient was 0.458, which increased to 0.482 in HIES 2016. In HIES 2022, the Gini coefficient has gone up to 0.499.

Given the current global and domestic circumstances, the upcoming annual budget must incorporate strategies to tackle immediate challenges while also addressing medium-term issues. The persistence of a global economic downturn and inflationary pressures, compounded by the ongoing war, necessitates a comprehensive response from the government. To effectively confront this crisis, it is imperative for the government to coordinate fiscal and monetary policy measures. Additionally, specific measures tailored to combat these challenges should be implemented.

First, the government should eliminate various taxes – such as advance income tax, advance tax, and regulatory duty – imposed on all imported essential items. Social protection programmes should be expanded to include direct cash support for the impoverished. To cater to the needs of low-income groups, there should be an abundant supply of essential items in the open market, available at reduced prices through operations such as open market sale (OMS). Moreover, the tax-free income threshold should be increased to Tk 3.5 lakh for the low-income households.

Second, although the government is committed to eliminating subsidies, as per the IMF conditionalities for the $4.7 billion loan, this measure needs careful thinking. Subsidy management has to be in a targeted manner so that poor and low-income households are not affected. For example, agriculture subsidies for fertilisers and pesticides need to be sustained to avoid food insecurity. Given the global price and supply constraints, and limited fiscal space in the country, the government must adopt a rational policy measure to feed its large population. Furthermore, it is crucial to ensure fair prices for farmers in the agricultural sector, which will incentivise increased production and subsequently lead to a greater supply in the market. The government should strengthen its market monitoring mechanism to identify and penalise hoarders who create artificial crises. They should also ensure enough supplies in the market to avoid domestic market crises.

Third, to meet the growing demand for increased and affordable supply in the market, financial support is essential. Therefore, policymakers must focus on creating sufficient fiscal space by implementing strategies for domestic resource mobilisation. Understandably, reduction of taxes on essential items will subsequently lower import taxes. To compensate for the potential revenue loss, higher taxes on luxury goods can be imposed. The government is already imposing higher taxes on many luxury items. However, while this may serve as an immediate solution to generate additional revenue and meet the increased financial requirements, the ultimate objective should be to enhance revenue through the collection of income tax. Reforming the existing revenue collection system is the pre-condition for achieving this objective. The government should prioritise the establishment of an independent and fully automated tax system, supported by adequate and efficient human resources.

Fourth, the government should exercise caution while attempting to reduce expenditure, ensuring that it does not result in a drastic decline in government spending, a contraction of domestic demand, or a negative impact on investment. This is crucial because a combination of high inflation and weak economic growth can worsen the current situation. It is imperative for the government to increase its expenditure in crucial areas such as healthcare, education, and social protection. The social sector has been chronically neglected due to insufficient efforts in revenue generation and competing priorities, particularly in physical infrastructure. Consequently, these sectors receive minimal budgetary allocations as a percentage of GDP. However, if economic growth is not accompanied by an appropriate allocation of resources to the social sector, the sustainability of this growth will be jeopardised. Insufficient allocation of public resources to these sectors will further exacerbate societal inequality.

Fifth, while the national budget has certain limitations in addressing medium- and long-term issues, it plays a crucial role in determining resource allocation and generation for each financial year. Although the budget tends to follow an incremental approach, it has the ability to make choices and decisions within the broader national policy frameworks that are designed with medium- to long-term objectives in mind. Consequently, the annual budget is expected to not only devise short-term fiscal measures, but also allocate resources towards medium-term objectives, ensuring a continued focus on long-term goals. The budget should be formulated keeping these perspectives in mind.

691,"In Pakistan, a mass reckoning remains unlikely","Supporters of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan protest against his arrest in Hyderabad, on May 9, 2023. PHOTO: REUTERS

When this spin of the political merry-go-round pauses, one image will linger: a young man, veiled by his blue surgical mask, clinging to a bewildered peacock.

The peacock had been looted from the Lahore corps commander's house in the wake of Imran Khan's arrest, an ill-thought-out gesture to reclaim what rightfully belonged to the people. One wonders what became of that peacock, and one fears for its welfare. Its fate is an apt metaphor for the prospect of a mass political mobilisation in Pakistan.

The unprecedented events of recent days have again stirred the question: is a revolution coming? Social media is flooded with videos of angry young men pillaging the corps commander's house, smashing candelabras and burning furniture, disgusted to find frozen strawberries in an elite kitchen in the same country where food inflation is running well over 40 percent and most people are struggling to eat two square meals a day.

That unthinkable moment when people pushed through the gates of GHQ has raised tantalising prospects that the status quo might yet be challenged.

Indeed, there are several revolutionary ingredients in the mix: soaring inflation, polarised politics, a weaponised society with nothing to lose, and a new ability to smash the sacred cows of previously untouchable elite institutions. But despite the unrest and white smoke plumes of tear gas, a mass reckoning remains unlikely.

This is because public agitation continues to be reactionary and aimed at destroying, rather than visionary and aimed at creating (a new paradigm, a new society, a new status quo). If there is a mass movement brewing, it's all ""anti"" and not enough ""pro."" And history has taught us that you can't build anything from hate.

The lack of issue-based mobilisation – even at this critical time – is a reflection of Pakistan's paucity of issue-based politics. In an authoritarian state that has been under military rule for much of its history, politics has always been a game of survival, rather than a public service. The resulting distortions in the country's political discourse are all aimed at weakening opponents and appeasing puppet masters.

These distortions are now reflected in Pakistan's mass mobilisations: there is rage and rejection, but little in the way of grassroots activism. We know what we don't want, but we have never dared to ask for what we could have.

Many of the key ingredients of a successful revolution remain missing: credible leadership (beyond a cult personality), a free media that can support and disseminate a movement's messaging, and a population that understands the need for structural change and is ready to participate based on perceived benefits.

Pakistan's young, urban population should fulfil this last criteria, but the prevalence of misinformation, conspiracy theories, and the shambles that is our public education sector has limited the critical requirement for understanding.

Ironically, the closest we have come to mass reform movements in recent years is in the form of the TTP or other similar religio-political movements. These comprised a rejection of the status quo and offered an alternative vision as articulated in concrete demands (for example, regarding the imposition of Shariah law).

It is not surprising that the TTP – despite killing tens of thousands of Pakistanis – enjoyed some traction (albeit ambivalent) with the public for over a decade. That itself is a testament to Pakistanis' hunger for issue-based politics.

There have, of course, also been recent attempts at mass movements without a violent extremist bent. Think of the PTM or the Haq Do Tehreek in Gwadar, which offered progressive politics and a specific people-oriented agen­­da.

Unfortuna­tely, status quo beneficiaries in Pakistan know a meaningful mass mo­­vement threat when they see one; they ma­­naged to nullify these groups' leadership through extended jail terms and contain them with media bla­c­kouts.

The comparison between the imprisonment tenures of Imran Khan and Ali Wazir offers a clue as to which movement has more potential to actually effect change.

In the West, there is a growing recognition that mass mobilisations that challenge the status quo will only occur – and succeed – if they can offer a political alternative that is rooted in specific pro-people demands. Climate change activists, for example, are increasingly seeking to align with labour movements or minority rights' movements in order to embed abstract net-zero demands into a progressive vision that privileges equality, human rights, and security.

The number of issues around which Pakistanis should be coalescing is staggering: food security, safety, dignity of work, free speech, minority rights, welfare protections, healthcare provisions, climate resilience. Until we can craft a politics that champions for the people rather than against their overlords, our future will be riot, not reform.

692,Only Connect: The Radical Empathy of Mrinal Sen,"In a few days, the whole world will celebrate the centenary of Sen: the man who changed India's cinematic landscape forever. As this will inspire a lot of fresh reflections on his cinema, I can guess that there will be a lot of focus on Sen's formal experimentation and the uncompromising political conviction of his subjects. Yet, for me, the man Mrinal Sen can never be summed up only through his cinematic output alone. Unlike many of his (equally illustrious) cinematic contemporaries, his most profound contribution to the field of Indian art and culture is in this radical and self-reflective empathy: guided by his sense of warmth, unpretentious sense of humor (once during a sound check with a Belgian documentary crew he introduced himself as the ""King of Belgium"" with a straight face) and an all-around collaborative spirit. This sincere desire to connect and converse with others with unfeigned sincerity makes the stature of the man Mrinal Sen even more valuable than his incredible cinematic oeuvre. Sen's spirit of belonging to the community requires greater attention in our anxious, paranoid, and narcissistic times. This December it will be the fifth anniversary of this death in late 2018. I was in Kolkata for Christmas vacation when the news of his death reached us. My father has been a film critic and journalist for many decades and conversed with Sen on many occasions in both formal and informal capacities. As the sense of loss in our house was personal and profound, my father recalled how Sen would solidly grip the shoulders of colleagues and journalists in Nandan or other adjoining areas during long hours of interaction. Many of Sen's colleagues fondly recall that embrace of solidarity and presence, including directors like Gautam Ghose or Sen's protégé Anjan Dutt.

A poster of Mrinal Sen’s acclaimed film Baishe Srabon.

This spirit of reaching out has constantly provided the rich creative amplitude of Sen's films. He made feature and documentary films in five Indian languages: Bengali, English, Hindi, Odiya, and Telugu. This is a feat unmatched by even his contemporaries Ray and Ghatak. Just like them, Sen constantly looked for inspiration from literary sources, but Sen's literary influences and inspirations were uniquely pan-Indian, which further testifies to his position as one of the most important *Indian* filmmakers of the last century.

Sen's debut film Raat Bhore (1955) was based on the eponymous novel by Bengali writer Swaraj Bandyopadhyay, published only two years ago in 1953. Sen would later consider his debut film to be a forgettable experience. For his next film, Neel Akasher Niche Sen adapted the short story Chini Feriwala by prominent Hindi writer Mahadevi Varma (1907-1987). Sen's first film to prominently feature Calcutta as a backdrop, the film told the story of a Chinese immigrant street vendor (played by Kali Banerjee) in the city forming a platonic yet tender relationship with a Bengali house wife, played by Manju Dey. Another one of Sen's early films, Pratinidhi ( released in 1965, now sadly lost) is based on the novel Pracchadpat, by Bengali writer Achintya Kumar Sengupta (1903-1976). Sen's earlier film Punashcha (1961) too was adapted from a story by Sengupta. Akash Kusum (1965) was adapted directly for the screen by Sen's long-time comrade and collaborator Ashish Barman (1927-2002) who also wrote the stories of Interview and Padatik. Sen's first foray into Odia film, Matira Manisha (Man of the Soil, 1966) was based on the eponymous novel by noted Odia polymath Kalindi Charan Panigrahi (1901-1991). Later for Mrigayaa (1976), he would adopt another Odia short story, Shikar, by Bhagabati Charan Panigrahi (1908-1943), one of the most fiercely political writers in Odia literature, and a staunch Communist activist.

Bhuvan Shome (1969), the pathbreaking Indian New Wave film that catapulted Sen to the national and international stage was made in Hindi. But it was based on a charming Bengali novel published in 1957 by Balai Chand Mukhopadhyay (1899-1979), a physician cum writer who wrote under the pseudonym Banaphul (the wildflower). Sen's next Hindi film Ek Adhuri Kahani (An Unfinished Story, 1972) too was based on a Bengali story: Gotrantar by Subodh Ghosh (1909-1980). Probably among Sen's most well-known works, Calcutta 71 (1972), is an anthology film, featuring four interlinked stories about the social and political crisis of the times. At least three of the four storylines were based on short stories written between the 1930s and early 1950s, by writers steeped in then emergent progressive and realist tradition of Bengali literature: Manik Bandyopadhyay, Samaresh Basu and Prabodh Kumar Sanyal. Manik Bandyopadhyay (1908-1956) was probably the most active political thinker among the trio. His story Atmahatyar Adhikar (The Right to Suicide) was set in 1933. It is about the plight of a working-class family during a night of torrential rain in a city slum. Prabodh Sanyal's (1905-1983) Angar (Ember) is the second story, set during the devastating year of the Bengal famine of 1943. Sen again turns our attention to a working-class family of a mother and two daughters driven to prostitution by hunger. The third story is by Samaresh Basu (1924-1988), a writer who was a dedicated Communist worker in his youth, even going to prison for his belief. His story, Esmalgar (The Smuggler) is about a bunch of teenagers smuggling rice. The final story was written directly for the screen by its main protagonist, Ajitesh Bandyopadhyay (1933-1983). Bandyopadhyay was a doyen of Bengali theater who had translated many plays into Bengali. He was also one of the founding members of the theater group Nandikar. The story too is the most theatrical both in the setting and the narrative structure among the four. Later, for Chorus (1974) and Parasuram (1979) Sen would collaborate with another well-known contemporary thespian and playwright, Mohit Chattopadhyay (1934-2012). Chorus probably has the most surrealistic elements in all of Sen's films, yet it was based on real-life scenes of youth desperation and mass unemployment on the streets of Calcutta observed by Sen himself, and his co-writer Golam Kuddus.

Mrinal Sen’s memoir Tritiyo Bhuban

For Oka Oori Katha (The Marginal Ones, 1977) Sen again took a radical step to broaden his creative horizon, by visualizing Kafan, a Hindi story by Munshi Premchand (1880-1936), but making it in Telugu. A scathing tale of social injustice in rural India, the film was acclaimed nationally and internationally. For two of his films, Sen collaborated closely with his comrade Amalendu Chakraborty (1934-2009), a progressive writer and school teacher. Sen's Akaler Sandhaney (In Search of Famine, 1982) was made on the basis of a novelistic draft by Chakraborty. The film would actually precede the publication of the full version of the novel in 1982 by Dey's, a noted Bengali publisher. Previously, for Ekdin Pratidin (And Quiet Rolls the Dawn, 1979) he collaborated with Chakraborty, basing it on his novel Abirata Chenamukh. Another masterpiece of his ""Absence Trilogy,""Kharij (The Case is Closed, 1982) is based on Ramapada Chowdhury's (1922-2018) novel of the same name. It brutally exposes the hypocrisies of Bengali middle-class morality. For his 1989 Hindi film Ek Din Achanak (Suddenly, One Day; 1989) Sen would turn to Chowdhury for inspiration again, basing it on the writer's novel Beej (Seed). The film, which also has one of the earliest cinematic references to the then-emerging Metro Railway Service in Calcutta, is about the sudden disappearance of a college professor, and his family's struggle to cope with the reality of the situation.

Utpal Dutt in a still from Chorus

Khandhar (Ruins, 1984) was based on Premendra Mitra's (1904-1988) short story Telenapota Abishkar (Discovering Telenapota). Sen's most conceptually ambitious (Yet clumsily executed) film Genesis (1986) was based on a Samaresh Basu short story. Mahaprithibi (World Within, World Without, 1991) is about the Post-Cold War global order and anticipates the effect of the neoliberal turn in the everyday lived realities of Bengali middle-class life presciently. The story was directly written for the screen by Anjan Dutt, who also acts in it. In the elder son's (played by Victor Banerjee) return from Germany, one could find some hints of the autobiographical experience of the author, as Dutt himself worked in Germany as a theater worker in the 1980s. Sen's penultimate film Antareen (The Confined, 1993) is based on a 1950 Urdu short story by Saadat Hasan Manto (1912-1955), titled Badshahat ka Khatimah. For his final film Amar Bhuvan (This, My Land:2002) Sen chose to work on the novel Dhan Jyotsna by Afsar Ahmed (1959-2018).

This tracing and indexing of Sen's multilingual oeuvre is crucial, as it signals a critical aspect of his creative personality. Sen was not just an ""avant-garde maverick"" with an edgy style and radical; politics. For Sen, who referred to himself as a ""private Marxist"", filmmaking was intimately connected to his broad and immersive readings in literature, and his sensitive understanding of Indian history. Such a capacious range of inspiration too contributed to the generosity of his spirit, and forever cements his place in the broader artistic community of India, and not just the cinematic community. This also explains Sen's broader international appeal among writers of great stature, for example his friendship with Nobel Prize winning Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez (1927-2014). Sen and Garcia Marquez met for the first time as fellow juries for Cannes Film Festival in 1982. By then, Garcia Marquez, who had a very good knowledge of international cinema, had already seen Khandhar and Genesis. They met again and spent a lot of time together as fellow juries for the Moscow Film Festival in 1986. Sen was invited to visit Escuela Internacional de Cine y TV (EICTV) film school established by Garcia Marquez just outside Havana, in Cuba. They bonded well there and maintained a warm relationship thereon. Such international outreach, going beyond the lucrative film markets of the global north, is sadly missing among most contemporary mainstream Bengali filmmakers, for whom literary adaptation is largely motivated by extraction of the ""brand value"" of the original story. Would most of them have the courage to choose from such a variety of sources, as Sen did?

A scene from Chaalchitra

Yet, for Sen, more important than choosing a broad range of stories to tell was the consciousness of who gets to tell these stories, and how. He has always been remarkably self-reflexive about the ethics of cinematic representation (the 1971 film Interview would be a good example) in his films. In his later works, especially, Sen showed a deep understanding of how cinematic subjects are intimately bound to an interrelated media landscape globally, controlling and reflecting the consumerist realities of middle-class lives around the world. A wonderful example of this is his unreleased film Chaalchitra (Kaleidoscope, 1981). Being one of the rare films for which Sen received solo writing credit, it is a good example to conclude this essay. As the film progresses, we quickly appreciate the reason behind this, especially knowing Sen's quirky and self-reflexive persona. In the film, Calcutta's crisis is not a grand narrative principle but filled with much more proximate uncertainties and suspense: just like the speculations on the suave, urbane gentleman stripping down to his bare minimum underwear in his ramshackle apartment in the city. Anjan Dutt (in his debut film performance) plays Dipu: a young and eager journalist in search of a breakthrough story, an ""intimate study"" of his own ""middle-class milieu"", commissioned by the editor of a leading city newspaper (played by Utpal Dutt). Dipu's effort to find a sellable story starts from his own courtyard in his shared accommodation, capturing a cleaning spree of the space headed by the women of the household. Yet every effort by Dipu to find a kaleidoscopic portrait of his clan goes in vain. As Dipu struggles to find his subject matter, the city emerges as an atmospherically distended landscape of precarious matter: starch, coal, smoke, hand fans, insecticides, moss, steel, and other material assemblages that are always situated in hazardous conditions. This precarious assemblage of quotidian crises emerges as the real ""scandal"" that mainstream media is in search of. Sen's Calcutta here is not just a simplistically portrayed ""post-colonial"" city, it is also very much a part of a global network of consumerism, ""a shopping center"", as described by Dutt's character. This vulgar yet vital consumer ecology, where astrologers tout their English-speaking skills in front of unsuspecting Western tourists, is Sen's creative inspiration. In a crucial sequence of the film, Dipu's younger brother Apu (played by a young Kaushik Sen) asks him, looking over the roofs of hyper-contiguously situated houses in their neighborhood: how many ovens are there in Calcutta? Instantly, Dipu finds his breakthrough topic. Yet, he still cannot extract a story from the subject of smoke. Unlike his editor, for Dipu, ""smoke is not a positive nuisance"", but rather a necessary and integral aspect of working-class lives in the city. Sen reframes our understanding of pollution purely from an ecological issue to a fundamental lens through which we look at Calcutta's social, cultural, and ecological crises.

Such attention to both the human and non-human agency is a key aspect of understanding Sen's late cinematic style. It complements his radical materialist politics. As we celebrate the first hundred years of Mrinal Sen's extraordinary life, we should pay attention to this larger politics, whose potential transcends the scope of any archive.

693,Why Sampadak Parishad opposes the Digital Security Act,"Reprint of what we published on 29th September, 2018

After the enactment of the Digital Security Act (DSA) in 2018, the Sampadak Parishad published an elaborate Section by Section analysis of the objectionable parts and gave a detailed response as to how this law impinged on the operation of free and independent media and why DSA should be repealed or fundamentally amended.

The experience of the last four and half years proves the correctness of our initial concerns and strengthens our demand for repealing the Act.

Originally, we reproduced the Bangla versions of the Act along with our translation as the official English translation of the DSA was not available. In the present reprint below we have replaced the Bangla text (and translation) with the official English version of DSA. For the sake of brevity and improved readability, we have also made some modifications. (Please refer to the original article through this link: https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/why-sampadak-parishad-opposes-the-digital-security-act-1640269)

1. The Act ends up policing media operations, censoring content and controlling media freedom and freedom of speech and expression as guaranteed by our constitution.

2. The Act gives unlimited power to the police to arrest without warrant, enter premises, search offices, bodily search persons, seize computers, computer networks, servers, and everything related to the digital platforms.

3. The Act suffers from vagueness and uses many terms that can be misinterpreted and used against the media. Laws must be clear, specific and meticulously defined. A vague law is a weapon of misuse and as such oppression of the media.

4. DSA will create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation which will make journalism and especially investigative journalism virtually impossible.

5. The law will not only create panic among media professionals, but also among all users of computers, computer networks, and related technologies.

6. The purpose of the law as mentioned in its preamble is ""ensuring digital security and identification, prevention, suppression and trial of offences committed through digital device and for matters ancillary thereto"". However, its use over the last four and half years provide irrefutable proof that its purpose has been to curb freedom of the media, freedom of expression and all related freedoms.

7. The law goes against the very nature and practice of independent journalism that stands to protect people's right to know and exposes abuse of power and corruption.

8. While other fields, like cyber security, may require ""regulations"" media needs ""freedom"". The DSA is focused only on the ""regulation"" and totally neglects the ""freedom"" aspect that the media needs.

9. A frightening aspect of the DSA is the enormous arbitrary power given to the police who may arrest, without warrant, a journalist just on suspicion of a so-called crime that police think may be committed in the future. In practical terms, this will bring journalism under police control.

10. It is alarming that out of the 20 or so provisions of the law that deal with offences and punishments, 14 are NON-BAILABLE. Five are bailable and one can be negotiated. The lowest punishment is 1 year in prison and the highest life-term but mostly in the range of between 4 and 7 years. This will inevitably create an atmosphere of FEAR and INTIMIDATION under which normal functioning of journalism will become extremely risky if not impossible.

11. Another flaw of the DSA is the level of punishment meted out to ""offenders"". Let's take the case of the Road Safety Act which was passed along with the DSA. The former provides for a maximum punishment of 5 years for killing people in road accidents while a journalist can be punished up to life-term for violating the colonial era Official Secrets Act (1923).

SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS AND OUR OBSERVATIONS

Below we present a detailed analysis as to why Sampadak Parishad (Editors' Council) considers this law to be anti-free press, against freedom of speech and antithetical to democracy. To ensure the accuracy of our analysis, we have referred to the official English text of the Act, which was published on October 6, 2019.""

SECTION 8

Power to remove or block some data-information. (1) If any data-information related to any matter under the jurisdiction of the Director General, being published or propagated in digital media, creates threat to digital security, the Director General may request the Bangladesh Telecommunications and Regulatory Commission, hereinafter referred to as BTRC, to remove or, as the case may be, block the said data-information.

(2) If it appears to the law and order enforcing force that any data-information published or propagated in digital media hampers the solidarity, financial activities, security, defence, religious values or public discipline of the country or any part thereof, or incites racial hostility and hatred, the law and order enforcing force may request BTRC to remove or block the data-information through the Director General.

(3) If BTRC is requested under sub-sections (1) and (2), it shall, with intimation to the Government of the said matters, instantly remove or, as the case may be, block the data-information.

(4) For carrying out the purposes of this section, other necessary matters shall be prescribed by rules.

SAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT

There are two issues of concern here -- the power of the Director General and the power of the law enforcement agencies. The power to block contents will hit the heart of publication either in print or online. Any report may be blocked or a photograph may be confiscated that may lead to disruption of any media outlet.

The justifications needed to remove or block content are too vague and subject to individual interpretation, leaving room for the abuse of the law. For example, if a journalist exposes corruption in a project, and this leads to the project's financing being stopped by a donor or private investor, the journalist can be accused of ""disrupting financial activities"" under this law, which can then lead to the blocking or removal of their content.

SECTION 21

Punishment for making any kind of propaganda or campaign against liberation war, spirit of liberation war, father of the nation, national anthem or national flag. (1) If any person, by means of digital medium, makes or instigates to make any propaganda or campaign against the liberation war of Bangladesh, spirit of liberation war, father of the nation, national anthem or national flag, then such act of the person shall be an offence.

SAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT

We are fully committed to the preservation of the dignity and correct history of our Liberation War and given the past experience of attempts at its distortion we understand the need to do something in this regard. However, ""Spirit of Liberation War"" is a rather vague term. Without further defining the ""crimes"" under this section and clearly specifying what constitutes a ""crime"", we run the risk of serious abuse of this law and harassment of journalists and the punishment is up to life-term or (and) Tk 3 crore in fine or both.

""Mukti Juddher Chetona"" (Spirit of Liberation War) is a vague term and is very subjective and cases can be brought against journalists as interpretations can vary.

We reiterate that we are in favour of protecting the great legacy of our Liberation War for the future generations. However, when laws are being framed, we need to be very clear and specific. Given its present form, not only journalists but historians, researchers and even creative writers like novelists will also suffer. It may even result in people not writing or researching much on our Liberation War fearing misinterpretation and the possibility of punishment.

SECTION 25

Transmission, publication, etc. of offensive, false or threatening data-information. (1) If any person, through any website or any other digital medium, (a) intentionally or knowingly transmits, publishes or propagates any data-information which he knows to be offensive, false or threatening in order to annoy, insult, humiliate or malign a person; or (b) publishes or propagates or abets to publish or propagate any information, as a whole or partly, which he knows to be propaganda or false, with an intention to affect the image or reputation of the country, or to spread confusion, then such act of the person shall be an offence.

SAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT

This will directly affect all investigative reporting in the media. Such reports are usually about some irregularities performed by institutions and individuals. Corrupt people will use this law to intimidate journalists and media organizations and try to prevent publication of such stories on the pretext that the reports have attacked or intimidated them. Actually, every such report can be said to fall under one or more of the above categories and can be used to harass the media.

Any investigative report that reveals corruption about a person or an institution is bound to ""irritate"", ""embarrass"" or ""humiliate"" someone. This provision will make it impossible to publish any negative report about any corrupt person. This will reduce newspapers to PR outfits. Journalism of even the most rudimentary investigative nature will become impossible.

The second part of this provision talks about ""spreading confusion"". Without specifying the meaning of ""confusion"", it may become a weapon of media harassment. What is confusing to one may not be confusing to another. This will surely create a new avenue to intimidate the media.

Then again, what constitutes damaging the ""image or reputation"" of the State? Recently we have reported about the corruption in the banking sector by unscrupulous business groups. We have reported that the banks face grim crisis. Does it constitute damaging the ""image or reputation""? We have reported corruption in the law enforcement agencies. We have reported on ""custodial deaths"" ""disappearances"", and ""extra-judicial killings"". If someone interprets all these reports as damaging to the ""image"" of the State then this law legalises punishment of journalists and newspapers for making such reports, as all newspapers have websites.

SECTION 28

Publication, broadcast, etc. of information in website or in any electronic format that hurts the religious values or sentiment. (1) If any person or group willingly or knowingly publishes or broadcasts or causes to publish or broadcast anything in website or any electronic format which hurts religious sentiment or values, with an intention to hurt or provoke the religious values or sentiments, then such act of the person shall be an offence.

SAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT

The term ""religious sentiment"" is an undefined term. How can a reporter know how and when religious sentiment has been hurt? This term lends itself to diverse interpretations and no journalist will feel comfortable about reporting on such issues. This will prevent journalistic scrutiny over a large area of the society. The recent reporting on the sexual harassment by catholic priests would not have been possible if those countries had a law preventing reporting that ""hurts"" religious sentiments. Criticizing unlawful fatwa or women's property rights may be interpreted by some as ""hurting"" their religious values. This section can lead to widespread harassment of journalists.

SECTION 29

Publication, transmission, etc. of defamatory information. (1) If any person publishes or transmits any defamatory information as described in section 499 of the Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860) in website or in any other electronic format, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 (three) years, or with fine not exceeding Taka 5 (five) lac, or with both.

SAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT

A law already exists to deal with defamation and so a separate law for digital media is not needed. Furthermore, there is no justification for imposing harsher penalties for the same offense committed through digital media than for print media.

SECTION 31

Offence and punishment for deteriorating law and order, etc. (1) If any person intentionally publishes or transmits anything in website or digital layout that creates enmity, hatred or hostility among different classes or communities of the society, or destroys communal harmony, or creates unrest or disorder, or deteriorates or advances to deteriorate the law and order situation, then such act of the person shall be an offence.

SAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT

A news concerning discrimination of Dalits, or ethnic groups and exploitation of disadvantaged groups may be interpreted as causing disaffection between different sections of the society. Any news highlighting plights of the people of Chittagong Hill Tracts may be interpreted as ""creating unrest"" among different communities. Similarly, news about possible labour unrest, impending hartal or demonstration can be construed as reports that are ""creating law and order situation"" and thus bring action under this law. There could be a story that a person has died in a demonstration which may later prove to be untrue. Will the media be ""guilty of spreading rumour""? Such errors regularly occur in reporting which are corrected immediately. In Bangladesh death figures from floods, cyclones or even roads accidents vary. Government figures are always at variance with privately gathered figures. In such cases according to the DSA, media can be sued for ""spreading rumour"". Sometimes reports may forecast certain developments which may not exactly happen later. That also can be considered as ""spreading rumour"". Thus, we find this section as seriously jeopardizing freedom of journalism.

SECTION 32

Offence and punishment for breaching secrecy of the Government. (1) If any person commits or abets to commit an offence under the Official Secrets Act, 1923 (Act No. XIX of 1923) by means of computer, digital device, computer network, digital network or any other digital means, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 (fourteen) years, or with fine not exceeding Taka 25 (twenty-five) lac, or with both. (2) If any person commits the offence referred to in sub-section (1) for the second time or repeatedly, he shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with fine not exceeding Taka 1 (one) crore, or with both.

SAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT

This is a sweeping restrictive law from the colonial times that was promulgated to protect the British administration from any sort of accountability. It is shocking to see it being incorporated for digital platforms. Anything that is not made public by the government is deemed an ""official secret"". Let us take one example. We have published dozens of reports about bank defaults based on Bangladesh Bank's findings. All such reports can be said to have violated the Official Secrets Act. All government reports which have not been made public, say, on pollution or child nutrition, are a part of the Official Secrets Act. Is journalism of any worth possible without the use of such official reports? And why should using them be a ""crime"" as people have a ""Right to Know"" under the RTI Act, especially when all such reports are funded by public money.

Could we have done any of the reporting on default loans, gross irregularities in Farmers' Bank or Basic Bank without Bangladesh Bank or government departments' reports which were yet to be made public? And our reporters often use their mobile phones to take pictures of such documents. So, under this law, journalists can be thrown in jail up to life-term?

SECTION 43

Search, seizure and arrest without warrant. (1) If any police officer has reasons to believe that an offence under this Act has been or is being committed, or is likely to be committed in any place, or any evidence is likely to be lost, destroyed, deleted or altered or made unavailable in any way, then he may, for reasons of such belief to be recorded in writing, proceed with the following measures, namely:

(a) to enter and search the place, and if obstructed, to take necessary measures in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure;

(b) to seize the computer, computer system, computer network, data-information or other materials used in committing the offence or any document supportive to prove the offence;

(c) to search the body of any person present in the place;

(d) to arrest any person present in the place if the person is suspected to have committed or be committing an offence under this Act.

(2) After concluding search under sub-section (1), the police officer shall submit a report on such search to the Tribunal.

SAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT

This is by far the most dangerous of the provisions of the law.

This empowers the police to enter any premises, search any computer system, seize any computer network and its servers, bodily search any body and also ARREST anybody on suspicion.

First, the threat of arrest without warrant will naturally prevent a journalist from doing their work. When police get the power to arrest without warrant, and on mere SUSPICION then media freedom will be buried under this law. Given the fact that 14 out of 20 provisions of punishment are NON-BAILABLE the threat of arrest becomes like the ""Damocles' Sword"" constantly hanging over the head of every journalist, causing mental stress. This will prevent all forms of real journalism and make our media nothing more than public relations and propaganda outlets.

Even if the law is not implemented (and why not if the law exists?) the environment of fear will prevent journalists from doing their job. The fear of arrest will become a regular part of the ""mental environment"" and desist a journalist from taking legitimate risks that he or she regularly take to file their stories. The ""emotional stress"" that it will create should not be underestimated. It can easily be expected that people in power will abuse this law, provoke or ""manage"" law enforcers to threaten or even arrest journalists for any story that will reveal something that the rich and powerful will want to hide.

The most dangerous side of this law is that since every newspaper and TV station works on digital system, by giving the power to confiscate a computer, a network of computers including servers, the law enforcing agencies have been given, in effect, the power to shut down a newspaper or TV station or a news portal by confiscating its computers, computer system, computer network and other equipment. Thus, without closing down a media outlet, this clause opens up the possibility of stopping the publication of a newspaper or the operation of a TV station by the law enforcing agencies.

SECTION 53

Offences to be cognizable and bailable. --In this Act --

(a) the offences specified in sections 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 shall be cognizable and non-bailable;

(b) the offences specified in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 18, sections 20, 25, 29 and sub-section (3) of section 47 shall be non-cognizable and bailable;

(c) the offences specified in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 18 shall be non-cognizable, bailable and subject to the permission of the court, be compoundable; and

(d) the offences, if committed by a person for the second time or more, shall be cognizable and non-bailable.

SAMPADAK PARISHAD'S COMMENT

Under this law out of the 20 or so provisions dealing with crimes and punishment,14 are cognizable and NON-BAILABLE. Given the fact that police have the power to arbitrarily arrest without warrant and on mere suspicion, this law presents a real threat to media freedom as so many offences have been made cognizable and non-bailable.

CONCLUSION

1. The Digital Security Act (DSA) clearly violates the citizens' Constitutional Right to freedom of speech and expression and freedom of the press, guaranteed in our most sacred document, the Constitution, with reasonable restrictions.

2. This law violates the spirit of our Liberation War and the high ideals of freedom that our martyrs laid down their lives for.

3. This law is against the fundamentals of democracy, democratic governance and all the rights that our people fought for repeatedly during our struggle against the Pakistani rule and against all martial law regimes after 1971.

4. The Digital Security Act is against all the fundamental values of ethical and independent journalism.

5. The Digital Security Act is in contradiction with the Right to Information Act.

We have explained in detail and made a section-by-section analysis as to why the Digital Security Act is against our Constitution, against our fundamental fights, against freedom of speech and freedom of press and as such against democracy.

It is thus that the Sampadak Parishad is forced to reject this law.

694,The Struggle for Justice and Dignity,"A historical timeline of the labour movement in Bangladesh

Tea labourers demand that May 20 be recognized by the state as Tea Workers’ Day.

Sashipada Banerjee, founder of Working Men’s Club (1870)

The labour movement in Bangladesh has a rich and complex history that dates back to the 19th century. From the struggle for independence from British colonial rule to the fight for workers' rights and better working conditions, the labour movement has played a critical role in shaping the country's political and economic landscape.

Here is a comprehensive timeline of the labour movement in Bangladesh, highlighting key events and milestones that have shaped the movement's trajectory. From the early days of colonial rule to the present day, the timeline documents the challenges and successes faced by workers in their quest for justice and dignity. By examining the historical context of the labour movement, we hope to shed light on the ongoing struggles faced by workers in Bangladesh and inspire further action towards a more equitable future.

–Priyam Paul & Shamsuddoza Sajen, The Daily Star

April 16, 1853

The beginning of the modern industrial worker in the Indian Subcontinent is marked by the inauguration of the railway line from Mumbai to Thane.

Mohini Mill, Kushtia

April-May, 1862

Indian railway men of Howrah Railway Station joined the first ever strike demanding an 8-hours-a-day working hour.

1870

Sashipada Banerjee established the Working Men's Club which is considered to be the first labour organization in Bengal. In the same year, he started publishing Bharat Sramajibi (Indian Laborers), a journal exclusively devoted to the labourers, from Kolkata.

1881

With the aim of improving the working conditions of laborers, the Indian Factories Act was enacted. The Act prohibited the employment of children below the age of 7 and set a limit of nine hours for their daily work. It was enforced on July 1, 1881.

On November 29, 1907, the Greenock Telegraph and Clyde Shipping Gazette, a Scottish newspaper, published a report on the railway strike in Bengal.

1891

The Indian Factories Act of 1881 underwent an amendment that included a provision for a weekly holiday. The revised Act also restricted the employment of women and children to the period between 5 o'clock in the morning and 8 o'clock in the evening, with a maximum daily working period of eleven hours for women. The minimum age for child labor was raised from 7 to 9 years, and the maximum daily working hours for children were capped at seven.

1905

The Swadesi movement, which arose in protest of the Partition of Bengal, provided a significant boost to the development of local industries in the region. Swadesi workers urged people to refrain from using cloth made in Lancashire or Manchester Cotton Mills. This period also saw the emergence of labour activism, with some leaders championing the cause of industrial workers to advance political agitation. In 1905, the Printers' Union was established in Calcutta. A series of strikes erupted in various mills and railways, particularly in the Eastern Bengal State Railways.

On March 25, 1911, the Advertiser, an Australian newspaper, published news about the recently amended Indian Factories Act. The report placed particular emphasis on the new 12-hour working day for adult workers.

Nov-Dec, 1907

Railway Strike in Bengal demanding wage increase. They succeeded to get a famine allowance.

Mulluk Cholo Movement. On May 20, 1921, colonial troops brutally attacked tea workers who were stranded at Chandpur railway station, reminiscent of the Jallianwala Bag massacre. The workers, seeking to escape serfdom, abandoned the tea estates in Chargola and Longlai valleys in Sylhet and marched en masse towards their hometowns. This mass exodus caused political upheaval for nearly three months, from May 3 to August 3, 1921. The tea workers' widespread strike was soon followed by equally significant strikes by workers of the Assam Bengal Railways and Inland Steamer Navigation.

December, 1922

MN Roy presented a programme of action which included the following demands: (1) Establishment of minimum wages in all industries through legislation; (2) Implementation of an eight-hour workday, limited to five and a half days a week, for male adults. Special regulations would be put in place for women and child labour; (3) Employers would be legally required to provide workers with a certain standard of comfort in regards to housing, working conditions, and medical aid; (4) Protective legislation would be enacted to provide old age, sickness, and unemployment insurance for all industries; (5) Recognition of labour organisations as legal entities, with workers' right to strike in order to enforce their demands; (6) Establishment of workers' councils in all major industries to defend labour rights, with the state providing protection for their function; and (7) Introduction of profit-sharing schemes in all large industries.

695,Honouring Mujibnagar heroes,"The untold story 18 BSF Battalion’s contribution to the oath taking ceremony and thereafter

April 17, 1971, is a historic day that shines brightly in the collective memory of Bangladesh with immense pride, unwavering strength, and boundless enthusiasm. It marks the moment when the world witnessed the birth of a free Bangladesh on the global stage. In a small, uncharted corner of the newly emerged Bangladesh, countless remarkable and unexpected events unfolded. Thousands of people gathered with a resolute purpose, laying the political, constitutional, and geographical foundation of our newfound state. This day remains an indelible beacon in the annals of history, cherished by those who contributed to its creation. It also symbolizes the invaluable support of our friendly neighbor, India, in our journey towards existential glory.

The Indian Border Security Force (BSF) provided crucial assistance, including deploying urgently needed security measures, to thwart any potential incursion from Pakistan during the Oath Taking Ceremony. This was made possible through the strategic decisions orchestrated by Indira Gandhi, facilitated by Khusro Faramuz Rustamji, the DG of BSF. The entire West Bengal BSF, led by Inspector General Golok Majumder, played a pivotal role in this effort. Following Golok Majumder's instructions, Mr. Chakraborty, the Commanding Officer of BSF in Twenty Four Parganas, and his subordinate Captain Mohapatra, were deputed to guard the VIPs in the Bodyanathtala of Meherpur, disguised in civilian clothes with concealed weapons. Captain Manindra Singh Rathore of the 18th Indian BSF battalion, under the command of Colonel Megh Singh, led the security arrangement at the venue.

Allow me to recount the remarkable tale of Captain Manohar, his commanding officer Colonel Megh Singh, and their battalion 18 BSF, whose unwavering courage and dedication made a monumental contribution to the liberation war.

Assistant Commandant (Captain) Manohar Singh Rathore was a young and dynamic officer of 18 Battalion BSF. Since he had previously participated in the 1965 war in the Gurkha Regiment, his CO Lt. Col. Megh Singh appointed him as Company Commander and Mortar Platoon Commander of 18 BSF Battalion. His company, along with the Mortar platoon, was initially deployed at Meherpur to provide protection and fire support during the swearing-in ceremony of the 1st Independent Government of Bangladesh on 17th April 1971, and later at Petrapol-Benapole area.

Captain Rathore witnessed and provided protection to the Oath taking ceremony dressed as a Bangladeshi Muktijodha personnel in civilian clothes as per the direction of their CO, Lt Col. Megh Singh (who was also there with Maj. Hafiz).

I recall a conversation I had with someone who appeared to be Capt. Rathore, possibly from 18 BSF Battalion. He was wearing a whitish maroon kurta and salwar. I asked him, ""Bhai, aap idhar kyu? Aap to Indian Army ke lagte ho"". He replied, ""Mein 18 BSF Battalion ka hu aur mere ko yaha mere CO, Col. Megh Singh ne bheja hai"". I was inquisitive and asked, ""Aap yaha kya kar rahe ho""? He replied, ""Hum log idhar VIP logon ko safety dene ke liye charon taraf deployed hai. Idhar Bangladesh ka swearing-in hogi, to hum sab Pakistan attack ko nahi hone dene ke liye deployed hai. Hamari Battalion yaha civilian kapde mein deployed hai"". I replied to him, ""Bahut shukriya aap ko, hum bhi yaha hai aur Mukti Bahini Pakistani ko dekh lega."" We saluted each other and went on to our respective work. I couldn't see his personal arms, and he was wearing jungle shoes. Later, after the ceremony, I met Capt Mohapatra, who was the BSF company commander at the nearest BSF post at Changkhali, and whom I had met earlier as well. He told me that 18 BSF Battalion was providing protection at the venue of the ceremony dressed as Mukti Bahini in civilian clothes.

Capt. Manohar was subsequently deployed with his company at Petrapol-Benapole ICP, providing protection to the Bangladesh flag hoisted after the April 17, 1971 ceremony, by ensuring and assisting all defensive deployments of Mukti Bahini in the area. During the months of April and May 1971, the company supported Major Hafiz of 1st East Bengal Regiment in conducting a raid on April 21 on a Pakistan Army artillery gun position at Navaron, approximately 13 kilometers inside East Pakistan territory.

The receipt of Rupees 4.40 crore and 20 kgs of Gold collected by Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury and Mabub Uddin Ahmed from government banks and treasury of the free zones of the Kushtia district.

Major Hafiz narrates in his book about the raid and how the Muktijodhas of 1st EBR were provided with effective mortar fire to safely withdraw after the successful raid.

As the mortars were firing and it was raining heavily, the 18 BSF troops could not retrieve the two base plates from the fire position after the raid. Once the entire party reached back safely at Benapole and were being debriefed by Lt. Col. Megh Singh, it was learned that the base plates were left behind by the mortar detachments while exfiltrating in a hurry under heavy Pakistani fire. Despite knowing the gravity of the situation and the possibility of Pakistani soldiers being alert in the area, Capt. Manohar volunteered to take a few boys and retrieve the base plates.

According to Maj. Hafiz, this was a daring operation inside enemy territory, knowing fully well that the enemy was dominating that particular area. Notwithstanding, Capt. Manohar reached the firing position again at night by infiltrating from a different direction, dug out the base plates, and exfiltrated back to Benapole around first light. This was among the most daring operations deep inside enemy territory by the 18 BSF Battalion.

The Petrapol Company of 18 BSF Battalion was instrumental in providing security to many top Bangladeshi freedom movement leaders, including the Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmad, Acting President Nazrul Islam, and the military Commander-in-Chief Lt. Col. MAG Osmani, during their meetings/briefings at the Benapole ICP where the Bangladesh flag was flying with its safety and security ensured by 18 BSF Battalion. It was ensured that the Bangladeshi flag would keep flying high till the end of the liberation war. In addition, many Indian media personnel and international journalists frequently visited this place.

On the nights of 23-24 April and 8-10 May 1971, the Pakistan Army attacked Benapole from the North (Kagajpukur side). Captain Manohar Rathore was among the few Indian officers who fought alongside the Mukti Bahini as a muktijoddha, dressed in a lungi and shirt during the attack, and did not allow the enemy to cause any damage to the Bangladeshi Flag.

In addition, Major Hafiz also narrated the incident involving Lieutenant Colonel Megh Singh and how he replied to the Eastern Army Commander during his many visits to Benapole when he wanted the 1st EBR to withdraw and reorganize itself and train for future operations. As claimed by Major Hafiz, Lieutenant Colonel Megh Singh told the Army Commander, ""Sir, I have given my word of honor to my Bangladeshi friends (Dr. Tawfiq Elahi, Major Hafiz, and Mahbub Uddin were all there) that the Bangladeshi Flag will keep flying high at Benapole and it will only come down over my dead body.""

In addition, personnel from the 18 BSF Battalion also conducted many daring raids against the Pakistan Army to capture their weapons and inflict casualties, dressed as Mukti Bahini in lungi and shirt or Punjabi suit, in areas along the Rd Benapole-Navaron-Jhikargacha-Jashore to provide depth and security to the ICP throughout the nine months of the liberation war.

Capt. Manohar of the 18 BSF Battalion became the custodian of the money collected by this author and Dr. Tawfiq Elahi, SDO for more than a month before it was eventually handed over to the Government of Bangladesh. The keys had been kept with Maj Usman Chaudhary, the Sector Commander of Bangladesh forces, and the room was under the safe protection of the Petrapol Company of the 18 BSF Battalion. All of this was possible due to the dynamic leadership of Lt. Col. Megh Singh, who was willing to contribute as much as possible to the Freedom Fighters of Bangladesh in their liberation war effort.

18 BSF Battalion later moved out from Benapole when the Indian offensive commenced in December 1971 to the Western borders and were airlifted to Jaisalmer. Capt. Manohar was awarded the highest Gallantry Award given to the Paramilitary Forces called the President's Police Medal for Gallantry in 1972 for his actions in the Eastern Sector which had resulted in the elimination of 40-50 Pakistan Army personnel in the nine-month long deployment at Petrapol-Benapole ICP area during the Liberation war. The 18 BSF Battalion was deployed in Petrapol on 28 March 1971 and remained closely associated with all the activities that happened west of Jashore during the nine-month long liberation war.

I urge the Government of Bangladesh to recognize the gallant acts of the members of the 18 BSF Battalion. They made immense contribution at the grassroots level by providing safe conduct for the swearing-in ceremony of the 1st Independent Government of Bangladesh in Mujibnagar. Their efforts in protecting the Bangladesh Flag over nine months during the liberation war at Benapole-Petrapol ICP are exemplary. Their custody of the money collected by Dr. Tawfiq and Mahbub Uddin Ahmed for 40 days contributed towards the liberation war effort in a great way. They also particated in the liberation war by conducting raids and attacks deep inside Pakistani-held territory along with the 1st EBR troops led by Maj. Hafiz.

Mahbub Uddin Ahmed Bir Bikram was in charge of presenting the guard of honour to the acting president of the government-in-exile, Syed Nazrul Islam, at the oath-taking ceremony on April 17, 1971.",2023-04-16 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/focus/news/honouring-mujibnagar-heroes-3298761,2023-05-18 10:33:12,thedailystar
696,Honouring André Malraux’s Legacy,"A Look Back at His Visit to Bangladesh

During the middle of the past century, two Frenchmen were known and admired around the world. They were General de Gaulle and André Malraux.

Malraux became a celebrity in the 1930s as a writer, adventurer, and orientalist. He was also a freedom fighter who fought for the liberation of Spain and France and advocated for most non-self-governing territories. We, the students in France during the 1960s, had great admiration for him.

In 1971, the first diplomatic mission for Arab countries was formed with Mollah Jalal, an MNA, and me. But before leaving Delhi, I had the chance to suggest several Frenchmen's names for the Bangladesh conference, including his name. However, in September, Malraux made a declaration that he would not join the conference.

It was in April 1973 that André Malraux (1901-1976), France's most legendary living figure in the domain of arts and letters, politics, and philosophy, came to Bangladesh for a short visit. Since his early youth, Malraux traveled around the four corners of the world, but the four days he spent here just 50 years ago were indeed an extraordinarily memorable voyage for him as well as for the country he visited. Why? Because he responded to the hearty invitation of people who had just founded the country which did not 'exist before' but in whose existence Malraux trusted miraculously. As a matter of fact, he wanted to fight for this country with a fragile body at the age of 70. He could not forget that he had earlier fought for Spain and France and remained all along a vigilant witness of decolonization. Once he wrote, ""Nothing is more important, in the history of the world, than to be on the side of the people who had been capable of saying 'No'."" The people of Bangladesh dared to say 'No' to the oppressors and usurpers of their sovereignty. But for this, they had to pay too much in the form of misery, and death.

On 18th September 1971, Malraux made a declaration to the media that instantly became a world event. He said that he would not participate in the conference called to support Bangladesh in Delhi. Rather, he would come to fight in a company of tanks as he had some experience in it, provided the governments of Bangladesh and India permit him. He also wrote a letter to the American President: ""When the most powerful army of the world could not destroy the barefooted people of Vietnam, then how do you think that from a distance of twelve hundred miles, the army of Islamabad could get back a country desperate to achieve its independence?"" (Le Figaro. 17th Dec. 1971)

By mid-December, the fate of the war was decided in favour of Bangladesh. Even before things got totally settled, the intellectuals of the newly born nation wanted to greet this distant friend, and Malraux received an invitation from Prime Minister Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

On 21st April, Malraux, accompanied by Madame Sophie de Vilmorin, his last companion, Mr. Garofalo, photographer of the Paris-Match and two journalists of the French television, alighted at the old airport of Tejgaon. Foreign Minister Dr. Kamal Hossain with Mr. Arshad Uzzaman, the chief of protocol on the one hand and two renowned members of Bangladesh intelligentsia, Begum Sufia Kamal, poet and social worker, and Prof. Syed Ali Ahsan, Vice-Chancellor of Jahangirnagar University, waited on him.

Indira Gandhi appeared alongside André Malraux at a press conference held at the Embassy of India in Paris in the Autumn of 1971.

After a colourful reception while he advanced amidst the lined-up school children who cried 'Vive Malraux' in lieu of the usual words of slogans 'Joy' or 'Zindabad'. Malraux lifted a boy from the ground and said, ""As I cannot embrace everyone, so by doing this on this lone face, I wish to kiss Bangladesh"". Instantly, he was taken to the Presidential Palace, where he was to stay during his visit and to meet the Prime Minister, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. When asked what he might expect from Monsieur Malraux, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman replied: ""All that I want is the love, the affection and the respect that one should offer to my people. Have not you seen my beautiful people, my magnificent country, and my green fields?""

After the brief meeting, Malraux was brought to the Dhaka University campus, where he had an exclusive meeting with the Deans and senior teachers. Dr. Abdul Matin Chowdhury, the Vice Chancellor, offered him tea with 'poneer'- the Bengali cheese, which he seemed to have relished but did not forget to tell his host that there are 236 varieties of cheese in his country. Then, on arrival at the Teacher-Students' Center, he was offered by the Vice Chancellor a silver boat, a symbol of the riverside of Bangladesh, as a token of love. Malraux made a very emotional speech while addressing the students: ""For the first time, I speak in this University where there are more dead than living. Students of France know that your teachers and your friends embraced death for liberty, and they know that nowhere else ever before, students and teachers paid such a heavy price for liberty. They also know that among so many of the students who fought, there is one place where the students would rightfully tell those who would come later: 'We have fought with our bare hands' ... Your dead have rendezvous with the fate of Bangladesh, but now it is up to you to make the nation.""

Then after the official luncheon offered by the Prime Minister, Malraux was taken to visit the National Mausoleum at Savar. He placed a wreath while the army bugle was being played. Suddenly there was a brief but torrential rain, and the former freedom fighter entered the hospital for war victims. As everyone there knew who the visitor was, he was profusely garlanded, but Malraux took a garland from his neck and put it on a young man who had lost one hand and one leg. He also visited the monument for the martyrs of the 21st February Language Movement and placed a wreath there. In the evening, there was a grand reception for him at the Alliance Francaise de Dacca. Malraux made a speech by highlighting the nobility of French culture that showed the world courage, justice, and thought for action.

At 7:30 P.M., a sumptuous dinner was offered by the President of Bangladesh, in which artists, intellectuals, and political personalities took part. No formal speech was delivered in the course of the discussion. Malraux opined that he knew that Bengali literature had a rich tradition, but he had only read Tagore. About Kazi Nazrul Islam, the National Poet of Bangladesh, he could learn while traveling from Delhi to Dhaka and was attracted by his personality. An interesting cultural show was presented to end up the first day's programs.

On September 19, 1971, Paris Jour featured a declaration made by Malraux, in which he conveyed his intention to participate in the Bangladesh Liberation War.

The following day was also a very special day as André Malraux was going to be awarded a doctorate Honoris Causa in a special Convocation at the University of Rajshahi. After two salutatory addresses by Vice-Chancellor Dr. Khan Sarwar Morshed and Justice Abu Sayeed Chowdhury, the President of Bangladesh, André Malraux accepted the honor with a passionate speech.

Following the famous inscription of antiquity to honor them, Malraux advised, ""On any of the graveyards of your freedom fighters, in the ditches filled with the dead bodies of your intellectuals, write in large letters: You, who shall pass later on, go tell all of ours that those who fell here were dead because during the nine months of suffering they accepted to fight with bare hands. Salute the dead of the surrounding forest! You have shown the world that one can never assassinate enough to kill the soul of a person who would not surrender.

""On the roads of the Orient, there are tombs of French knights; on all the roads of the Occident, there are tombs of the soldiers of WWII... And on your tombs, there are perhaps memories of the words of justice and of liberty with which the generals of the Revolution had set Europe on fire. Your culture holds to you in one lone and big word: Spirituality. Your liberation has attempted to unite the language of eternal Bengal with that of our Revolution.""

After lunch at the Vice-Chancellor's residence, Malraux visited Varendra Research Museum in the town, three miles away from the campus. This was an extraordinary scene as he seemed to be in his own world with all the statues and the icons around, and he started a very elaborate explanation of the significance of their existence to Madame Sophie de Vilmorin in particular.

Returning to Dhaka, a quiet lunch with the President and his family took place at Bangabhaban. Justice Chowdhury and Malraux discussed the problems of family planning, as well as of China. In the afternoon, he visited the National Museum at Neemtoli (the old site) and then came to the Art College (now the Institute of Fine Arts of the University of Dhaka), where he discussed with the students and teachers. There was also an exhibition of paintings which he watched with care. Then he joined a small cocktail party in the hotel suite of the French Ambassador to celebrate the Easter festival. A sumptuous dinner followed by a musical soiree was arranged at the Foreign Minister's residence. Malraux seemed to have liked the Bengali songs with revolutionary themes and rhythm. He even asked to repeat a song twice.

The third day's visit was at Chittagong, where a festive reception was accorded at the airport. Then Malraux was taken to see the dilapidated war-torn port. A grand civic reception was held at the Chittagong Club. He was presented with an old manuscript, considered the most precious gift to be offered. His speech was very much appreciated, but it was the same as that of Rajshahi, with two excerpts, one in the beginning and one in the conclusion, where he lauded the role of Chittagong for her special contribution to the war of liberation. He reminded that an extraordinary effort of the people was needed to reconstruct the country, in which he would initiate the program of aid as an advisor to the Government of France.

As the ceremony was over, a grand lunch was awaited in the house of Mr. A. K. Khan, industrialist and a former minister. It was indeed an international festival there. Malraux enjoyed it very much and had an exchange of ideas with many. He also made his admirers happy by giving autographs according to their demand, and as per the advice of the ambassador of France, he had an exclusive discussion session on the economic situation of Bangladesh with his host for fifty minutes, along with the present writer as interpreter.

There were two more programs for the afternoon. A quick visit to the Alliance Française de Chittagong. There he liked the 'dab' (green coconut) water with ice cubes on a silver plate. Mr. Juned Chowdhury offered him a copy of the Etude sur l'évolution intellectuelle chez les musulmans du Bengale 1857–1947, which was written by his interpreter (Mahmud Shah Qureshi) who was also the President of Alliance in those years.

Malraux also had a look at the painting exhibition of the teachers and students of the University of Chittagong there. Then he rushed to inaugurate Chittagong Art Gallery and Folk Museum at Mehdibag, where another exhibition was installed. He was offered a painting of Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin, which he accepted with great admiration and respect. In a short speech, Malraux called upon the artists to draw scenes of the local culture on their canvas. He was also moved by the gift of a painting from young Nayak, son of artist Sabih-ul Alam.

André Malraux in Dhaka, 1973.

Then by helicopter, he was flown to Kaptai, where the houseboat of M.A.K. Khan was ready to show him the beauty of the lake in the middle of Chittagong Hill Tracts. Madame Sophie de Vilmorin, his companion, enjoyed it to the fullest, as she described vividly in her book 'Aimer Encore'. There was another surprise from a few sampan-loaded people who cried ""Vive Malraux"" (Long live Malraux). The present writer got some exclusive minutes from one of the most famous intellectuals in the world to answer his questions. In the Kaptai Guest House, Malraux left his suit and his tie. He wore a red shirt and enjoyed his dinner with Ruhi fish of the lake.

The next morning he reached Dhaka and faced a very energetic press conference. He insisted on more foreign help for Bangladesh as the actual loss of the country was unaccountable. He also lauded the role of the freedom fighters in liberating the country.

Before leaving Dhaka on a plane at 12.25 pm, he met the President and the Prime Minister. But he also got time to write his best wishes in two books as a gift to his interpreters. From Paris, he wrote an extraordinary letter on May 8, 1973 to this author.

""My dear Professor,

On return to Paris (with the book which you have so kindly presented me), I wish to tell you about the friendly memory that I conserve to our collaboration. You have helped me much, and without you, my relationship with my listeners in Chittagong would not have been what it was. The intelligence, the rapidity, and the tonality of your translations established a communication and sometimes a communion for which I am grateful to you. Let us hope that we can now put into realizing what we have undertaken for your country, which has become a little mine, and trust, my dear professor, to my sympathetic memory.""

Here is not the end of the story. Shortly after his return to Paris, he appeared before the court to save the young man who wanted to hijack a plane for sending medicine to Bangladesh. I also met him after four months in his residence. He told me that he had done what he promised. He talked to the Education Minister of France not to disturb the teaching of Bengali as it was apprehended and to the Chinese Ambassador in favour of the recognition of Bangladesh to be a member of the United Nations. And needless to say that France would continue to help Bangladesh in a massive way, at least as was expected by the optimist humanist André Malraux.

697,The Partition of India,"A unique feature of Indian history is that over thousands of years people of different nationalities had entered India in large numbers. This has not happened anywhere else. These outsiders had attacked India and looted valuables, but they did not return to their home country. They continued to live in India. But there were only three exceptions — Alexander of Greece, Mahmud of Ghazni and Nadir Shah from Iran. Despite a few exceptions, however, it can be said that these foreign attackers did not come with the intention of looting and returning to their countries. They came from Central Asia and other regions to settle permanently in India and remained here in large numbers. In ancient times, the Aryans attacked India and settled here. These outsiders subsequently played a significant role in molding the culture and civilization of India. One cannot conceive Hindu religion and culture without the Aryans. After the Aryans, the Sakas, Huns, Turkish, Pathans and Moghuls came and stayed back in India.

After the discovery of North and South America, Europeans went forth to conquer those countries and began to live there too. But that situation was very different from outsiders who came to attack India and settled here. The Europeans killed numerous Native Americans, threatening to make them extinct and trapping them in forced isolation. They could not contribute in any way to the governance or culture of the New World. The Aryans destroyed the Mohenjo-daro and Harappa civilizations that were far superior to their own. The Aryans were involved mainly in animal husbandry, and their culture mingled with the culture of ancient India. This blend resulted in the Aryan culture transforming Indian culture. In a way, it can be said that Aryan culture had made pre-Aryan Indian culture its own in many ways. What is known as Indian Hindu culture today was actually influenced by the foreign Aryans.

After the Aryans, the Sakas, Huns, Arabs, Iranians, Turkish, Pathans and Mughals attacked and conquered India and settled in this land. In Rabindranath's words, they had all merged into one body. These outsiders did not look at the Indians as enemies and did not try to disassociate from them. Rather, they sought to be at one with the Indians and strengthen their own position in this land. They did not try to create divisions, but tried to maintain unity for their own safety and well-being.

The Arabs, Turkish, Pathans and Mughals who came and ruled over India were different from former conquerors in one significant way. They stayed in India and adopted Indian customs, but did not forego their religion like those who had entered India before them. These peoples were followers of Islam and maintained their religious beliefs. However, though Islam and Hinduism remained independent of each other, they influenced each other. This was most strongly evident in the spheres of culture.

Though belonging to a separate religious belief, the Muslim rulers strove to maintain cordial relations between Hindus and Muslims as a way of fortifying their reign. This strategy was pursued throughout the reigns of the Sultans and the Mughals and the Pathans. Alauddin Khilji and later Akbar distanced themselves from fervent religiosity and tried to unite the Hindus and the Muslims. Even Aurangzeb, who was anti-Hindu and razed some Hindu temples, gave financial aid to many Hindu temples and recruited Hindus to administrative posts and also in his army. Aurangzeb never tried to create a rift between the Muslims and the Hindus. This policy was in place until the end of the Mughal rule.

Since the seventeenth century when European trade began to expand, European traders started coming to India, especially to regions around the Pacific Ocean for business purposes. By the eighteenth century, they had established their strong presence in India. Among them, the English traders were in the majority and to facilitate their commerce, they employed defense troops in southern and eastern parts of India. This need for a security force was also triggered by the competition and hostility among the European countries. The English and French were at the forefront of these measures.

In the second half of the eighteenth century, the English fortified their security in Bengal and Madras and continued to expand their business interests. In the process, they collided with the ruling Nawabs of Bengal and their relations deteriorated. There were armed clashes and eventually, the English defeated the independent ruling Nawab, and put subservient Nawabs in position who would do their biddings. This resulted in the East India Company taking administrative control in Bengal, and later in some other regions. This control remained steady until the 1857 sepoy mutiny. After the mutiny, the government of England disbanded the company's rule and directly began to rule India.

The outsiders who had attacked India before the British had come with the intention of settling here and had done so. But the Europeans had come to India with a different purpose. They had come for commercial profiteering. When the British usurped power in Bengal, it was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in England. Soon, Bengal and other regions of India became a market for the manufactured goods of England. Thus began widespread plundering, which resulted in enormous financial gains that made a great contribution to the industrial growth and prosperity of England.

After grabbing power in Bengal in 1757, the British went about administrative reforms within their jurisdiction. They initiated land reform and established a new, permanent structure. This new system not only affected the economy but had far-reaching consequences in the social and political spheres of the region. In the nineteenth century, a new middle class came into being under this system. Later, becoming more influential, they played a vital role in defining the politics of Bengal and other regions. For purposes of administration, the British modernized the education system. Until 1835, Persian was the administrative language, but by the early nineteenth century, more importance was being given to the study of the English language.

During the reign of the East India Company, Hindus took full advantage of all facilities such as education and other offerings. Muslims, on the other hand, believed that the rule of the Mughals was their own, and the British were an alien force. They were not inclined to accept the opportunities created by the British, not even the chance to learn the English language. Before the British took power, many elite Muslims and others held senior positions in the administration and the army. These jobs became the basis of class divisions. The elimination of these jobs, along with the fact that even during the Mughal and Nawabi periods, they could not acquire the status of a landowner or zamindar, threw these Muslims into a financial crisis. Poverty entered the lives of thousands. Their circumstances became dire because they had refused to learn the English language and avail other opportunities offered by the British. They remained far behind the Hindus in education and in socio-political and economic status.

After the sepoy mutiny of 1857, the Muslims realized that they had made a big blunder by not availing themselves of the resources offered by the British and were thus lagging behind for a hundred years. Now they took the initiative to rectify that mistake. By this time, the rule of the East India Company was over, and the British monarchy was now ruling directly. The issue of improving education for the Muslims was given attention, and some other benefits were also extended to them. Some job opportunities were also provided for the Muslims.

Until then, the Hindus had absolute access to all the services offered by the British authorities. Now that the Muslims had entered the game, they became competitors. The Hindus began to feel that part of what was originally theirs was now being given to the Muslims; they were being forced to enter into a competition and were deprived of their monopoly.

Thus, in the second half of the nineteenth century, a conflict arose between the Hindus and the Muslims. This was the beginning of Hindu nationalism. In the eighteen sixties, under the leadership of Nabagopal Mitra and Rajnarayan Basu, an assembly was arranged where it was proclaimed that the Hindus were a separate nation. This announcement of nationhood was given with the purpose of creating a division between the Hindus and the Muslims. Later Bankim Chandra became a strong spokesman of this nationhood. At that time, Abdul Latif and Syed Ameer Ali in Bengal and Sir Syed Ahmed in Uttar Pradesh emerged as leaders of the Muslim community. They initiated various efforts for the development of Muslims and even lobbied with the British government for additional resources. However, they never presented Muslims as a separate nation or made an announcement to that effect. It was not until 1940 when Muslim League's Lahore Resolution was passed that the concept of a separate nationhood for Muslims came into being.

In the nineteenth century, the word 'communalism' was not in vogue. In the twentieth century, the British were the first to call the Hindu-Muslim conflict as 'communalism.' But even without the idea of communalism, the competition between the Hindus and the Muslims in the latter half of the nineteenth century had sown the seed of communalism. Later in the early twentieth century, this discord and unpleasant competition triggered a hostility that had a powerful effect on the political situation in the thirties and forties. Not only that, but it became a decisive factor in the turn of events.

The British government had deliberately contrived to create this situation. When, after the sepoy mutiny in 1857, they offered educational facilities and other opportunities for Muslims, their main purpose was to create tensions and make Hindus and Muslims fellow-contenders and engage in bitterness. They adopted this policy of creating divisiveness in order to secure their own power and ensure a smooth reign for themselves. They also began to influence the study of history. Renowned scholar and historian James Mill in his famous book, The History of British India, traced the history of India in three periods— Hindu, Muslim and British. He named the first two periods on the basis of religion, but did not refer to the third period as Christian, rather he called it British. Never before had the pre-British historical periods been referred to on the basis of religions. By doing this, James Mill, an imperialist historian, had pioneered the concept of communalism and laid the foundation for its growth in the future. He was indeed successful in doing this. During the British reign, the history that Indians studied was molded on the ideas propagated by James Mill and this helped to further disseminate the notion of communalism.

The difference in the status of Hindus and Muslims in the nineteenth century triggered a crisis in the politics of the twentieth century. That is why it is impossible to understand the politics of the twentieth century without a thorough discussion and deliberation about the situation in the nineteenth century. The strife between Hindus and Muslims vying for secure jobs that occurred in the nineteenth century had escalated in the twentieth century to contest and contention among capitalists seeking power. The consequence of this was the partition of India.

With the growth of capitalism, the interests of different capitalist countries collided. This collision created warlike hostilities and led to war. England and France engaged in war for a very long time. The first and second world wars were fought among different capitalist countries. But within one country the different components of capitalism did not cause any friction. In India, however, the capital of Hindus and Muslims became divided. There was an unhealthy contention and discord between them. As a result of this, the battle of capital took the shape of communal riots. Different countries were fighting wars, but within India communal riots took place. The role of communal riots in the politics of India was an important one.

The independence movement in India was delayed. Before 1927, the political parties did not ask for independence. When the movement did start, it did not identify the British as enemies and did not proceed to castigate them. The movement was to put pressure on the British to hand over the reins of the government to the Indians. Their strategy was to request and seek approval from the British. Maulana Mohammad Ali called this a 'Begging and Praying Politics.'

There was no unity in the Indian struggle for independence. Since the thirties a divisiveness formed. As a result, the level of Hindu-Muslim hostility was far greater than the opposition towards the British. This animosity, in fact, led to the partition of India. Hindu, Muslim, Congress, League all contributed to the break-up of India.

Because the independence movement was meant to put pressure and leaned towards compromise, neither the Congress nor the Muslim League harbored strong aversions towards the British. ""Movement"" and discussions about compromise went hand-in-hand as the independence movement progressed. To avoid direct confrontation, Gandhi promoted non-violence, which became the mainstay of their politics. The Muslim League also did not have any hostility or armed conflict with the British. In the 1940s, they chanted the slogan ""We will fight to win Pakistan,"" but their fight was not against the British, but against the Congress and the Hindus.

It is to be noted that Gandhi's non-violence was applicable only to Indians. The basic tenet of this philosophy of non-violence was that Indians should not engage in any violence during their independence movement, but there was no mention of violence committed by the British. Gandhi was against people's violence in Chauri Chaura, but he was completely silent about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and his lack of protest drew a negative reaction even from Rabindranath Tagore. Gandhi also criticized the Indian forces who, in demonstrating their patriotic protest to the British, refused to shoot at the public in the Qissa Khwani Bazaar in Peshawar. Gandhi was against the actions of Bhagat Singh, and when the British hanged him, Gandhi did not raise his voice and remained mute.

The independence movement against British was mainly constitutional. Both Jinnah and Gandhi, because of their class, wanted to limit the movement within the framework of the parliament. In fact, Muslim League was never engaged in any active opposition or agitation against the ruling power. Under Gandhi's leadership, the Congress would lead a non-violent movement and try to keep it within the framework of the constitution. If ever the situation became violent or threatened to become so, Gandhi would intervene and stop its escalation.

During the independence movement, the Congress and Muslim League constantly kept in touch with the ruling British authorities in India and held discussions with them. These discussions played a guiding role in the forties. Arrangements for the transfer of power ultimately took place after talks with the Viceroy, the dialogue at the Shimla convention, and discussions with Cabinet Mission, and with Mountbatten.

In the forties, the Congress-League independence movement focused predominantly on the division of power and apportioning shares. In 1944, the long talks between Jinnah and Gandhi that lasted for several days and ended without any agreement could only be called a scandalous affair. The independence movement did not focus on the actual enemy, the British government in India. The way this movement emphasized the Congress-League relations was very different from freedom movements in other countries and can be called a rare and exceptional event.

In this conflict of dividing and sharing, the main enemy, the British government, played the role of a mediator. The ruling British, the Congress, and Muslim League sat at one table and finalized discussions about the handing over of power. This was a conspiracy against the people of India. They pulled the wool over the eyes of the people and betrayed them as they partitioned India.

The Hindu-Muslim or Congress-League antagonism would not have resulted in the partition, nor would there be communal riots and clashes and deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people if the freedom struggle had been allowed to follow its own course and the policy of non-violence had not been adopted. Gandhi announced and followed his philosophy of non-violence, and Jinnah with his silent support of non-violence did not allow the freedom struggle against the British to gain momentum. Thus, the passion and turbulence created did not target the British but actually victimized the Indians. Its extreme form was revealed in communal riots and their atrocities.

In any movement, struggle, or war, it is crucial to recognize the real enemy. The independence of India was not possible without the abolition of British rule in India, but the politicians of India did not pinpoint this truth as they progressed. They did not view the British as an enemy, rather sought to make compromises with them, and it was this perspective that led to the events that followed. In the thirties and again in the forties, instead of zeroing in on the British as their prime enemy, the Hindus and Muslims became each other's foes, and the Congress and Muslim League were at loggerheads. Because of the efficacy of their diplomats in this situation, the British evolved from being an enemy to becoming a mediator.

Even the communists did not stand up against the British; rather, within the framework of constitutional politics, they made efforts to unify the Congress and Muslim League and asked them to resolve their differences. In 1944, when the Gandhi-Jinnah talks ended in futility, the Communist leader P.C. Joshi wrote his book titled They Shall Meet Again. The communists did not fight for independence on their own but chose to remain within the orbit of Congress and League.

Due to the exploitation and oppression of the British, the general public had started to feel a resentment and resistance that grew into a vital force. But because of the ineffective movement, the British never became the prime target of the struggle. There was no consolidated or unified struggle; only the seeds of divisiveness were sown into it.

The middle class that actively took part in the independence movement and provided leadership was the product of the land reforms and job opportunities given by the British. Another important factor was that the capitalists who influenced the Congress and League had reached that position after being patronized by the British and continued to be dependent on their goodwill. They maintained a compromising relationship with the imperialists. Stalin, in 1925, had commented that India's local capital had surrendered to the imperial capital. Because of these class distinctions, those who played a vital role in the Indian struggle for freedom were spineless and deferential.

Those who led the Indian independence movement did not actually represent the masses. They represented landowners, zamindars and capitalists. The far-reaching ambit and command of Birla over Gandhi, Nehru and Patel was not hidden from anyone. In submission to the demand and interests of Birla, Tata, et al, Congress divided India and Bengal. Jinnah liked landowning nawabs, knights, the Adamjees and Ispahanis. The Muslim League represented the weaker sections of Muslim landowners, zamindars, and capitalists and demanded Pakistan for them.

India's compromising political leadership, unlike the leadership in China's war of freedom, did not allow the freedom struggle in India to follow its own pace and reach its potential. A turbulent and persistent resistance against an enemy creates its own solidarity. Otherwise, grounds for differences emerge to the fore. This is what happened in India. The Congress and Muslim League negotiated and compromised with the British, remained within the parliamentarian framework, and launched their so-called independence movement. This led to the growth of communalism and gave the British the scope and opportunity to devise the handover of power according to their own terms and conditions. The division of India and Bengal was the inevitable consequence.

698,The Liberation War Museum narrating collective trauma,"Liberation War Museum (LWM) in Dhaka tells the story not only of the Liberation War but also of the long struggles of breaking the fetters that, over the decades, led to the ultimate formation of Bangladesh. For a nation that went through as many major tragedies as Bangladesh, this is not merely a museum meant for education or recreation but a site of personally meaningful memory for millions. The interpretation of history in the museum is from a Bengali Bangladeshi perspective and the narrative is largely that of the victims and sufferers chronicling their own histories. The exhibition of the collections is geared towards visitors who are mostly locals and might often have a personal link to the war, and for whom, the viewing might aid in the process of healing. There is a deeply ethical element to the museum collections, and, for a visitor who has links to the perpetrators of violence, the collections may inspire a sense of guilt or the desire to undo historical injustices. And even for others who do not have a personal connection to the war, the museum has the potential to be one of the most emotionally perturbing sites of memory they ever visit.

Madhusudan Dey, affectionately referred to as Madhu da, is commemorated in the Liberation War Museum with a shirt donated by his family members.

Every museum has a specific social, ethical, and perhaps also a political purpose, and every museum has a story to tell. The story that LWM narrates is one of national suffering that led to the establishment of today's modern Bangladesh. It is a narrative that finds echoes in many of the larger social and political discourses of the country. What is interesting is the ways in which LWM attempts to navigate the challenges of narrating a kind of collective trauma that has been and continues to be narrated extensively and in varied, often contradictory, ways in the larger society.

In the face of increasing number of official apologies and transitional justice movements, memorial museums like LWM have emerged all over the world. Such a museum becomes all the more important for Bangladesh in the absence of any restitution, formal compensation or apology to war victims from Pakistan's end. Museums play a central role in the mediation of memory in the public realm. This becomes even more significant considering that, in Bangladesh, for a long stretch of time, the military achievements of the war became the focus of attention and the civil agitation behind the war lay buried under layers of dust.

LWM presents itself as a storehouse of the memories of ordinary people as well as freedom fighters. Founded in 1996 in the backdrop of civil society agitations for war crimes trials, and at a time when there finally was adequate space for commemorating civilian contribution in the war, LWM memorialises objects donated by victims' families and survivors of the war, in the form of photographs, daily use objects and family heirlooms. Many of the exhibits are mundane objects but they each tell a memory story, often a deeply distressing one. For instance, the museum displays burnt wood pieces from Khan-house of Keraniganj near Dhaka, which, the visitor learns, was set on fire by the Pakistani army on November 25, 1971. Another display holds a two anna coin donated by Md. Zillur Rahman Jamil, and the note beside it informs us that this coin was paid to a young boy by a Pakistani soldier in exchange for a can of milk inside what seems to have been one of the army rape camps. The boy, we are told, never spent the coin as he could not get that scene out of his mind.

The museum website has an open call to people to donate objects of relevance to the museum. For a museum that aims to tell the story of people's sufferings, crowdsourcing of objects seems to be a befitting approach. With the name of the donors mentioned beside every exhibit, visitors get an impression of interacting with survivors and victims' families instead of museum curators. Such participatory culture fits in with the aim of creating a sense of citizenship through shared suffering, and, in some ways, breaks down the walls of elitism around museums.

As mentioned in the mission statement of the museum, it aims to commemorate not only the suffering but also the heroism of the people, which, together, generates the discourse of martyrdom. The discourse of martyrdom in any culture is fraught with many complexities and can be interrogated at great length. Leaving that aside for another time, one might shift attention to how the museum exhibits offer an entry-point into this discourse through material memory. The galleries are designed in such a manner that there is an impression of allocation of similar space to all martyrs' contributions as the museum exhibits similar objects like monochrome photos and clothes for all victims, whether they be civilian, military participants or those who accidentally came under the wheels of history. This humanises the dead, personalises history and emphasises the individuality of each victim instead of them being reduced to statistical data.

The differing social status and professions of various martyrs is also made evident through the various objects displayed. There are social and vocational clues in the memorabilia. For instance, the museum displays the art works of Bhupatinath Chakraborty Chowdhury, a mentor of music and art. His artwork is accompanied by a narrative of him being compelled to perform during his interrogation by the Pakistani army. Not only material memories of those who died but also those of individuals who contributed in their own ways towards the war efforts are exhibited in the galleries. For example, the museum preserves a radio receiver used by Ejaz Hussain to monitor news broadcasts from which information was later used for Swadhin Bangla Betar. This serves the museum's purpose of illustrating the contribution of the entire population towards the liberation of the nation. The narrative comes across as one in which everyone is united, putting aside differences in class and social backgrounds. The exhibits are doubtless filtered and mediated through the museum curators, but the crowdsourcing of memorabilia visibly adds an element of egalitarianism to the display. In a way, the museum, like the formation of Bangladesh, is also presented as an outcome of its citizens' efforts.

What LWM offers is a very physical and dramatic experience of the war. Using various media, through effective lighting, architecture and accompanying narratives, it appeals to the visitor's sensory faculties. This contributes not only to the visitor experience but also adds to the meaning of the site. For instance, one of the galleries includes a dark room with dimmed lighting in which the displays are behind wired nets, and an army truck glares at visitors with its headlights on. On several occasions, I observed visitors, including chattering school students on a day trip, being stunned to silence at the sight of the army truck. Even if they were visiting casually, the very tactile experience brings in an awareness that they are engaging with intensely traumatic memory in some form, even if not in the form of conscious critical engagement. Another gallery has an entire wall covered with poignant photos from wartime refugee shelters in Kolkata in which entire families lived inside concrete sewage pipes. What makes the viewing experience even more intense are similar pipes projecting out of the gallery walls. Even though some of the exhibits may be small objects which may seem minor and inconsequential in terms of their economic value, like the coin donated by Md. Zillur Rahman Jamil, but they serve to tell deep affective stories.

The museum was located in a residential building in Segunbagicha since its foundation in 1996 but has now shifted to Agergaon in 2017. Earlier, insufficiency of space necessitated that only 1300 objects could be displayed. How does the physical experience of visiting LWM change now that it has moved to a spacious modern building with twenty-first century architecture and advanced technologies? The knowledge and the space enter into a combination with each other to create the physical and emotional response to the museum and its collections. Is the modern building, with its elevators and its glass doors, representative of a new modern Bangladesh that is built on the foundation of its past traumatic sufferings? Is it emblematic of a Bangladesh that is moving ahead with times despite its foundational trauma?

LWM provides a very hybrid space with multimedia engagements where there are photographs, material objects, audios, and videos. Many of the documents in the archives have been digitised and made accessible to a wider audience and international researchers. The museum website also offers access to a virtual tour in which viewers can navigate through various galleries and listen to audio descriptions of artefacts. It also has a mobile form in which a bus goes around the country disseminating information about the war. In addition, there is active engagement through the various social media pages of the museum. For instance, LWM's Facebook page publishes a 'This day of the year' post every day in which it mentions significant events that happened on each day of 1971. This intense memorialisation through Facebook not only keeps up with digital trends but also facilitates audience experience, contributes to memorialisation and creates meaning in a complex way.

In today's mediatised environment and rapidly changing technological field, the museum is no longer merely a one-time experience, but it instead offers an opportunity to connect via online platforms. It is not just the physical space of the museum anymore, but the museum's activities can be accessed through multiple media platforms, thereby allowing viewers to have varied entry points into the museum's narrative. The museum space is transcended both physically through mobile museums and virtually through online access. Such uses of modern digitisation technologies shows that LWM is evolving with times and adapting to the shifting landscape of modern communication with sophisticated new technologies. One of the main struggles of LWM is to get 1971 internationally recognised as a genocide. Thus, the digital outreach programme, digital reproduction and exhibition might serve a significant role in reaching a wider audience and increasing engagement.

Digital media has become commonplace in museums, not only in the West but also in South Asia. Thus, my intention is not to marvel at the novelty of digitisation in LWM but to open questions about the target viewership of the museum and the societal changes that bring about this need for newness in museological practice. The social media presence and virtual viewing options are not neutral and inconsequential. What are the societal needs that these changes cater to? Is it that the humdrum of our social media life has encroached upon museums? Are museums succumbing to the unquestioned technophilia around us? Or is it that the museums are transcending beyond the space that they have traditionally been limited to? In a nation like Bangladesh where digital literacy is on the rise, LWM's investment of time and resources into digitisation is meaningful indeed.

Museums and archives have always held the power, in the Foucauldian sense, of being storehouses of knowledge. The power to disseminate knowledge of specific memory, to decide what is worthy of remembering, to determine whose archival value mandates preservation. It is interesting to see how LWM exerts its power to create an overarching narrative of the Liberation War. At the same time, it is also interesting to witness the effect that the larger social trends have on its museological practices. Using inventive technology in a museum comes with its own challenges. How to digitise collective trauma without falling into the trap of going overboard, so as not to jeopardise the reverence and contemplation that is aimed for, so as not to trivialize the gravitas of the subject? Populist practices facilitate engagement with the larger public, but it also presents a challenge for museums to not let the populist practices eclipse its larger message. It is to be seen how LWM navigates the difficult terrain of strengthening the legitimacy of its cultural status as a source of authoritative information while, at the same time, opening up the museum space to make it a more welcoming and accessible site.

699,"Writing the Good Fight: Women, War, and Jahanara Imam’s Ekattorer Dinguli","In 1938, as Hitler marched across Europe, Virginia Woolf, in Three Guineas, urged women to ""maintain an attitude of complete indifference"" to war. She took a clear position on whether or not women have a stake in politics and war. But is it possible for women to remain indifferent to war? What if the war is waged to remove the oppressive conditions of a suffering people as was the case with the Bangladeshi liberation struggle? Where is the acknowledgement of the potential for freedom, for genuine historical transformation, in modern political movements?

Women are inherently bound up with these struggles. Besides, what if a woman's family members were soldiers in such a war? Under such circumstances, it is unlikely that she would decline to take part. It is one thing for a woman to be repulsed by jingoistic military displays as Woolf was, but quite another to assume that there can be no struggle worth waging. At the receiving end of Pakistan's exploitative sub-colonial domination over its eastern wing, Jahanara Imam's situation demanded her involvement. She could not sit by while the army from West Pakistan raped, tortured, and murdered her fellow citizens. Indifference or pacifism under the conditions prevailing in the country would amount to support for the aggressors.

Jahanara Imam (1929-94), together with the rest of her family, was deeply invested in national affairs: her older son, Shafi Imam Rumi, was a freedom fighter; her husband, Shariful Imam, assisted the guerilla operations with maps and target identification; and her younger son, Saif Imam Jami, served as a lookout to ensure the safety of the freedom fighters as they entered or left the house. Imam herself conveyed information for the liberation warriors, in addition to providing nourishment, funds, necessary supplies, and protection at considerable personal risk. She recruited friends and relations to deepen and disperse support for the Mukti Bahini. Further, she endured enormous personal losses in the freedom struggle: the arrest and subsequent disappearance of her older son and the interrogation and torture of her younger son and husband, who died three days before the war ended.

Revered widely as Shaheed Janani (Mother of Martyrs), in the 1990s Imam organized the Ekattorer Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee to bring to justice war criminals and collaborators of the 1971-genocide. As the convener of this body, in 1992 she was charged with sedition by the BNP government. The following year, while addressing the public with updated findings of the Committee, she was assaulted by the police.

Compiled from daily diary entries made during the 1971 war, Imam's memoir Ekattorer Dinguli (Days of '71) presents a poignant eye-witness account of the country's nine-month freedom struggle, blending a personal narrative with the political destiny of the nation. The narrative ranges from her shock upon discovering bomb component and two large mortars and pestles (to grind them) stashed in Rumi's closet; to her realization that thousands of plain-clothed soldiers were being flown to East Pakistan and ships packed with weapons were arriving at Chittagong harbor while fruitless talks continued between political leaders Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Yahya Khan, and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto; to her agony following her decision to grant Rumi permission to join the war; to rearranging the furniture in her living room to give greater cover to guerilla freedom fighters sheltering in her home; and, finally, to the raising of the Bangladeshi flag. Reviewing the English translation of Ekattorer Dinguli, Philip Hensher writes in The Guardian, ""Just as the Holocaust needed a Diary of Anne Frank that brought the numbing total of deaths down to an individual, human case, so the Bangladeshi massacres are brought down to the feelings of a mother for her son"" (March 1, 2013).

Jahanara Imam's final resting place at the Martyred Intellectuals Graveyard in Mirpur.

Imam was a full participant in the political struggle of her day. Despite her staggering bereavements, she had a stake in the freedom movement. Her loving and maternal attachments, as powerful as she feels them, do not preclude this fact. Indeed, they nurture it. The question cannot simply be, is revolutionary struggle good or bad for women? Doubtless, insofar as the regulation of women's bodies and sexuality are concerned, nationalism has repeatedly had catastrophic consequences for women in South Asia and elsewhere, as has colonialism. But what Imam could not ignore was that, as the Bangladeshi freedom struggle developed, it opened up the prospect that social issues, including but not confined to women's issues, could be more substantively addressed.

Ekattorer Dinguli

Last night, all of us stayed up, again. Sounds of gunfire, columns of fire, smoke swirling upwards. In the morning, the sound of gunfire paused for a while… When at eight-thirty, they made a radio-announcement regarding the lifting of the curfew, Rumi and I set out in the car… When we reached the vegetable sellers' area of New Market, Rumi hit the brakes with ""Oh God""! The entire market was gutted by fire. Parts of it still smoldering. I screamed, ""Look, there are charred human bodies too…"" Rumi said, ""Amma, don't look"" and turning right on Mirpur Road, sped away…

Ekattorer Dinguli is a crucial historico-literary document of the war. It presents firsthand accounts of violence as part of an effort to organize a politics of liberation. To maintain historical accuracy, Imam fact-checked using eighty audio tapes of interviews with Rumi's surviving cohorts and other participants, especially, the details of the guerilla operations. She mentioned in later interviews that she was aware of the risks involved in keeping a journal that included details of guerilla activities and that she adopted different strategies to conceal the contents. She inserted into her daily logs irrelevant, even trivial, minutiae, giving the impression that her journal was nothing more than the ramblings of a bored housewife. She wrote in code—six sarees in place of six rifles—and concealed soldiers' identities by changing their names. Finally, she wrote forming geometrical patterns and using pens with inks of different colors to give the journal a look of triviality.

The memoir begins on March 1, 1971, when after Mujib's electoral victory Yahya Khan declared an indefinite postponement of the convening of the National Assembly, and it continues to December 17, 1971, the day after the Pakistani Army's surrender. Through its successive daily entries, it weaves details of domestic life into the contemporary political situation, with Imam's older son, Rumi, dominating the narrative. His involvement in leftist student politics, his decision to join the Mukti Bahini, his training, the actions he leads, and, finally, his capture constitute key events in Ekattorer Dinguli.

In her entry for April 21, Imam narrates granting Rumi permission to enlist in the Mukti Bahini. After rejecting his repeated appeals, reminding him that he is scheduled to start college in the United States that September, Rumi turns her refusal to let him participate in the war into a moral issue. Like many a young man before him, he states that his non-participation will forever weigh on his conscience. Eventually his mother gives in, ""I shut my eyes tightly and said, 'Alright, I concede. I sacrifice you to the country. Go, enroll in the war.'"" And, with that, the entry ends.

The sparseness of Imam's description, its matter-of-factness, evokes through its understatement the personal costs of war even as it powerfully conveys the sense of being caught up in events. The text packs its powerful emotional charge precisely through its exactness. At the time she wrote the diary, she knew that her twenty-year-old son was running a terrible risk and was afraid for the harm that might befall him. When she compiled the text for publication, she had experienced the worst. Exercising tight control over her pen, Imam conveyed her loss and, by implication, the suffering of innumerable others by euphemism, understatement, and silence.

The gravity of Imam's narrative is interspersed with moments of grim humor. One such is her encounter with a Pakistani soldier just as she prepares to send winter supplies to the freedom fighters:

Last week, as I was bargaining over six sweaters, a military-man patrolling the sidewalks approached me, ""Why are you buying so many sweaters, Ma'am? To send to the young fighters?"" I felt my heart jump to my throat, but managed a smile and replied [in Urdu] ""Yes son, didn't Begum Liaquat Ali announce in the papers to buy sweaters, towels, soaps, blades, toffee, chewing gum for our soldiers and send to the APWA office? You know what the APWA office is, don't you? The All Pakistan Women's Association …"" I stressed the ""All Pakistan"" part. Who knows what the chap understood, he simply nodded his head saying ""Yes, of course"" and left.

Unsettled by the soldier's question, Imam deftly switches to Urdu. She also manages to bring up a prominent West Pakistani figure, Ra'ana Liaquat Ali, the wife of the country's first prime minister. Cleverly re-interpreting his query, she manages to address the enemy soldier as ""son.""

***

The passionate support that the nationalist cause garnered must be viewed in conjunction with anti-colonial nationalism and the radicalism of the Bangladesh movement. It was a progressive struggle and one that could hardly be conducted nonviolently. The overwhelmingly popular leader of East Pakistan, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was frozen out of Parliament, the election results disregarded, and all attempts at negotiation scuttled. Moreover, the Pakistani army occupied the country. The struggle was democratic not only in the sense of being popular, but it also promised a substantial reordering of society. No one was immune to the main political question, millions felt they had a stake. This was true of men no more than women, who were, of course, represented in every group and class.

Further, the freedom struggle also presented a challenge to patriarchy. The nationalist movement directed its energies at removing oppressive social and cultural demands made on the Bengali population by the Pakistani state. For instance, aiming to establish a ""national identity"" between the culturally different populations of the eastern and western wings of Pakistan, the state insisted on reforming Bengali women's dress. On the resistance to this impulse, Naila Kabeer notes, how ""the dress and deportment of Bengali women took on increasing symbolic value as expressions of their cultural difference"" and that ""the right to sing the songs of Tagore and to wear bindis became acts of political dissent"" (""The Quest for National Identity: Women Islam and the State in Bangladesh""). The left-dominated struggle for Bangladeshi autonomy was simultaneously a demand for elementary civil liberties. The freedom struggle entailed the freeing of women's bodies and sensibilities in the most quotidian domains.

The mass sexual brutalities visited upon East Pakistani Bengali women by Pakistani soldiers likewise drew women qua women into the liberation movement. The freedom struggle encouraged women's participation and garnered wide support from them.

***

I close with an excerpt from Ekattorer Dinguli that evokes Imam's multidimensional involvement in the revolutionary politics of her country, both as nurturer and protector: One evening when she and her husband were sitting in their garden, two guerillas arrived to collect information her husband has compiled on bridges and culverts in the country (as possible targets for guerilla operations):

When Sharif glanced at me, I rose and went inside … the dining table was uncluttered, the curtains were drawn. Going into the kitchen, I told Qasem, ""Sauté four shammi kebabs and two croquettes right away."" From the refrigerator, I took out the rasmalai and, putting some in a bowl, I further instructed him with, ""In about fifteen minutes, once you're done sautéing, arrange the refreshments on a tray, and place it on the dining table along with quarter plates, cutlery, and water. I won't come in again. Do you understand?""

I went back outside and looked around. I saw no one at the windows of the nearby houses, the road too was deserted. I said to Sharif, ""Go sit at the dining table."" The three of them went inside, while I sat in the garden keeping watch over the gate. My heart was pounding. I ached to join them. To hear from them, about Rumi. But I couldn't leave the gate unguarded. Jami couldn't find a worse time to fall sick.

It was darkening. Sajjad, the son of Reza Saheb, … came to the gate, ""Auntie, I need to use the phone."" I lied, ""But it isn't working."" As soon as he left, I rushed inside. If someone calls right now, it'll be a problem. Climbing to the second floor, I dialed ""1"" on the bedroom extension and put the receiver down without returning it to the cradle.

With her younger son Jami indisposed, Imam assumed the task of keeping the premises safe for the two guerillas. The next morning, she rearranged the furniture in the living room to create a partition between the living room and the dining area. This gave the dining area greater privacy by shielding from the view of any unexpected visitor, the liberation warriors sheltering in her home. Though she did not, as many women did, carry a gun and become a soldier in uniform for her country, her very lack of uniform made her most valuable for the cause.

700,Concern about widespread gas leaks,"On Monday night, many residents in the capital complained of gas leaks. These complaints arose as people began detecting the smell of gas in various parts of Dhaka city. Now, Titas Gas has reassured citizens that there is no danger in lighting stoves and that the issue has been resolved.

However, this is a constant fear that people in the country must live with. Over the past few years, there have been a number of fire or blast incidents caused by accumulated gas in homes, industries, markets, and even at a mosque (in one known case). And, given the frequent fire incidents happening especially in the capital since the beginning of this year, it is not shocking that citizens' first response was to panic. All this points to the need for authorities to take issues of fire safety seriously, across the board. No gas leak or irregularity in building design should be taken lightly.

701,Plug the brain drain,"As a developing country, Bangladesh is a victim of brain drain. Generally, this issue is more prevalent among students who have access to higher education abroad. Although a large number of students migrate abroad for higher studies every year, the rate of return is declining alarmingly. According to UNESCO's ""Global Flow of Tertiary-Level Students"" report, 60,390 Bangladeshi students were pursuing higher studies abroad in 2017. This number is increasing at the rate of 10 percent every year. Most of them are settling permanently in those countries after completing their studies.

In our country, the idea of living abroad permanently is viewed as something prestigious. The potential of Bangladesh becoming an incompetent nation is not visible to most people. Besides high salaries, developed countries ensure a more secure life. These facilities are still inadequate in our country.

The inconsistency of the education system in Bangladesh and the inability to ensure world-class education is one of the reasons behind brain drain. When a research enthusiast realises that his/her lifelong dream cannot be fulfilled in their own country, he/she will naturally want to go abroad. According to the annual report of the University Grants Commission (UGC), 125 public and private universities of the country altogether spent only Tk 153 crore on research activities in 2019, which is only one percent of their total expenditure.

Rich nations are also indirectly luring talented people from less-developed and developing countries to contribute to their own development. But it would be foolish to view Bangladesh's brain drain only through the few reasons mentioned above. Firstly, we must understand exactly which factors are discouraging a highly educated person from settling permanently in their homeland.

State policymakers need to think about issues related to quality of life, employment opportunities, social structure, financial security, development, gender equality, and freedom of all walks of life. After all, a state can only become full of opportunities with the contribution of its most skilled people.

702,Railway passengers need comfortable seating arrangement,"Tejgaon railway station is one of the busiest train stations in Dhaka. Every day, a lot of passengers use this station to go to different destinations by train. But sadly, there are not enough seats for the passengers to sit and take rest on the platform. Passengers often sit down by the rail lines risking their lives. Therefore, I urge authorities concerned to increase the number of seats at the station so that the passengers' waiting time becomes comfortable and no one has to take any risks.

703,Dhaka traffic made worse by our unruliness,"I think by now the whole world knows how bad traffic in Dhaka is. Things have gotten to a point where, instead of complaining about it or trying to figure out ways to eradicate this menace, we have simply accepted the fact that Dhaka traffic WILL eat up a chunk of our daily life. But must we make it worse by being reckless on the roads? Every day when I commute to and from work in Karwan Bazar, I see vehicles of all sorts plying the streets as they please – no order followed. We seem to forget that rules are there to make our lives easier. If we as drivers and/or pedestrians thought of being conscious and considerate of other people around us, maybe traffic in our capital city would be slightly less intolerable. As individuals, we need to internalise the fact that our roads are public spaces that we share with others, and so we should act responsibly when using them.

704,Let gamers be,"The gaming industry is already a multibillion dollar industry worldwide. In Bangladesh, the gaming scenario has seen a sharp progress in the last five years, with smartphones and fast internet spreading mobile gaming throughout the country. Everywhere we travel, we see people of all ages playing games on their phones, either alone or in a group.

The recent arrest of 108 youth gamers from a community centre in Chuadanga is quite bizarre. It should be understood that video gaming is an industry and an e-sport. In some developed countries, even e-sports visas are being provided. Some people are even earning their livelihoods through gaming.

As such, it is truly disheartening to discourage young gamers by arresting those only attempting to uphold the spirit of a new and thriving form of sport.

705,Give us our driver’s licence cards,"When I tried getting my driver's licence in 2019, it took me four months to get a date for the exam and another two to complete the biometric registration. Even though I managed to get the licence after that, I am yet to get my smart driver's licence three years later.

First, the BRTA authorised one company to print the licences, but that company got blacklisted. It then gave the job of printing 9 lakh licences to another company, which managed to print only 13,000 licences. The company currently expected to print licences is operated by the army. But they are also behind schedule.

Despite none of this being the people's fault, it is us who face harassment on the roads by traffic police. The government needs to address this.

706,"'We don’t want schedules, we want electricity'","This year we celebrated the inauguration of the mighty Padma bridge as a symbol of development in Bangladesh. Within a month of this opening event we are now going back to area-based load-shedding due to lack of gas supply. This is deplorable. We cannot have flamboyant celebrations of development in the transport sector and, at the same time, go backwards to worse days in the energy sector.

Our prime minister mentioned how Bangladesh is doing relatively well in the food sector compared to even some developed countries during inflation. Addressing the energy crisis the prime minister said she will consider making a schedule beforehand to keep people informed about the load shedding. Between all the talk of creating a digital Bangladesh, it is surprising how even in 2022 uninterrupted electricity supply has not yet become the norm. While the idea of having a schedule known to all about when they are about to lose power is better than not knowing, it is still not enough to be grateful about.

We have come a long way since the days of continuous load shedding. But now, with so many people working online, or remotely, and almost all corporate jobs and graduate-level education requiring the internet and electricity, we cannot settle for anything less than uninterrupted electricity.

As most parents are more focused on the academic results of their children, they try to use any extra time for academic subjects as well. This leaves us with a whole generation of children deprived of ever making an attempt to become experts in any form of art, other than the occasional mandatory painting classes at school.

Mohsin, an up and coming left-arm quick who returned figures of 1-26, defended 11 off the final over as Mumbai fell short of their 178-run victory target in Lucknow.

Tim David gave Lucknow a scare with his unbeaten 19-ball 32 but he and fellow Australian Cameron Green could do little against Mohsin's yorkers and discipline at the death.

Impact player Yash Thakur and leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi took two wickets each to add to Lucknow's bowling attack.

Lucknow swapped places with five-time winners Mumbai to jump to third in their bid for a top-four finish in the group stage for a play-off berth.

""We just lost the game. We didn't play well enough to win,"" said Mumbai skipper Rohit Sharma. ""There were moments we didn't win. Unfortunate but we need to keep our heads high.""

Holders Gujarat Titans have already booked their spot and assured a top-two finish. Seven off the 10 teams are fighting for the three remaining play-off places.

Stoinis set up victory for Lucknow after he put on key partnerships including an 89-run stand with skipper Krunal Pandya, who retired hurt on 49, to guide Lucknow to 177-3.

The Australian all-rounder walked in at 35-3 and rebuild the Lucknow innings with the left-handed Pandya on a not-so-easy pitch to bat.

Pandya was cramping in his knock and retired one short of fifty but Stoinis soon changed gears as he raised his fifty with a six and lay into Chris Jordan in a 24-run 18th over.

He put on an unbeaten 60-run stand off 24 balls with Nicholas Pooran, who made eight, and finished the innings with a six.

717,Two clubs back out of Women's DPL at eleventh hour,"The second and final day of the players' transfer for the upcoming Women's Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League was held at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday, but events took an unexpected turn as two clubs, Sheikh Russel KC and Ajax SC, no-showed for the second consecutive day, signaling their withdrawal from the league and creating uncertainty among the cricketers.

The 11-team tournament now looks to be a nine-team affair and national pacer Jahanara Alam expressed her frustration about the turn of events.

""I think it's disappointing for women's cricket that two clubs backed out from the league at the last moment. As you know, not all cricketers are financially solvent. It's a big blow for the girls who wait for the Dhaka league each year,"" Jahanara told the media yesterday.

""I recruited two cricketers who were supposed to represent Ajax SC for my team last night. But it's sad that many players are still looking for a team. I hope the BCB will handle such issues strongly in the future so no other team can back out from the league at the last moment.""

There are about four months left until the World Cup in India and the Tigers are planning to get their preparations right in the remaining matches. The conditions in Ireland provided a challenge and chasing down 320 in just 45 overs in the second ODI was a big boost.

""The 320 we chased down was very important. Then the match where we defended [a 274-run target in the third ODI]. Both matches were very important. These kinds of situations may arrive at the World Cup against big teams. We got a feel for both instances; how to chase and how to defend.

Bangladesh finished third in the ICC ODI Super League ahead of India, Pakistan and Australia and Shanto believed their form must continue. ""We are playing good cricket but there is room for improvement,"" he said.

Shanto was credited with putting forward good feedback to the team during the third ODI while defending 274. The left-handed batter was also electric on the field.

""Whenever the team is fielding, we all try to help out and give ideas we may have to bowlers or the captain. It's good we could do it and when it helps the team out, it's a good feeling.

720,Pakistan unhappy with new ICC revenue model,"The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is unhappy with the proposed new revenue distribution model for international cricket although it accepts that India, the game's financial engine, should get the biggest share, chairman Najam Sethi told Reuters.

The International Cricket Council (ICC), the game's global governing body, has proposed a new revenue sharing model for the 2024-27 cycle to be voted on at its next board meeting in June.

According to figures leaked to Cricinfo, India would claim 38.5%, while England and Australia would pocket 6.89% and 6.25% respectively. Pakistan stands to earn 5.75% of the ICC's projected earnings, primarily from its media rights sale.

The 12 full members of the ICC would collectively get 88.81%, while the rest would be distributed among its 96 associate members.

""We are insisting that the ICC should tell us how these figures were arrived at,"" Sethi told Reuters from London.

""We are not happy with the situation as it stands.

""Come June, when the board is expected to approve the financial model, unless these details are provided to us, we are not going to approve it.""

India generates an estimated 80% of ICC revenue and Disney Star shelled out $3 billion last year to acquire the 2024-27 media rights for the Indian market.

Sethi said the PCB had already asked the ICC to explain how its finance and commercial affairs committee, headed by Indian cricket board secretary Jay Shah, determined the share.

Despite the fact that all nations will get more money, Sethi said at least two other test playing nations were not happy with the model and had sought more details.

The ICC, which considered factors such as the performance of a country's men's and women's teams and their contribution to the ICC's commercial revenue, was not immediately available to comment.

""In principle, India should get more, there is no doubt about that but ... how is this table being developed?"" Sethi said.

The proposed revenue split has become a major talking point in world cricket, which is already facing a rapidly altering landscape because of the Indian-driven rise of franchise-based leagues.

Former England captain Mike Atherton, writing in The Times newspaper on Monday, criticised the ""flawed"" model, which he feared would only deepen the game's existing inequality.

""If that distribution comes to pass, then the strong will get stronger, the weak weaker (relatively) and international cricket will continue to become less competitive — which is in nobody's long-term interest,"" Atherton wrote.",2023-05-16 11:36:20,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/cricket/news/pakistan-unhappy-new-icc-revenue-model-3321621,2023-05-18 10:33:45,thedailystar
721,Jofra Archer ruled out of Ashes,"England fast bowler Jofra Archer was ruled out of the Ashes series against Australia on Tuesday, but a fit-again Jonny Bairstow returned to the Test squad for the one-off match against Ireland next month.

Archer, who has been ruled out ""for the rest of the summer"", spent 17 months on the sidelines following elbow and back injuries before returning to international cricket in January.

The 28-year-old played five matches for Mumbai Indians before the nagging injury ended his Indian Premier League (IPL) stint last week.

""It has been a frustrating and upsetting period for Jofra Archer,"" Rob Key, managing director for England men's cricket, said in a statement.

""He was making good progress until a recurrence of the elbow injury, which kept him out for an extended period previously. I'm sure we will see Jofra back to his best and winning games for England, whatever the format. Hopefully, sooner rather than later.""

Bairstow returned to the side after a freak golf injury in September that kept him out of the T20 World Cup in Australia.

Wicketkeeper Ben Foakes was dropped to accommodate Bairstow for the four-day contest against Ireland at Lord's from June 1.

""It was a seriously tough decision to leave Ben Foakes out of the squad,"" Key said.

""He has been excellent for England in the last year, but Jonny Bairstow is one of the best players in the world whose performances last summer epitomised what we are about.""

Warwickshire seamer Chris Woakes returns to the Test squad for the first time since March 2022, while Durham fast bowler Mark Wood is also back after skipping the tour of New Zealand.

The injuries suffered recently by skipper Ben Stokes (left knee) and seamer James Anderson (groin) did not appear serious, with both being named in the squad.

The Ashes series against Australia begins at Edgbaston on June 16.

723,"Real-City game a clash of Europe's best, says Ancelotti","Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti believes the two best teams in Europe will go head-to-head for a place in the Champions League final on Wednesday when the Spanish giants visit Manchester City.

The semifinal tie is delicately poised at 1-1 after the first leg in Madrid last week as City seek revenge for defeat at the same stage of the competition last season to Ancelotti's men.

""Madrid and City are in this moment the best teams in Europe and for sure it will be an exciting game, like it was in the first leg,"" said Ancelotti at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday.

City are unbeaten in 22 games as they close in on a potential treble of Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup.

But the English champions are yet to turn their domestic dominance under Pep Guardiola onto the European stage as City still await their first Champions League crown.

By contrast, Madrid's squad is filled with Champions League winners as the 14-times champions have conquered Europe five times in the last nine seasons.

""We have played a lot of these games - semi-finals, finals,"" said Madrid midfielder Luka Modric. ""We have confidence and calmness because we believe in our character and our qualities and that's what I see day in, day out.""

Ancelotti has a fully-fit squad to choose from after Eduardo Camavinga recovered from the injury that forced him off against Getafe on Saturday.

724,Ronaldo helps revive Al-Nassr hopes in Saudi title race,"Cristiano Ronaldo revived Al-Nassr's slim hopes of winning the Saudi Pro League title in his first season at the club after scoring a penalty to help them to a 2-0 victory over Al-Ta'ee on Tuesday.

With league leaders Al-Ittihad throwing away a two-goal advantage to draw 2-2 with Al-Hilal, Al-Nassr drew to within three points of the top spot with three games remaining in the season.

Al-Ittihad, however, still have the advantage in their head-to-head with Al-Nassr, the first tiebreaker if teams finish level on points.

At Al-Ta'ee Stadium in Ha'il, Ronaldo gave Al-Nassr the lead from the penalty spot just after halftime and Brazilian Talisca settled the game with another goal ten minutes from final whistle.

Ronaldo was also present, in spirit at least, at Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium in Riyadh as Al-Hilal scored controversial goals at the end of each half to battle back and hold Al-Ittihad to a draw.

Al-Ittihad took the lead through Igor Coronado and Ahmed Bamsoud in the first half an hour but Musab Aljuwayr cut the deficit four minutes before the break.

The teenager's cross appeared to have been kept in play by Al-Ittihad goalkeeper Marcelo Grohe and the game continued for more than a minute before VAR confirmed that the ball had in fact crossed the goal line.

It was a deja vu in stoppage time at the end of the match when Al-Hilal forward Michael's shot appeared to have been cleared by defender Ahmed Hegazy only for VAR to again confirm that the goal-line had been breached.

The Brazilian then rubbed salt into the wound and enraged the Al-Ittihad players by performing Ronaldo's trademark ""Siiii!"" goal celebration in front of the visiting fans.",2023-05-17 05:15:46,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/ronaldo-helps-revive-al-nassr-hopes-saudi-title-race-3322301,2023-05-18 10:33:49,thedailystar
725,'It's a dream come true',"Inter Milan coach Simone Inzaghi said he had been impressed by every facet of his team's ""extraordinary"" journey to the Champions League final after they beat AC Milan 3-0 on aggregate on Tuesday.

Lautaro Martinez's 74th minute goal sealed Inter's passage to the final of European club football's showpiece in Istanbul on June 10.

""We will only fully realise what we have done in the days to come,"" Inzaghi told Mediaset.

""It's a dream come true. We always believed we could do it, we have had an extraordinary journey (to the final).

""What pleased me? Everything. The running, the determination, the concentration... they were very good.""

He said he could now sit back and enjoy Wednesday's second leg of the other semi-final between Manchester City and Real Madrid which is finely poised at 1-1 from the first leg.

""They're obviously two of the best teams in Europe. The first match was well-balanced.

""I'll be watching the match with a great, great deal of interest!""

Inter have been European champions three times and their last crown came in 2010 when Jose Mourinho led them to a 2-0 victory against Bayern Munich in Madrid.",2023-05-17 04:59:41,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/its-dream-come-true-3322291,2023-05-18 10:33:51,thedailystar
726,‘I will watch Real-City game with a lot of interest’,"Inter Milan manager Simone Inzaghi said he never doubted that his team could reach the Champions League final as they completed a resounding 3-0 aggregate victory over rivals AC Milan on Tuesday.

A month ago, Inzaghi faced criticism and was under pressure after a lacklustre run of results, yet his side has turned it around and their 1-0 semi-final second leg win over Milan was their eighth in a row in all competitions.

""It was a dream at the start, but we always believed, we had an extraordinary run and to win the semi-final in a derby this way is immensely satisfying. We can only praise the lads,"" Inzaghi told Sport Mediaset.

Inter are third in Serie A and will face Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia final on May 24.

Their return to form has been built on a solid defence, keeping six clean sheets in their current winning streak and conceding only three goals.

""I had said a long while back we would put in a crazy effort without looking at one competition or the other, just trying to achieve our best,"" he said.

Inzaghi basked in the glory of his team's victory over Milan, a fourth successive win over their city rivals.

Milan had not suffered four defeats in a single campaign against Inter since the 1973-74 season.

""They showed strength, determination, aggression, concentration, they were wonderful,"" he said. ""We played four derbies since January and won all four, we know Milan are the Champions of Italy and have huge quality, but the players were excellent and deserve to enjoy this evening.""

Before their two semi-final victories, Inter beat Milan 3-0 to lift the Italian Supercup in January and grabbed a 1-0 win in Serie A the following month.

When asked whether he would prefer in the final to face Manchester City or Real Madrid, who play the second leg of their last-four tie on Wednesday, Inzaghi was keeping his cards close to his chest.

""It's normal that when you go to face City or Real you start underdogs, but football is always open: we met Real Madrid last year and we lost two games, but playing well. Manchester City needs no introduction: we will watch and whoever arrives will arrive.""

'I will watch the game with a lot of interest,' he added.

Inzaghi said that Serie A was now the primary focus for his players, who face newly crowned champions Napoli on Sunday.

""I gave the players a day off tomorrow because we haven't had it since April 1. It was deserved, We'll meet again from Thursday because we have to prepare for a league match in Naples.""

The Champions League final will be played at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul on June 10.

727,Lemos relishing Abahani-Mohammedan final,"Foysal Ahmed chases Daniel Colindres after the Costa Rican scored the opening goal in their Federation Cup semifinal against Sheikh Russel in Cumilla on Tuesday. Photo: Star

Coach Mario Lemos expressed his excitement after leading Abahani to the final of the Federation Cup against historic rivals Mohammedan following a 3-0 win over Sheikh Russel in the second semifinal at the Shaheed Dhirendra Nath Dutta Stadium in Cumilla yesterday.

The final, to be held in Cumilla on May 30, will be the first Federation Cup final between the country's two most popular clubs in 14 years, with the Black and Whites winning the last battle at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in 2009.

The two sides met later twice in cup finals during the 2009 Super Cup and 2011 Super Cup, with the Black and Whites winning the former and the Sky Blues having the last laugh two years later.

Mohammedan's 2-1 win against favourites Bashundhara Kings in the first semifinal last week means this will be the first Dhaka Derby final in more than a decade, a prospect that excited Lemos.

""I'm very excited. It's a big game with a lot of history. I think it's a game that is going to get the gallery full. People who love football and love Mohammedan-Abahani, hopefully we can have a good game and show them that Bangladesh football is still alive,"" the Portuguese told The Daily Star over phone following yesterday's victory.

Abahani are the defending champions and record 12-time winners of the Federation Cup, which had been a traditional curtain-raiser in Bangladesh football in the past. But is being held in concomitantly with the Bangladesh Premier League for the first time this season.

Both Abahani and Mohammedan are realistically out of contention for the Bangladesh Premier League title, with Abahani in second position, 10 points behind leaders Bashundhara Kings and Mohammedan sixth, a further 11 points behind. This is both teams' first chance to taste silverware this season, but Lemos was confident.

""I know it's not [going to be] easy, but when you are in a final, it's one game. It's a very tough game but we have to win. We have to play the same way we played today -- be patient, disciplined, organised and try to win the game,"" the long-term Abahani coach said.

After Sheikh Russel striker Mfon Udoh missed a couple of scoring chances, Costa Rican forward Daniel Colindres gave Abahani a 38th-minute lead with a powerful diagonal shot following a long-ball from Rezaul Karim.

Foysal Ahmed Fahim doubled that lead six minutes after the restart with a placed shot on a square pass from Raphael Augusto. The 24-year-old Bangladeshi forward wrapped up the victory with a floated attempt that Sheikh Russel keeper Ashraful Islam Rana failed to keep out in the 71st minute.

Lemos felt the team defended very well and were effective on the counterattack.

""Sheikh Russel are a very tough team to beat. We played three times against them. We lost one, we drew one and we won on penalties in the group stage of the Federation Cup. I thought it would be a 1-0, 2-0 or a 2-1 -- a very tight game. We defended very well and attacked very well. It was a good win for us,"" Lemos added.",2023-05-17 02:45:26,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/lemos-relishing-abahani-mohammedan-final-3321766,2023-05-18 10:33:53,thedailystar
728,Inter best Milan again to reach CL final,"Inter Milan forward Lautaro Martinez scored the only goal of the second leg of the Champions League semifinal against AC Milan to hand the Nerazzurri a 3-0 win on aggregate and secure a place in the final of Europe’s elite competition. Photo: AFP

Inter Milan reached their first Champions League final for 13 years as Lautaro Martinez's sole goal of the match gave them a 3-0 aggregate win against AC Milan on Tuesday.

Inter will undoubtedly be the underdogs against either Real Madrid or Manchester City in Istanbul on June 10, but the way they managed both legs of this all-Milan tie suggests they will be hard to beat.

The key moment of the night at the San Siro came when Argentinian Martinez exchanged passes with substitute Romelu Lukaku and drilled a shot from inside the penalty area that Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan allowed in at his near post.

Martinez, Inter's captain, hailed the cohesion of his team over the two matches against their city rivals.

""What counts is the squad. I experienced it at the World Cup (with Argentina),"" he said.

""It makes it easy if you have a united squad with everyone pulling in the same direction. It means you get to play these very important matches in the best possible way.""

He added: ""After winning the World Cup and experiencing what is the pinnacle for a player I knew we could reach this final, and we did it.""

His goal effectively killed off the tie.

Trailing 2-0 from the first leg, Milan had pushed hard in the first half, spearheaded by Rafael Leao who shot across the goal and past the post with one of his side's best chances.

Maignan then superbly dropped to his knees to collect Edin Dzeko's glancing header from Hakan Calhanoglu's pacy free-kick. Lukaku's introduction in the second half proved the spark that Inter needed to extend their lead.

Absent for much of the season with injuries and with a damaged reputation following a disastrous World Cup with Belgium, Lukaku has slowly worked his way back to his best.

The forward on loan from Chelsea immediately caused problems in the Milan defence and created Martinez's goal to guarantee their place in their first Champions League final since the last time they won European club football's biggest prize under Jose Mourinho in 2010.

""Tutti a Istanbul"", the joyous Inter fans sang with the Nerazzurri now one game away from a fourth Champions League title.

Inter coach Simone Inzaghi said: ""It's a dream come true. We always believed we could do it, we have had an extraordinary journey (to the final).

""What pleased me? Everything. The running, the determination, the concentration... they were very good.""

Facing Inzaghi's men will be either Manchester City or record 14-time winners Real Madrid, with that semi-final finely poised at 1-1 ahead of Wednesday's decider at City's Etihad Stadium.

""We're going to have to give it our all,"" Martinez said.

Milan's coach Stefano Pioli was left to contemplate a harsh ending to ""a terrific"" run to the last four.

""It's normal to be disappointed after losing in the semi-final, especially in a derby.

""The players gave their all in both legs but Inter deserved it. They played better than us, winning both matches.

""Given our journey and what we've done over the past three years it would have been fabulous to get to the final. But we didn't make it, that's a massive disappointment.""",2023-05-16 23:12:37,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/inter-best-milan-again-reach-cl-final-3322246,2023-05-18 10:33:54,thedailystar

Novak Djokovic eased into the Italian Open quarter-finals on Tuesday after breezing past Cameron Norrie 6-3, 6-4, although there was tension with the Briton after the top seed was hit by a smash.

The Serb has reached the last eight in each of his previous 16 appearances in the Italian capital and he did again on Tuesday, getting past Norrie on centre court to set up a clash with either Alexei Popyrin or Holger Rune.

Djokovic is gunning for a seventh title on clay in Rome and his chances have been made a little bit easier by the shock elimination of Carlos Alcaraz on Monday.

Alcaraz, who won two consecutive tournaments at Barcelona and Madrid, will take world number one spot from Djokovic on May 22 but it is the 22-time Grand Slam champion who could go into Roland Garros with yet another title under his belt.

Djokovic won the first three games against Norrie and closed out the first set with little fuss, without needing to be at his best.

The 35-year-old then took the second set to 2-1 with a break, but in the next game Norrie broke back while angering Djokovic with a smash which hit him on the back of his left leg.

Norrie had the whole court to put the ball away as Djokovic had given up on the point and was walking back to the service line.

Norrie raised his hand to apologise but at the changeover after the Briton moved to 3-2 Djokovic gave him another long beady-eyed stare as he passed him.

And after Djokovic sealed victory with his second match point he gave Norrie a cursory handshake at the net, while avoiding eye contact and exchanging no words with his dispatched opponent.",2023-05-16 12:42:51,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/more-sports/tennis/news/djokovic-sees-norrie-reach-italian-open-quarter-finals-3321691,2023-05-18 10:33:59,thedailystar
733,The last-placed runner who became toast of Cambodia,"Everyone in Phnom Penh, it seems, wants a selfie with Bou Samnang.

The Cambodian runner has become a star of the Southeast Asian Games since her gritty performance in the 5,000m. Although she came last, her determination to finish the race under torrential rain charmed the country and even won plaudits from Prime Minister Hun Sen.

Videos of her crying after crossing the line have gone viral.

""I can say now I'm famous,"" the 20-year-old said at the Morodok Techo Stadium, the scene of her unlikely rise to prominence, where passers-by were lining up for photos with her.

""Although I lost, they support me from the bottom of their hearts.""

This week's race was not the first time Bou Samnang has had to show determination, but is the latest step on an athletics journey that started on ill-equipped dirt tracks and has defied health problems and bereavement.

""I knew I was losing. The rain was so heavy,"" said the Phnom Penh native, whose mother is a housewife and whose father died in an accident a few years ago.

""I had the right to abandon the race, but first I have a duty to represent Cambodia. So I did not give up.""

When she first started running while at secondary school on the capital's outskirts, facilities were spartan.

""We lacked everything to support training,"" she said. ""I had only one pair of shoes, almost no sports shirts. We just trained on normal surfaces, like flat concrete or sometimes just on the dirt ground.""

She joined the national athletics programme in 2016 and started to receive more support, before making the main squad five years later. She spent much of 2022 in China training for her country's first ever home Games.

But she has long suffered with anaemia, or a lack of red blood cells, and was feeling weak on the day of her big race.

""My trainer said because of my health condition I should not do it. But because of the nation, I committed myself to the race,"" she said.

The eventual winner was Vietnam's Thi Oanh Nguyen, one of the region's finest athletes. Five minutes later, after the heavens opened, Bou Samnang was still going.

""I tried to reach the finish line because I wanted to show people that in life, even though we go a bit slow or fast, we will reach our destination all the same,"" she said. ""So we should not give up. We should try our best.""

The rain-sodden Cambodian finished in 22 minutes and 54 seconds, just under six minutes after Oanh.

""When I reached the finish line, I was quite disappointed, because I did not win, but I was also happy; although they knew I lost the race, (supporters) encouraged me. I did not expect the video to go viral, I really thank them for their support.""

Hosting the Southeast Asian Games is a big occasion for Cambodia, a country which has faced plenty of adversity itself, with civil war and genocide still in living memory. The government has in recent years tried to promote and fund sports in the run-up to the event.

Moved by her spirit, many officials and bodies have given Bou Samnang cash bonuses since the race, including Hun Sen, who said he gave her a $10,000 reward ""to encourage perseverance"".

""I will use the money to support my family,"" she told AFP, adding that she would like to pay off her mum's debts, as well as fund her own education.

She plans to enrol in university this year, in IT and law, while continuing her athletics career. Some schools have already offered scholarships.

But she will still be an athlete, with eyes on the next Southeast Asian Games in Thailand.

""In the future, if there is an event in Thailand or other countries, I will try my best for the country,"" she said. ""I will try my best in the future to get the reward for my nation, and for my supporters.""",2023-05-16 08:34:59,https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/more-sports/athletics/news/the-last-placed-runner-who-became-toast-cambodia-3321511,2023-05-18 10:34:00,thedailystar

World number one Carlos Alcaraz suffered a shock third round defeat in the Italian Open at the hands of unheralded Hungarian Fabian Marozsan, losing 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) on Monday.

The 20-year-old Spaniard had come into the tournament on the back of wins in Barcelona and Madrid but was outplayed by Marozsan, who is ranked 135th in the world.

Marozsan, 23, won the final six points of the second-set tiebreaker to hand US Open champion Alcaraz a wake-up call with the French Open starting in less than a fortnight.

Marozsan, who next plays Borna Coric for a place in the quarter-finals, had not won a match on the ATP Tour prior to the tournament -- indeed this is the first time he has qualified for the main draw at a tournament on the Tour.

""Everything was perfect today, I was doing my job,"" the winner said. ""I cannot imagine this win, even if it was my dream last night.

""I thought I might win a few games or a set.

""I tried to hit back every ball, I was trying to do my best.""

Marozsan produced 24 winners in a victory which took an hour and three quarters.

""I had hoped I could do something special,"" he said. ""Now I've just beaten the best in the sport so I'm very happy.""

Alcaraz now stands 30-3 on the season as he prepares to head to Roland Garros as top seed for the first time at a Grand Slam.

745,Literature showcases a different side to the Korean Wave,"The books coming out of Korea are brutal in how they push the audience right back into the bleakness of reality

Also known as Hallyu, the Korean Wave has been in full swing for years, spreading the culture and art of South Korea as an economy through all imaginable means of entertainment. Be it pop culture, music, or cinema, it's clear that most consumers of any media are at the very least aware of Korean entertainment, if not actively participating in it.

While Hallyu has, in some shape, existed since 1999 (credited largely to the movie Swiri), it has taken an enormous precedent in the eyes of the Korean government only in the last decade. In 2019 alone, all media attributed to the Hallyu movement added a net total of 12.3 Billion US dollars, and this has rather obviously prompted the government to invest further into all media released from South Korea to capture audiences' hearts. To the eyes of millions of fans worldwide, what really makes the K-wave so appealing is the many unique, and often uplifting, stories coming out of the country that challenge social conventions through their entertainment.

All of this brings us to one of the contributing factors of Hallyu that frequently get swept under the rug in conversations: literature. With massive contributions from the government, as well as the establishment of the Literature Translation Institute (LTI) of Korea, this is a field that has seen exponential growth in popularity over the last decade. They have, however, attracted a different sort of crowd. Where so much of Korean entertainment (both in music and drama) focuses on uplifting or escapist entertainment, the books coming out of Korea are brutal in how they push the audience right back into the bleakness of reality. They are often laced with commentary on the politics and social structure of their country, provided through lenses that are sometimes bizarre yet always gripping.

None of this would have been possible without the work done by translators. Perhaps the most important task carried out in the process of globalising Korean literature falls into their hands, and it is also perhaps the biggest point of difference between literature and other components of the K-wave.

For me, the journey into Korean literature began somewhere around 2017. I had been recommended The Vegetarian—a novel by Han Kang translated to the English by Deborah Smith—and, without any prior knowledge about the book, I decided to dive in. At the time, my knowledge of Korean culture was limited, and the internal politics of South Korea was still an undiscovered land to my eyes. The only information I had then was that The Vegetarian had won the 2016 International Booker Prize and had exploded into popularity not long after.

In hindsight, The Vegetarian was the oddest of books to use as a gateway into Korean literature. It was—and still is—the most widely celebrated book to come out of South Korea in recent times, but the content of the book is laced with an emotional weight so profound it serves as a whiplash when juxtaposed against the more uplifting counterparts of Hallyu. And yet, even as I call it 'odd', there is no denying the power exuding out of every word on the page. The story follows Yeong-hye after she makes the sudden decision to stop eating meat, something which drives her husband and the rest of her family into confusion and disarray. Abstract in presentation, the novel delves deep into the way people react when decisions are made that go against culture. This book, and by extension all of Han Kang's work, strikes me less as a direct critique of the social structures we live under and more as an exploration of characters attempting to transcend these shackles.

Kang also does not shy away from placing the reader right in the middle of Korea's dark history. Human Acts, the first of her novels translated into English (also by Deborah Smith), follows fictional characters directly tied to or affected by the Gwangju Massacre of 1980. Kang once again places her characters—and us—in the middle of one of Korea's darkest hours, one that shaped Kang's life greatly, and tries desperately to find a way to fight back against the oppression and the sorrow.

The struggle against these pre-existing systems, then, seems to take centre stage in so many books coming out of Korea. In fact, many of these award-winning stories are written by women and marginalised authors who place their struggle against the elite-dominated, patriarchal systems of Korea front and centre. This is not, by any means, completely unique to only the books of Hallyu, but it is certainly interesting to note how prevalent their voices have become in South Korean literature. In my opinion, the unvarnished display of life in these stories and the emotional strife presented within these characters play a big role in ensuring readers' continued fondness for these books. These are at once problems that are specific to Korea, but the effects they cause are like tendrils that haunt readers from all over the world.

Jumping forward in time, another notable work coming from South Korea is 2022's Cursed Bunny written by Bora Chung and translated by Anton Hur. This collection of short stories made it to the shortlist for last year's International Booker Prize award and presents stories that are always dazzling and grotesque but rarely do they spell out the truth hidden underneath all the creepy tales. Then there's Love In the Big City by Park Sang-Young and also translated by Anton Hur; the book is a queer coming-of-age story also published in 2022, which went on to be part of the International Booker Prize's long list. All of these books, with all their stylistic differences, offer an intimate look at life in Korea, and of the many ways characters struggle with their identity against patriarchy and abuse in a flashy world with an underbelly that's often overlooked.

None of this would have been possible without the work done by translators. Perhaps the most important task carried out in the process of globalising Korean literature falls into their hands, and it is also perhaps the biggest point of difference between literature and other components of the K-wave. Music, drama, and movies incorporate the use of translators but rarely do they ever play such an important role as in the translation of books. To that end, Korea's Literature Translation Institute has made notable investments to promote the spread of literature. The many awards received by Korean authors in the past decade alone are proof why the literature of Hallyu, though different, serves an equally important purpose in immortalising Korean media across all mediums.

There is also no denying the presence of other forms of literature that have become massively popular worldwide. Manhwa, for instance, serves as a direct competition to Japanese Manga and is popular amongst similar crowds. Webtoons is a popular platform hosting many Manhwa each with its own distinct way of telling stories. These too range from escapist entertainment to stories with complex social commentary, allowing the reader a greater range to select from depending on their taste.

Poetry as a genre is less popular and there has not been a dedicated effort by the Korean government to globalise this art form. Yet, it is to be noted that many Korean authors, including some mentioned in this article, are poets with their own bodies of work.

Since 2017, I have spent a rather significant amount of time exploring Korean literature—and the involvement it has with the L-wave. With each passing day, I have found myself discovering hitherto unexplored worlds under this banner.

746,‘The Hunger Games’ and the danger of desensitisation to violence,"In making the Hunger Games unglamorous, Suzanne Collins challenges the audience to reflect on how they view violence in entertainment

While The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (2023) will be returning to the world of Panem, the film will have significant differences from the original The Hunger Games movie quartet. The upcoming prequel, based on Suzanne Collins' 2020 book of the same name, is directed by Francis Lawrence, who also helmed the last three Hunger Games movies. It is set 64 years before the first film's events, following a young Coriolanus Snow's (Tom Blyth) rise to power.

Snow is a mentor during the 10th annual Hunger Games, where he is chosen to oversee one of the tributes. He's disappointed to find his mentee is Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a girl from the impoverished District 12. Over six decades later, Snow would be president with a war brewing from the opposition led by Katniss Everdeen, the female tribute from that same district.

By watching and celebrating the Hunger Games, citizens of the Capitol in the original series indicate that the tributes are beneath them and undeserving of the same respect and security. Despite their exaggerated displays of emotions throughout the course of the Games, such as laughing and weeping during the interviews with Caesar Flickerman, the Capitol citizens do nothing to act on these feelings and instead, enjoy the suffering on their screens. They demand real pain and death as entertainment, even though they lack authentic suffering in their own lives.

In the books, the Games are presented as a major spectacle, complete with extravagant costumes, makeup, and hairstyles for the tributes, as well as an assortment of high-tech gadgets and weapons to dissuade people from scrutinising their true motives. The movies mirrored this approach through exclusive marketing strategies such as Capitol Couture. By creating a sense of scarcity around the limited edition clothing line, the films generated excitement and anticipation among fans who wanted to own a piece of the Hunger Games franchise. But what are we saying if we buy these clothes—aren't we buying into the very thing that Collins' books try to warn us against?

As I read the prequel, I was horrified to find myself excited about the Games and comparing them to those of the original trilogy.

But in this story, the Capitol has not yet become a hub of wasteful decadence, as it is fresh from the destruction of the First Rebellion. The Games take place in a crumbling arena of indeterminable size, once used for military parades, and further damaged by an unsuspected bomb attack—more akin to the Roman gladiator games that inspired Collins than the futuristic environment seen in the original trilogy. They also lack the bloodthirsty audience from The Hunger Games. Not that many people enjoy watching the Games yet, even within the Capitol. They don't doubt their necessity—the war between districts and Capitol is only 10 years gone, and everyone remembers the deprivation and the horror of the violence and is eager for it to be avenged on their enemies—but they find the Games dull. In making the Games unglamorous, Collins challenges the audience to reflect on how they view violence in entertainment.

What ultimately separates the prequel from the original series is that it heavily focuses on the politics and scandals that eventually turned the Games into what they became.

Ballad shows how Snow becomes the sadistic leader from The Hunger Games and the lengths he was willing to go to politically secure himself as a powerful individual in Panem.

Video of The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023) Official Trailer The movie will release in theatres on November 17, 2023.

Here, instead of being thrust into the arena by a cruel Capitol with Katniss, we become spectators, watching children being forced to fight each other to the death in a rudimentary death match. In the same vein as the book, the film too must address how looking over the shoulder of mentor Snow makes us more complicit in the Games, ensuring their seamless execution. Collins forces the audience to think about what they would do, not to make it out alive, but if given the control.

The Hunger Games franchise's exploration of themes such as power, survival, and social injustice have captured the imagination of millions around the world. However, a significant part of its appeal lies in its depiction of violence, particularly the brutal and graphic nature of the titular games. While this violence is necessary to convey the story's messages and themes, it also raises concerns about the ethical implications of using violence as entertainment, especially in a world where real-life violence and suffering are all too common.

While the story sheds light on critical social and political issues, its graphic and stylised portrayal of violence could desensitise the audience to real-life violence and glamorise the very behaviour that it seeks to condemn. The franchise highlights the importance of using entertainment to educate and inspire, while also being mindful of its potential impact.

When the announcement first came that Ballad would be Snow's origin story, fans reacted with outrage. Were they really going to be asked to sympathise with a fictional fascist? Would Collins try to justify all the atrocities we knew he was going to commit by giving him a tragic past?

But nothing of the sort happens. Snow is a player from the beginning, analysing every person he meets for their value to his prospects and then either abandoning them or relentlessly buttering them up. Although Lucy Gray regards him as a good person who treats her with humanity, as readers we are aware that he only does this to engage the audience by presenting her as more human than the other tributes. Snow views the rest of the tributes as little better than animals.

As his attachment to Lucy Gray grows, Collins doesn't leave us much space to imagine that his interest in her is due to her inherent human worth.

The calculation and coldness make Snow a tricky protagonist. Collins has no interest in making him sympathetic or a person to root for, but she does have to maintain the readers' interest in him all the same; the film must stay true to the author's vision, and refrain from glorifying his character.

The Hunger Games books and movies solidified themselves in pop culture primarily through the strength found in its heroine, Katniss. Additionally, the brutality of the world she existed in made it easier to root for many of the decisions she made.

Now, a film focusing on Snow, one of YA fiction's most despicable villains, is sure to be divisive since most people familiar with the franchise know what he later becomes. Ballad shifts the focus from the original series, highlighting government politics and machinations over the Games' brutality and the regime's savagery. While this makes the prequel feel less like a tale of resistance, those who want a more exciting Hunger Games, such as the gory battles of fan favourites Johanna, Finnick, or Haymitch, should reflect on why they derive entertainment from such violence.

747,"How you too can nearly, almost, probably become a Jedi Knight","At its core, 'Star Wars' is a classic tale of underdogs taking on a powerful enemy; it's a story of hope and perseverance, of standing up for what's right even when the odds are against you

In a time far, far away called the 90's, a kid growing up in an internet-devoid Bangladesh found a book on a shelf in a cousin's house. It was a darkly painted cover like an 80's rock album, slightly dusty, pages yellowy despite being a rather new book. And it smelled like, well, pages. You know that paper bound aroma. It's a smell that has the power to tell entire stories when you grow up, find an old book and take a whiff again.

The book cover showed a painting of two hands clasped around a lit up sword. Glowing, fizzing with electrifying intent, ready to burn through the pages. A lightsaber. I was that kid and I did not know it then, but in a few weeks every broom, plastic scale, rolled up newspaper or ratty broken branch was about to become a lightsaber in my hands.

The book was The Return of The Jedi (Del Rey, 1983)--the third of the trilogy. What I did not know is that I had started from the end of the series without a care in the world because… lightsabers. My English vocabulary was just starting off from Thundercats on Friday mornings. But I persevered. I needed to read that book. See, on the cover it stated that it had a ""Fabulous 8 page color insert"". Fabulous it was. This was eight pages of movie stills from the most epic Star Wars movie. I didn't know who Han Solo was, but R2D2 stole my 10-year-old heart. Then there was Princess Leia and her headphone-style hairdo. So retro and yet so futuristic.

I was hooked like a Sith Lord on power converters. It took me a month to read that concise book that was an adaptation of a movie. And then I read it a few times more till the pages became dog-eared. Wouldn't a movie have been an easier fix? We had something called video rental shops. These were shady small establishments smelling of incense and housing shelves full of potentially soul destroying labels glued onto black VHS cassettes. Also, they did not keep ""old"" movies from 1983 in stock. Amitabh Bachchan was a bigger draw in the Dhaka of the early 90's.

But Star Wars captured my imagination like nothing else. Maybe it was the idea of space travel, or the iconic characters and their unique personalities. Or perhaps the fact that you could drop a lightsaber vertically downward and it might potentially poke a hole through to Australia. Reading that book opened up a whole new world to me. It was more than just a movie adaptation–it was a portal to a galaxy far, far away. I devoured every Star Wars book I could get my hands on from then on, and they helped me to understand why it is such a great story.

At its core, Star Wars is a classic tale of underdogs taking on a powerful enemy. It's a story of hope and perseverance, of standing up for what's right even when the odds are against you. Much like the Rebels fighting the Empire or me facing my music teacher at school. This teacher could make direct lethal contact using a chalk from 20 feet. And for a kid growing up in a time before smartphones and the internet, it was a world of endless possibilities.

As I grew up and saved up much of my lunch money, I discovered that the Star Wars universe was much more expansive than I ever could have imagined. There were comics, animated series, and even movies. Some of the better picks when it came to reading Star Wars included the Thrawn Trilogy by Timothy Zahn and the X-Wing series by Michael A. Stackpole. But no matter where you started, the message of Star Wars remained the same: take risks, but trust your gut. I haven't quite mastered that advice since I regularly eat street food, much to the morning after-dismay of my gut. But I hope to eventually get there. After all, it usually takes around 20 years to become a Jedi Knight.

As a cultural phenomenon, Star Wars has had a lasting impact on popular culture since the release of the first film in 1978. It has spawned a vast array of merchandise, from action figures to clothing, to kitchen appliances. And while the franchise has had its ups and downs over the years, it has continued to captivate audiences of all ages and backgrounds.

One of the reasons why Star Wars is so beloved is its ability to transport the audience to another world. It has a rich and complex mythology, with its own unique languages, planets, and creatures. It's a universe that feels both familiar and completely foreign at the same time. And as a kid, it was a world I could escape to whenever I needed a break from reality.

But Star Wars is more than just escapism. It has always tackled big ideas, such as the battle between good and evil, the power of redemption, and the importance of friendship and family. These themes resonate with audiences of all ages, and it is one of the reasons why the franchise has remained relevant for over four decades. This is a recurring theme even in the much maligned solo Solo movie.

As a grownup with two kids of my own, I love watching them play with lightsabers and droids, knowing that they too are experiencing the magic of Star Wars amidst the screaming. And on May the 4th, I'm reminded of how this story has impacted my life and countless others around the world.

In a world where it's easy to feel powerless, Star Wars reminds us that anyone can make a difference. Whether you're a Jedi Knight or just a kid with a book, you have the power to shape the world around you. It continues to inspire us to dream big and reach for the stars. At the very least, roll up a newspaper or pick up a stick and challenge someone to a Jedi duel.

748,My first foray into fiction with Feluda,"In memory of author and filmmaker Satyajit Ray, born on May 2, 2023

While book lovers around the world grew up with the likes of Agatha Christie classics and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes as their entrance into the world of mysteries and sleuthing, it was Satyajit Ray's Feluda that introduced me to the magic of detective novels, and fiction in general. In fact, my earliest memories of reading are flashes of me spending summers lazing around and reading Feluda to chase away the sweltering boredom of loadsheddings.

The Feluda series is, in a way, a rite of passage for any Bangla literature enthusiast, and I was no exception to this. It is difficult to recall the first Feluda adventure that I read, but the feeling of fascination that the world of the Bengali detective held for me, still lingers in my skin like an age-old crush. The credit for my love for Feluda belongs to my elder brother, the source of all my childhood interests. The exact instance eludes me but it most certainly was his collection of the detective novels that gave me the push to start the series.

Growing up in a family with a deep appreciation for Satyajit Ray's work, my fascination with the Feluda series was almost inevitable. Ray's films, including Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne and Hirok Rajar Deshe, were beloved staples in our household. While I didn't initially connect them with the Feluda books, adaptations such as Sonar Kella and Joi Baba Felunath were also popular and regularly watched. In fact, if Sonar Kella were to air today, my father would undoubtedly be just as captivated as he was when it first aired in the 90s.

Although widely regarded as the best adaptations of the series, I initially overlooked the brilliance of these two movies, likely due to my overexposure to them from a young age. Instead, I grew to associate the telefilms from the late 90s as the quintessential representations of the detective novels, perhaps because of my introduction to the series around the time of their airing. My memories of the telefilms remain hazy except for scenes of Feluda lounging in his living room while meeting his clients, but I can still remember being drawn to his deep, gravelly voice, and believing that no detective is complete without one.

Growing up, I never analysed what drew me to the Feluda novels. It is only now that I marvel at how Feluda remained the sole fiction novel read at leisure by a self-proclaimed Bookworm such as myself for so long in my childhood. While I exclude comics like Tintin and Asterix and Obelix from this, as comics and graphic novels require less to keep a reader hooked, Feluda was the only series I repeatedly returned to until my teenage introduction to Harry Potter.

I subconsciously attributed this fascination to the straightforward nature of the storytelling and the thrill of the quintessential mystery for a long time. It was only after I reread the series in my university days, and being an early sleeper, I found myself staying awake till 2 in the night, hooked to the Royal Bengal Rahashya. I had been exposed to the renowned masters of mystery from Jeffery Archer to John Grisham, Arthur Conan Doyle to Agatha Christie, Stephen King to Dan Brown, by then. So how could such a supposedly archetypal detective series still continue to have such hold over me?

I believe it boils down to two things. Firstly, the Feluda books transport you to different places. Each adventure reads like a mini-travelogue, with Feluda journeying to solve cases in various cities and states—from the winding streets of Darjeeling to the sprawling deserts and ancient forts of Jaisalmer, to the damp and secluded alleyways of Benaras and the lush hills of Pahalgam, and of course the urban lanes of Kolkata. Ray skillfully intertwines the stories with the settings to the point where the locations themselves become a character. As a child, reading these adventures made me dream of travelling to these places.

Secondly, Ray has a way of captivating readers with his seemingly simple writing and vocabulary. He has an innate ability to transport you to a parallel world and create relatable characters. His hero, Prodosh Chandra Mitra, lovingly known as Feluda, the titular sleuth and quintessential Bengali man, is tall, fit, and well-spoken with an assured intellect and sense of humour, and the uprightness and honesty befitting a hero. Ray, inspired by Conan Doyle, also inserts grey traits into his hero, adding to his intrigue. These qualities make him admirable to readers and the narrator Topshe alike. But there are also the little things such as Feluda being a foodie and highly well-read with a love for puzzles which make him such a relatable character to me.

It is this balance of an intriguing persona and a groundedness that make him, to me, the most popular Bengali detective, and the reason that the charm of his books remains timeless.

754,"Imran Khan says police surrounding his house, fears re-arrest","Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said today said that police had surrounded his house and that he expected to be rearrested soon, after the government warned him to hand over supporters who it blamed for attacks on the army.

Khan was arrested by the army on May 9 on graft allegations, which he denies, triggering a wave of violence that has deepened political instability in the South Asian nation of 220 million. Pakistan has also been facing its worst-ever economic crisis, with a long delay in securing critical IMF funding.

The country's Supreme Court ordered Khan's release on bail last Friday.

But today the government accused him of sheltering aides and supporters wanted over the attacks following his arrest, and warned he had 24 hours to hand them over or face a police operation.

Khan, 70, a former captain of Pakistan's cricket team, said his re-arrest was imminent. Hours earlier, Islamabad's High Court had granted him a bail extension until May 31, his lawyer Faisal Chaudhry said.

""Probably my last tweet before my next arrest,"" Khan tweeted this evening, adding that police had surrounded his house in the eastern city of Lahore.

In a live video statement, he said his opponents were out to trigger a fight between him and the army.

""I'm afraid that this will bring a big backlash that will cause huge loss to our country,"" he said. ""... If someone thinks that this strategy can win a ban on my party, it is not going to happen.""

He demanded a judicial commission headed by the chief justice to probe the violence.

Punjab province's information minister Amir Mir said intelligence and law enforcement agencies had identified that some 30 to 40 people accused of attacking military installations were hiding at Khan's home.

""We're giving an ultimatum that these terrorists should be turned over to the police, or else there will be action,"" Mir told a press conference. He said Khan had 24 hours to surrender the suspects, and that a police operation would be launched if he did not comply.

Khan's aide, Iftikhar Durrani, denied the former PM was sheltering people suspected of involvement in the violence.

Khan, who has been rallying his supporters to demand a snap election since he was ousted in a parliamentary vote of confidence in April 2022, called on authorities to come to his house with arrest warrants rather than storming it.

MILITARY COURTS

Following Khan's arrest, thousands of supporters attacked and set on fire scores of government and public buildings, including the army's headquarters. More than 3,000 people are already in custody over the violence.

Federal Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb described the attacks on army installations as ""sedition"" saying those involved in them would be tried in military courts.

The military had already announced that those who attacked its installations would be tried under army laws, calling the May 9 attacks ""pre-planned"" and ordered by leaders of Khan's party, which he and his party deny.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), an independent civil rights group, said on Tuesday it opposed the use of military laws to try civilians, saying it risked denying their right to due process.",2023-05-17 15:05:10,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/asia/south-asia/news/imran-khan-says-police-surrounding-his-house-fears-re-arrest-3322661,2023-05-18 10:34:26,thedailystar
755,India's SC gives market watchdog 3 more months to finish Adani probe,"India's Supreme Court today granted Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) a three-month extension to complete its probe into allegations of stock price manipulation by Adani Group.

""SEBI is granted an extension of time till August 14, 2023 to submit its report,"" said the bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, reports our New Delhi correspondent.

The bench also directed SEBI to file an updated status report on the investigation. It has listed the matter for further hearing on July 11.

SEBI sought an extension of six months to complete the probe into allegations of stock price manipulation by the Adani group.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for SEBI, told the bench the six-month period was not enough to complete the investigations and urged it to re-consider the August deadline.

""You tell us what you have done because we had already granted you two months. We have granted you now further extension of three months which makes it five months. So, effectively you are asking for six months. We have granted you already five months,"" justice Chandrachud told Mehta.

""We are not granting an indefinite extension of time. If there is some genuine difficulty, you let us know,"" Justice Chandrachud added.

The apex court had on March 2 asked SEBI to probe within two months the allegations against the Adani group and also set up a panel to look at providing protection to Indian investors after a damning report by US short-seller Hindenburg wiped out more than USD 140 billion of the Indian conglomerate's market value.

756,Imran Khan's bail extended,"Supporters face trial in military courts

Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan secured an extension to his protective bail until May 31, his lawyer said today, as an official announced people involved in violent protests over his arrest would be tried in military courts.

Khan had been bailed by the Islamabad High Court last Friday following his May 9 arrest, which sparked violent protests across the country that killed at least eight people.

The court extended the bail, which had been due to expire today, because the prosecutor requested more time to produce details of the case against him, Khan's lawyer Faisal Chaudhry told Reuters.

The arrest of the former prime minister, who was ousted in a parliamentary confidence vote in April last year, has deepened political instability in the South Asian nation of 220 million.

Pakistan was already facing its worst ever economic crisis, with a long delay in securing an IMF funding which is critical to avert a balance of payment crisis.

Thousands of Khan supporters had attacked and set on fire scores of government and public buildings, including the army's headquarters, following his arrest.

Today the information minister for Punjab province, Amir Mir, said those accused of attacks on the army would be tried by military courts.

Rights groups have previously voiced concerns that military courts often conduct summary trials hearing only abridged evidence.

Khan, who is facing graft allegations he denies, has disowned those involved in arson, demanding an impartial inquiry.

757,UN wants $100 bn to boost digitalisation in poor countries,"The United Nations today demanded a tripling of pledges aimed at filling the global digitalisation gap, asking countries and the private sector to hike the funding to $100 billion by 2026.

Around 2.7 billion people around the world were offline in 2022, according to data from the International Telecommunications Union, the UN's telecoms agency.

""The digital connectivity divide separating the least developed countries from the rest of the world is widening,"" the ITU warned, launching an appeal for far more resources towards ensuring meaningful connectivity and digitalisation in the world's least developed countries (LDCs).

""Tech is at the top of the global agenda, but the benefits of digital technology are still out of reach for too many people,"" ITU chief Doreen Bogdan-Martin said in a statement.

""If we are serious about digitalising the world in a way that is meaningful and sustainable, we must take action to accelerate digital transformation for everyone.""

The world's 46 least developed countries are home to nearly one-third of the global offline population, the ITU said, lamenting that the internet is considered to be affordable in just two of those nations.

To rectify the situation, the ITU launched the Partner2Connect Digital Coalition in September 2021.

It is aimed at using public-private partnerships to help boost digitalisation in the world's hardest-to-connect communities, including LDCs, and developing countries that are landlocked or small island states.

That coalition began mobilising direct funding in February last year, and has so far raked in pledges of $30 billion, including $12 billion to bring LDCs online as quickly as possible, the ITU said.

In its statement, the ITU said it was launching ""a worldwide appeal calling to increase the value of pledges for digitalising the world from the current $30 billion to $100 billion by 2026"".",2023-05-17 14:57:03,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/world/news/un-wants-100-bn-boost-digitalisation-poor-countries-3322651,2023-05-18 10:34:29,thedailystar
758,EU should crack down on India for reselling Russian oil: Borrell,"EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell delivers a speech on the situation in Afghanistan during a plenary session at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, September 14, 2021. Julien Warnand/Pool via REUTERS

The European Union should crack down on India reselling Russian oil into Europe as refined fuel, including diesel, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in an interview with the Financial Times published on Tuesday.

India has emerged in the past year as a top buyer of Russian oil following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Access to cheap Russian crude has boosted output and profits at Indian refineries, enabling them to export refined products competitively to Europe and take a bigger market share.

Borrell told the newspaper he would raise the issue with India's foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, at a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday.

""If diesel or gasoline is entering Europe ... coming from India and being produced with Russian oil, that is certainly a circumvention of sanctions and member states have to take measures,"" the EU's chief diplomat said.

""That India buys Russian oil, it's normal... But if they use that in order to be a centre where Russian oil is being refined and by-products are being sold to us... we have to act,"" Borrell said.

In remarks after the meeting, Borrell said he had brought up Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including the issue of food security, in his talks with Jaishankar, but his remarks did not refer to Russian oil.

Jaishankar told a news conference his understanding of EU sanctions rules was that Russian crude substantially transformed in a third country was no longer considered to be a Russian product.

European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager said the EU would have a discussion with India on the issue ""but it will be with an extended hand and of course not with a pointed finger"".

Indian refiners, which rarely bought Russian oil previously due to high transport costs, imported 970,000-981,000 bpd of it in fiscal 2022/23 (April-March), accounting for more than a fifth of the country's overall fuel imports.

Russia's largest oil producer Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and top Indian refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS) have also signed a term deal to substantially increase and diversify oil grades delivered to India.

According to ship-tracking data from Kpler, Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) and Nayara Energy were the key exporters of refined fuels and buyers of Russian oil.

No immediate response was available from the companies.

India typically exported an average of 154,000 barrels per day (bpd) of diesel and jet fuel to Europe before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, that has increased to 200,000 bpd after the EU banned Russian oil products imports from Feb. 5 this year, data from Kpler shows.

Any mechanism to stem the flow of Russian oil would need to be implemented by the national authorities, Borrell told the FT, suggesting that the EU could target buyers of Indian refined fuels which it believes are derived from Russian crude.

""If they sell, it is because someone is buying. And we have to look at who is buying,"" he said.",2023-05-17 11:30:04,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/world/news/eu-should-crack-down-india-reselling-russian-oil-borrell-3322511,2023-05-18 10:34:31,thedailystar
759,"Air strikes, artillery fire escalate","Residents say Khartoum situation ‘unbearable’

Air strikes and artillery fire intensified sharply across Sudan's capital early yesterday, residents said, as the army sought to defend key bases from paramilitary rivals it has been fighting for more than a month.

The air strikes, explosions and clashes could be heard in the south of Khartoum, and there was heavy shelling across the River Nile in parts of the adjoining cities of Bahri and Omdurman, witnesses said.

The fighting between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has triggered unrest in other areas of Sudan, especially in the western region of Darfur, but is concentrated in Khartoum.

It has caused a humanitarian crisis that threatens to destabilise the region, displacing over 700,000 people inside Sudan and forcing about 200,000 to flee into neighbouring countries.

Those who have remained in the capital are struggling to survive as food supplies dwindle, health services collapse and lawlessness spreads.

Officials have recorded 676 deaths and more than 5,500 injuries, but real toll is expected to be far higher with many reports of bodies left in the streets and people struggling to bury dead.

""The situation is unbearable. We left our house to go to a neighbour's house in Khartoum, escaping from the war, but the bombardment follows us wherever we go,"" said Ayman Hassan, a 32-year-old resident.

""We don't know what the citizens did to deserve a war in the middle of the houses.""

Fighting has surged both in Khartoum and in Geneina, capital of West Darfur, since the two warring parties began talks in Jeddah brokered by Saudi Arabia and the United States more than a week ago.

The talks have produced a statement of principles about providing access for aid supplies and protecting civilians, but mechanisms for setting up humanitarian corridors and agreeing to a ceasefire are still being discussed.",2023-05-16 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/world/middle-east/news/air-strikes-artillery-fire-escalate-3322191,2023-05-18 10:34:32,thedailystar

French former president Nicolas Sarkozy lost his appeal against a 2021 conviction for corruption and influence peddling at the Paris Court of Appeals on Wednesday.

The court upheld a three-year prison sentence. It said two of those years were suspended and that Sarkozy would wear an electronic bracelet instead of going to jail for the remaining year.

Sarkozy arrived in court wearing a dark grey suit and appearing nervous. He fistbumped his lawyers and smiled occasionally as he took his seat before proceedings started.

A lower court in 2021 had found Sarkozy guilty of trying to bribe a judge after leaving office, and of peddling influence in exchange for confidential information about an investigation into his 2007 campaign finances.

It marked a stunning fall from grace for a former president who once bestrode the world, and is one of several legal battles Sarkozy has been fighting over the past decade.

761,Ukraine repels Russian attacks,"In first, Kyiv says it shoots down multiple hypersonic Kinzhal missiles; Moscow says ‘all targets hit’

Ukraine said yesterday it had shot down six Russian hypersonic Kinzhal missiles in a single night, thwarting a superweapon Moscow had previously touted as all but unstoppable.

It was the first time Ukraine had claimed to have struck an entire volley of multiple hypersonic missiles, and if confirmed would be a dramatic demonstration of the effectiveness of newly deployed Western air defences.

The six Kinzhals, ballistic missiles which travel at up to 10 times the speed of sound, were among a volley of 18 missiles Russia launched at Ukraine overnight, lighting up Kyiv with flashes and raining debris after they were blasted from the sky.

The commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi said all had been successfully intercepted. However, Russia said that all the targets assigned by its military in an overnight missile barrage on Ukraine had been hit.

City authorities in the Ukrainian capital said three people were wounded by falling debris.

""It was exceptional in its density - the maximum number of attack missiles in the shortest period of time,"" Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv's city military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app.

Zaluzhnyi said his forces had intercepted the six Kinzhals launched from aircraft, as well as nine Kalibr cruise missiles from ships in the Black Sea and three Iskanders fired from land.

Earlier this month, Ukraine claimed to have shot down a single Kinzhal missile over Kyiv for the first time, using a newly deployed U.S. Patriot air defence system.

Previously, the ability of Patriots to intercept Kinzhal missiles was theoretical. Hitting six at once would suggest it could be a reliable defence, rather than a lucky shot.

President Vladimir Putin, who unveiled the Kinzhal as one of six ""next generation"" weapons in 2018, has frequently touted it as proof of world-beating Russian military hardware, capable of taking on Nato.

The Kinzhal, whose name means dagger, can carry conventional or nuclear warheads up to 2,000 km. Russia used them in warfare for the first time in Ukraine last year and has only acknowledged firing them on a few occasions.

With Ukrainian forces preparing to go on the offensive for the first time in six months, Russia is now launching long-range air strikes. Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said yesterday Ukrainian forces have taken back about 20 square km of territory from Russian forces around the eastern city of Bakhmut in recent days.",2023-05-16 18:00:00,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/world/europe/news/ukraine-repels-russian-attacks-3322186,2023-05-18 10:34:34,thedailystar

764,Global price hike: Rural poor worst-hit,"Poor families dependent mostly on agriculture in Bangladesh's rural areas are worst-affected due to a hike in global commodity prices following the Russia-Ukraine war, a study reveals.

The economic crisis has pushed an estimated 3.0 million people into poverty while the national welfare reduced by 2.0 per cent, it added.

The study styled 'Impact of Ukraine Crisis on Bangladesh Economy Using Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Model' was presented during a session on the opening day of the two-day BIDS Research Almanac 2023.

The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) hosted the programme at a city hotel on Wednesday.

BIDS research fellow Tahreen Tahrima Chowdhury and International Food Policy Research Institute senior scientist Angga Pradesha presented the study paper.

Economic Research Group (ERG) executive director Sajjad Zohir was the session chair while Associate Professor Deen Islam of economics at Dhaka University and Assistant Professor Javed Hossain of economics at North South University were the discussants.

Presenting the paper on the impact of Ukraine crisis, Ms Tahrima said the research team analysed several issues, including petroleum, fertiliser, food price hike and exchange rate devaluation in Bangladesh.

Following the price hike of commodities like energy and fertiliser, she said Bangladesh had to adjust the prices, which ultimately created the shocks for marginal people.

Mr Pradesha presented the technical methodology of the study that used the CGE model.

CGE model is a class of economic model that uses actual economic data to estimate how an economy might react to changes in policy technology or other external factors.

According to Mr Pradesha, agriculture sector is the mostly affected sector given the strong interlinkages with the affected sectors.

The paper says fertiliser subsidy helps increase agricultural production the most while cash transfer is most effective in reducing poverty.

Cash transfer programme requires the least government budget than the subsidy programme but provides the highest impact in reducing poverty.

Two other papers on sustainable financing strategies for SMEs and RMG compliance measures were presented.

765,Safety compliance in RMG firms increases labour productivity,"Safety compliance taken in the country's readymade garment (RMG) factories, as prescribed by Accord and Alliance, has increased labour productivity while workers' efficiency is higher in big compliant units, according to a latest BIDS study.

It, however, also revealed that impacts of compliance on profit and market access are not 'significant'.

""[Though] a positive effect of compliance on real variables (labour productivity and profit) and market access was expected, results suggest an significant impact only on labour productivity,"" Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) research fellow Tahreen Tahrima Chowdhury said while presenting the study findings.

She was speaking at the second session of the two-day BIDS Research Almanac 2023 started on Wednesday at a city hotel.

Firms, which addressed a higher number of remediation measures, performed better in terms of increased labour productivity, she said, explaining that workers of the compliant firms feel safer at their factories compared to the workers of the non-compliant firms.

The compliant RMG firms might enjoy benefits of productivity enhancement in the future if they maintain the standard level of compliance, she suggested.

Since the study was done soon after implementation of compliance standards, it is unlikely to gauge the impact of safety compliance on firm performances, Ms Chowdhury said, suggesting that a several rounds of survey over time might help understand definitive impact of compliance standards on firm performances and profitability.

The study was conducted in 2019 to explore whether Accord-Alliance compliant RMG firms perform better compared to non-compliant ones, whether compliant ones with higher number of remediation measures gain more, and what the perception of workers was about the safety compliance during the period of 2014-2018.

A total of 322 firms located in Dhaka, Gazipur, Narayanganj and Chattogram were surveyed while some 179 firms participated in the compliance initiatives of any of the three initiatives, namely Accord, Alliance and National Initiative.

The rest 143 units were not inspected by any of the three initiatives.

At the same session, findings of two other reports - 'Impacts of the Russia-Ukraine War price shocks on the Bangladesh economy: a general equilibrium analysis', and 'Sustainable Financing Strategies for the SMEs: Two Alternative Models' - were shared.

Deen Islam, associate professor of the Department of Economics at Dhaka University, and Javed Hossain, assistant professor of the Department of Economics at North South University, were the discussants of the session, moderated by Sajjad Zohir, executive director of Economic Research Group.

Talking to reporters after his meeting with Foreign Secretary Dr Masud Bin Mamun, the Ansar DG said the personnel of the Ansar battalion had the same trainings like the army and they were provided with the latest models of light fire-arms.

He also mentioned that the members of the Ansar battalion have already been engaged in such types of protocol duties on the country including the parliament, the ICDDRB etc.

The foreign secretary said that they had discussed the modalities for providing additional security protocols for the envoys by the personnel of the Ansar Battalion.

Responding to a question, he said that the tariff for providing the service was under discussion.

The details will be notified to the concerned missions after everything is finalised, he added.

On Monday, Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen told the media about the government decision of withdrawal of additional police protocol for the envoys of four countries.

On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen told the media about the decision to engage Ansar Battalion members for providing security protocol to the envoys on payment.

He also mentioned that withdrawal of the additional protocol does not violate the Vienna Convention as the government is committed to providing full proof security to the foreign envoys and missions, said on Tuesday.

He also brushed aside the notion that this decision, which has been effective from Monday, would affect bilateral ties with the concerned countries.

The envoys of the USA, UK, India and Saudi Arabia used to get the additional police protocol.

Mr Masud also made it clear that the additional police protocol was not the part of the main security arrangement; rather it was provided in the wake of the threat of militancy.

767,Looking for small bliss all around,"Rabindranath lamented the inability to venture a couple of steps out of home and see from close quarters a dew drop on an ear of paddy. Although there is no dearth of enthusiasm in embarking on journeys across countries to see far off mountain ranges and seas, few people feel the urge to discover the joy and bliss in the luminous dew drop that hangs from a corn tip.

Indeed, it is in human nature to stay indifferent to the precious little gifts close by. People look far beyond for grand and imposing natural and man-made wonders. In search of thrill, romance and entertainment, they often miss the wood for the trees. Rabindranath asked such adventurers to pause and discover bliss in small marvels.

At a time when automation, robots and artificial intelligence (AI) are almost on a rampage, can the poet's appeal to the soft corner of hearts make any impact? The world is convulsing courtesy of human misdeeds and the most rational animal on the planet is yet to get back to his senses. It is this super animal that alone has brought about phenomenal changes in the natural order of this known world fostering life. His genius has come up with amazing inventions mostly for living more and more comfortably. But there is a limit to comfort. Comfort has given in to unlimited luxury and the Earth had to pay for this in various ways.

It had to bleed from within to supply fuels, minerals and precious materials for feeding industries, communications, high fashion and even the most vicious weaponry system that can destroy the planet many times over. It is a civilisation with many contradictions. If machines and gadgets have made many of the manual tasks easier to perform, the crazy invention called smartphone has diverted human minds to undesirable channels. The young generation, in particular with hardly any exception, has become dissociated from the natural world. Even a large section of adult and elderly people are honed in on social sites. For some it has become a pastime for others an addiction.

It is a kind of dissociation that sets aside man from Nature with no concern for the consequences of his action. Their world revolves around the virtual world. The world of flora and fauna have no appeal for them. Unaware they also get brutalised like the poor and abandoned street children who have to fend for themselves without knowing the love and care of parents.

In a way, the majority of today's generation in the face of atrocious discriminations lose the insight to find mirth and happiness in the gifts of Nature unfolding before their eyes. The shoots of grass and buds on a bough that first tentatively peep through and then gradually assume their unique shape, size and look cannot attract their attention. Similarly, the smallest of birds that dance on the branches of rooftop plants, the kites and eagles that float high in the sky and at times two of them putting up an aerial acrobatic show or the parrots whizzing past overhead to perch on a tree or the flocks of pigeon, the most sprightly and energetic of all birds, fly past swerving and displaying calisthenics of unparallel agility and dexterity have no appeal for them.

Indeed, like colour blind, people are increasingly becoming blind of natural sight although their eyes have no vision problem. Mechanical and robotic advantages are there but they have been robbed of the mental power for appreciation of beauty and aesthetics all around. In this concrete jungle of Dhaka, there is not much to see because the structures are impervious and discouraging to develop appreciation for the myriad blessings Nature presents before appreciative minds.

Yet the city is not totally devoid of some precious gifts. One has to be a little mindful to discover those. Right now the radiant luxuriant blossoms of Krisnachura and Radhachura under the scorching sun are indeed a sight to behold! If one passes by the Hatirjeel area, the red and yellow exuberance on these trees close by the flyover can make one's heart dance in joy. So plentiful are the flowers in their dazzling colours that they are sure to captivate both eyes and mind.

There are other flowers like Sonals which are in fact showers of gold on show. Jarul flowers, also found at this time, display a splash of violet and white. If these flowers cannot hold attention of people, it is their fault. It shows that the minds have been mortgaged to the devil of high performing devices and gadgets.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/environment/looking-for-small-bliss-all-around,2023-05-18 10:34:38,thefinancialexpress
768,Green cover can save Dhaka City from environmental disaster,"Two contrasting developments in the two city corporations! While the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) has taken up a programme of planting 200,000 saplings in two years, the Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) is felling trees on the Satmasjid road median in the name of infrastructure development and beautification. The DNCC mayor's objective is clear: when grown into trees, they will account for a significant green cover enough to keep the city's temperature low. On the other hand, the felling of trees on the road divider in Dhanmoni has drawn ire from the local people of the area as well as environmentalists.

The mayhem of the trees on Satmasjid Road started as early as January this year. Already the trees in the section between the Abahani playground and Jigatola have been denuded and a concrete median is replacing the earlier one. Now the environmental groups and locals have organised public protests against the felling of trees. But clearly, they are late in making their feeling known. This development project started in September, 2022 and the felling of trees began in the middle of January this year.

There should have been public protest against the mayhem right at that time. In fact, newspapers published reports on this so-called development and beautification programme. This scribe also focused on this issue, demanding abandonment of the mass extermination of trees on the median. Now that indigenous trees like banyan, neem and plum two decades old have been mowed down from the larger segment of the road, the protest, even if it is effective, cannot bring back those lost trees.

The DSCC chief engineer is, however, reported to have said that the median will be double the size with ample space for plantation of better quality trees. There is a provision for tree plantation on the median. If it happens, well and good. But shouldn't the DSCC consult with the local inhabitants or at least notify them through a public notice what it really intended to do?

Environmentalists and urban planners agree that the development work and beatification could be accomplished without bringing the trees down. Newly planted saplings will take years and decades to grow to maturity and will not replace those felled. By decimating a considerably mature tree, people do not only put an end to a life but also a milestone, a culture and history that carries a bond of familiarity, a heritage from one generation to another. This cultural association has no replacement.

Way back in 1981, this scribe was pleasantly surprised to see that at Chanayka Marg of New Delhi, the road planners had elongated some portion of the footpath in order to protect a tree which was well past its prime and showed signs of decline. In an earlier piece, this fact was mentioned. Similarly, the enviable green cover of Bangalore was also cited to point to the urgency of planting trees on every available roadside vacant space in this capital. The difference of 10 degree Celsius of temperature between the capital city's hotspots and a tree-covered rural site is indeed concerning enough. Then it should not escape discerning people's notice that in the Dhaka cantonment areas, the heat is much less than in the city proper. Again, there is a significant difference in temperatures between the Ramna area with tree covers and the commercial hubs with no greenery.

Dhaka city cannot instantly have primeval trees like those in the Lalbagh Garden and Cubbon Park in Bangalore but if the DNCC mayor's tree plantation programme becomes successful, one day the future generation will boast such natural guardians and protectors of environment. Under an agreement between the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation and the DNCC, the tree plantation programme will be carried out. Significantly, a chief heat officer has been appointed, first of its kind in Asia, aimed at cooling down the city's temperature.

The mayor of the north Dhaka has also revealed that after eviction of illegal land grabbers from the Lautola canal, 2,000 saplings have already been planted on its banks. These are the right moves to make Dhaka city cooler to a large degree. But both DNCC and DSCC can do more by planting trees in a planned way in order to turn the city's avenues aesthetically pleasing with rows of trees selected carefully. The New Town in Kolkata may be an example of how this can be done even in this part of the world.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/environment/green-cover-can-save-dhaka-city-from-environmental-disaster,2023-05-18 10:34:38,thefinancialexpress
769,How a small Caribbean island has become the world's first climate-resilient nation,"As the morning sun rose above the Kalinago Territory on the Caribbean island of Dominica in September 2017, Faustulus Frederick was putting the final touches to a traditional wooden sculpture at his home in the small village of Salybia.

Frederick, an artist and former Kalinago Chief, was finishing his latest masterpiece when an emergency alert blared on a nearby radio. The warning advised residents to prepare for an incoming storm that would intensify into Hurricane Maria, a category five superstorm that devastatingly hit the island.

The hurricane claimed lives and cost Dominica over 3.5 billion Eastern Caribbean Dollars, equivalent to 226 per cent of its GDP in 2016, in losses and damages, reported BBC. For Frederick and other residents of the Kalinago Territory, it was a particularly harsh blow. But it was also a wake-up call for the entire country.

Dominica, an island nation located in the Lesser Antilles, is considered one of the most vulnerable places on the planet regarding climate change. Despite this, the government has set an ambitious goal of becoming the world's first climate-resilient nation.

Dominica's prime minister recognised the island's vulnerability to climate change and declared that the country was 'on the front line of the war on climate change.' He announced plans to build resilience into every aspect of society and make Dominica 'the world's first climate-resilient nation.'

The ambitious plan aims to protect the island from future natural disasters and ensure it remains habitable for generations. For Frederick, who now resides in a shelter, it is a glimmer of hope in an otherwise uncertain future.

As Dominica works towards becoming a climate-resilient nation, the world will be watching to see if this small island nation can achieve what many consider an impossible feat.

Dominica's early warning system is an innovative approach to mainstreaming resilience that warns residents of dangerous weather events. The unique system includes a grassroots approach of support and communication using traditional conch shells.

Ilan Kelman, deputy director of the University College London (UCL) Warning Research Centre, the world's first research centre dedicated to the science of warnings, told BBC that warnings are essential for everyone as they support livelihoods, save lives, and make places habitable.

The challenge for small island developing states like Dominica is that they are disproportionately impacted by climate change, meaning they stand to lose more than other countries if the global community and big greenhouse gas emitters fail to meet commitments to cut emissions.

Dominica's unique system of early warnings is especially tricky due to its mountainous topography, which makes generating accurate extreme weather forecasts complex, particularly for floods, said Emily Wilkinson, a senior research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute, to BBC.

The early warning system starts with urgent official information at the national level, which is then trickled down through various stages until it reaches the community. The Kalinago council, the local governing authority led by the Kalinago chief, is at the heart of the system.

The emergency warning system receives information from the National Disaster Office, starts working with each hamlet head receiving instructions, and takes the information throughout the community. Each hamlet has five or six people trained in community emergency response.

The conch shells play a vital role in the intricate communication chain, providing important layers to reach people in more ways than warnings sent to smartphones.

The Caribbean island nation is now taking steps to become a model of climate resilience. Following the devastation caused by Tropical Storm Erika and Hurricane Maria, Dominica is building resilient infrastructure along with early warning systems to protect its coastal communities from flooding and storm surges.

The country has also embraced ecosystem restoration as a buffer against natural hazards, focusing on stabilising slopes and protecting vulnerable communities. The Climate Resilience Execution Agency of Dominica (Cread) has assessed the vulnerability of all communities in the country to different natural hazards and prioritised which communities are the most vulnerable and what kind of support they would need.

The government has also revised the building code to ensure that only homes and buildings that can withstand natural disasters are approved for construction.

Dominica's efforts to protect its citizens from climate change are urgent, and its success in this mission hinges on cooperation from people on many different levels. And most importantly, countries like Dominica need support from global communities to fight the uneven battle.

770,"As the climate suffers, enforcement needed for corporate green pledges","Pledges to slash climate-changing emissions to nearly zero now cover more than 90 per cent of the world's economy. But emissions themselves are still rising, despite scientists warning they must plunge by nearly half this decade to keep people safe.

Dealing with climate change through voluntary commitments, especially by businesses, ""has simply not worked"", noted Arianne Griffith, a lawyer and corporate accountability expert with advocacy group Global Witness.

New transparency and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure that corporations and governments meet their promises on climate action, she and others said this week at the Skoll World Forum, an expert gathering focused on solving global problems.

Griffith said those measures could include things like a European Union Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) - which Global Witness and its partners have pushed for since 2019 in Brussels, despite corporate opposition.

The directive would require firms to track and show how their businesses, and the products and services they produce, align with the Paris Agreement on climate change - or face civil lawsuits for the climate and human rights damage they cause.

""The idea is to create a credible threat of legal action for the companies that are threatening all of us with persistent inaction,"" Griffith said.

So far such legal pressure remains relatively rare, despite what experts described as widespread ""greenwashing"" by companies that make pledges - often for commercial gain - with few credible plans to meet them.

""We're in a tough spot when it comes to transparency and accountability,"" said Gillian Caldwell, chief climate officer for the US Agency for International Development.

Among national governments, Colombia is the only country that has enshrined in law its climate action plan developed under the Paris Agreement, giving the plan some level of enforceability, she noted.

Beyond that, governments are held to their climate commitments only by public opinion or pressure from countries they team up with in trade or other partnerships, she said.

""In most cases, there really is no accountability,"" Caldwell added.

She and other experts said genuinely reducing emissions in line with what scientists say is needed would require stronger steps, from new legal liability for climate harm to ensuring businesses that make net-zero claims cut their own emissions rather than just purchasing carbon offsets.

CURBING DEFORESTATION

In Brazil - the world's fifth biggest carbon polluter, largely due to loss of its forests - efforts to crack down on illegal deforestation are emerging using satellite data.

MapBiomas, a Brazilian non-profit, uses satellite maps that break the country into 9.6 billion parcels - each 30 by 30 metres (98 ft) - to show in fine detail where deforestation and other changes in land use are happening.

It then works with state governments, prosecutors and even the state-controlled Banco do Brasil to flag illegal land clearance and hold the culprits to account with consequences including fines, lawsuits and loan refusals.

Because banks provide about 80 per cent of the money needed to convert deforested land into cattle ranches or soy farms, choking off finance is an effective way to curb illegal activity, said Tasso Azevedo, MapBiomas founder and general coordinator.

The satellite mapping is also helping hold Brazil to account on its pledge to restore 12 million hectares (29.7 million acres) of degraded land, he said.

While the satellite maps show that 46 million hectares are in some state of regeneration, they also reveal that many replanted areas are rapidly being cleared again, which suggests that tracking tree-planting is no real measure of improvement.

By combining satellite maps with local knowledge, ""our job is to tell the story"" of each piece of land, Azevedo said.

MapBiomas is now expanding its work to Indonesia, another country struggling to lower forest loss, with plans for further expansion in the tropics, he added.

ROLE FOR COMMUNITIES

In many cases, communities can play a key role in holding governments to account, said Sonkita Conteh, a lawyer in Sierra Leone and co-founder of Namati, an organisation that uses legal networks to advance social and environmental justice.

Last year, Sierra Leone passed a customary land rights act that gives communities greater power over their collectively held land, making it harder for authorities to hand it out to loggers and other corporations.

Now if the government wants land to give to investors, it needs to gain consent from local people - a measure that should help cut runaway deforestation, Conteh said.

Griffith, of Global Witness, said new and more substantial consequences are required, to incentivise those who make green pledges to keep them.

771,Rising Antarctic ice melt will dramatically slow global ocean flows,"Rapidly melting Antarctic ice is dramatically slowing down the flow of water through the world's oceans, and could have a disastrous impact on global climate, the marine food chain and even the stability of ice shelves, new research has found.

The ""overturning circulation"" of the oceans, driven by the movement of denser water towards the sea floor, helps deliver heat, carbon, oxygen and vital nutrients around the globe.

But deep ocean water flows from the Antarctic could decline by 40% by 2050, according to a study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/environment/rising-antarctic-ice-melt-will-dramatically-slow-global-ocean-flows,2023-05-18 10:34:40,thefinancialexpress
772,UN votes to ask world court to rule on national climate obligations,"The United Nations General Assembly voted on Wednesday to pass a resolution asking the world's top court to define the obligations of states to combat climate change, a legal opinion that could drive countries to take stronger measures and clarify international law.

The historic resolution seeking an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice made it to the UN General Assembly after a four-year campaign led by the Republic of Vanuatu and was passed with a consensus vote. It was inspired by Pacific island law students who want the international legal system to deliver climate justice, reports Reuters.

Vanuatu Prime Minister Ishmael Kalsakau said the resolution and advisory opinion ""will have a powerful and positive impact on how we address climate change and protect present and future generations.""

""Together we will send a loud and clear message not only around the world but far into the future that on this very day, the people of the UN acting through their governments decided to leave aside differences and work together to tackle the defining challenge of our time,"" he said before the General Assembly.

An advisory opinion by the court, judicial organ of the UN, would not be binding in any jurisdiction, but could underpin future climate negotiations by clarifying financial obligations countries have on climate change, helping states revise and enhance national climate plans submitted to the Paris Agreement, as well as strengthening domestic policies and legislation.

""Such an opinion would assist the General Assembly, the UN and Member States to take the bolder and stronger climate action that our world so desperately needs,"" UN Secretary General António Guterres said on Wednesday.

The push for the resolution was driven by Vanuatu and a core group of 18 countries ranging from Costa Rica to Germany. On the eve of the vote, Vanuatu diplomats were still trying to win support from China and the US, or at least to convince the two biggest greenhouse gas emitting countries not to raise objections.

The latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, greenhouse gas emissions must be nearly halved by 2030.

Vanuatu and other vulnerable countries are already grappling with powerful impacts of a heating planet. The south Pacific island nation has been slammed by climate-fueled cyclones, including two category-four cyclones this month that left 10% of its population still in evacuation centers.

It could take the ICJ around 18 months to issue an advisory opinion, with countries submitting input over the next year.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/environment/un-votes-to-ask-world-court-to-rule-on-national-climate-obligations,2023-05-18 10:34:40,thefinancialexpress
773,Millions of dead fish wash up amid heat wave in Australia,"Millions of fish have washed up dead in southeastern Australia in a die-off that authorities and scientists say is caused by depleted oxygen levels in the river after recent floods and hot weather.

Residents of the Outback town of Menindee in New South Wales state complained of a terrible smell from the dead fish, reports AP.

“The stink was terrible. I nearly had to put a mask on,” said local nature photographer Geoff Looney.

“I was worried about my own health. That water right in the top comes down to our pumping station for the town. People north of Menindee say there’s cod and perch floating down the river everywhere,” he said.

The Department of Primary Industries said the fish deaths were likely caused by low oxygen levels as floods recede, a situation made worse by fish needing more oxygen because of the warmer weather.

Police have established an emergency operations centre in Menindee to coordinate a massive cleanup this week.

State Emergency Operations Controller Peter Thurtell said the immediate focus was to provide a clean water supply to residents.

“There is no need for community concern as the initial assessment has determined multiple viable solutions to maintain water supply to the Menindee township and surrounds,” he said.

State agencies also started to release higher-quality water where possible to boost dissolved oxygen levels in the area.

“We’ve just sort of started to clean up, and then this has happened, and that’s sort of you’re walking around in a dried-up mess and then you’re smelling this putrid smell. It’s a terrible smell and horrible to see all those dead fish,” said Jan Dening, a Menindee resident.

Mass fish kills have been reported on the Darling-Baaka River in recent weeks. Tens of thousands of fish were found at the same spot in late February, while there have been several reports of dead fish downstream toward Pooncarie, near the borders of South Australia and Victoria states.

Enormous fish kills occurred on the river at Menindee during severe drought conditions in late 2018 and early 2019, with locals estimating millions of deaths.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/environment/millions-of-dead-fish-wash-up-amid-heat-wave-in-australia,2023-05-18 10:34:41,thefinancialexpress
774,Chad replaces Bangladesh as worst among countries,"Lahore in Pakistan jumped more than 10 places to become the city with the worst air in the world in 2022, according to an annual global survey by a Swiss maker of air purifiers.

Reuters says the report published on Tuesday by IQAir also said that Chad in central Africa had replaced Bangladesh as the country with the most polluted air last year.

IQAir measures air quality levels based on the concentration of lung-damaging airborne particles known as PM2.5. Its annual survey is widely cited by researchers and government organisations.

Lahore's air quality worsened to 97.4 micrograms of PM2.5 particles per cubic meter from 86.5 in 2021, making it the most polluted city globally.

Hotan, the only Chinese city in the top 20, followed Lahore with PM2.5 levels of 94.3, an improvement from 101.5 in 2021.

The next two cities in the rankings were Indian: Bhiwadi, on Delhi's outskirts had pollution levels at 92.7, and Delhi followed close behind at 92.6.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a maximum PM2.5 concentration of 5 micrograms per cubic meter.

While Chad had an average level of 89.7, Iraq, which had the second most polluted air for a country, averaged 80.1.

Pakistan, which had two of the five cities with the worst air in 2022, stood third in the country-wide ranking at 70.9, followed by Bahrain at 66.6.

Bangladesh's air quality improved from 2021, when it was tagged as the country with the worst air. It is ranked fifth in the latest report, with PM2.5 levels coming down to 65.8 from 76.9.

India has has some of the most polluted cities in the world, but ranked eighth in the latest report, with PM2.5 levels at 53.3.

The report said India and Pakistan experienced the worst air quality in the Central and South Asian region, where nearly 60 per cent of the population lives in areas where the concentration of PM2.5 particles is at least seven times higher than WHO's recommended levels.

It said one in 10 people globally were living in an area where air pollution poses a threat to health.

The US Pacific territory Guam had cleaner air than any country, with a PM2.5 concentration of 1.3, while Canberra had the cleanest air for a capital city, with 2.8.

The index was prepared using data from more than 30,000 air quality monitors in more than 7,300 locations in 131 countries, territories and regions.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/environment/chad-replaces-bangladesh-as-worst-among-countries,2023-05-18 10:34:41,thefinancialexpress
775,More than 100 countries complete UN treaty to protect high seas,"Negotiators from more than 100 countries completed a UN treaty to protect the high seas on Saturday, a long-awaited step that environmental groups say will help reverse marine biodiversity losses and ensure sustainable development.

According to Reuters, the legally binding pact to conserve and ensure the sustainable use of ocean biodiversity, under discussion for 15 years, was finally agreed after five rounds of protracted UN-led negotiations that ended in New York on Saturday, a day after the original deadline.

""The ship has reached the shore,"" the UN conference president, Rena Lee, said after a marathon final day of talks.

The treaty is seen as a crucial component in global efforts to bring 30 per cent of the world's land and sea under protection by the end of the decade, a target known as ""30 by 30"" agreed in Montreal in December.

Economic interests were a major sticking point throughout the latest round of negotiations, which began on Feb. 20, with developing countries calling for a greater share of the spoils from the ""blue economy"", including the transfer of technology.

An agreement to share the benefits of ""marine genetic resources"" used in industries like biotechnology also remained an area of contention until the end, dragging out talks.

Greenpeace says 11 million square km (4.2 million square miles) of ocean needs to be put under protection every year until 2030 to meet the target.

Very little of the high seas is subject to any protection, with pollution, acidification and overfishing posing a growing threat.

""Countries must formally adopt the treaty and ratify it as quickly as possible to bring it into force, and then deliver the fully protected ocean sanctuaries our planet needs,"" said Laura Meller, a Greenpeace oceans campaigner who attended the talks.

777,DMTCL set to start MRT-5 North depot development work,"The Dhaka metro rail company is scheduled to sign a contract on land development work of MRT-5 North depot with a Japan-Bangladesh joint venture company on May 23.

It would be the first contract to start construction of the Hemayetpur-Vatara metro rail line that is planned to go through Gabtoli, Mirpur and Gulshan.

Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited (DMTCL) selected the TOA Corporation of Japan and Spectra Group of Bangladesh for the land development work of the depot at Hamayetpur.

Officials said the JV would work on soil improvement and land development of 99.25 acres of land at a cost of Tk11.89 billion, including customs duty and value-added tax.

The DMTCL selected the contractor nearly 11 months after the tender was opened on June 27 last year.

Project Director Aftab Uddin Ahmed said that though 19 tender documents were sold, only three companies participated in the bid.

The MRT 5 North line will be a 20-kilometre one and is expected to complete by 2028. It would have both elevated and underground sections with 14 stations to be developed at an estimated cost of Tk 412.39 billion.

According to the project document, the elevated 5.6km will start from Hemayetpur to Aminbazar and the 13.5km underground section will start from Gabtoli to Natunbazar. It will connect with MRT 1 through an interchange.

Like two other MRTs, the Japan International Cooperation Agency will provide a financial assistance of Tk 290 billion for the project.

778,Spice market heats up way too early,"In keeping with the soaring trajectory of nearly all essential commodities, the prices of aromatic spices, commonly referred to as 'garam masala', have also witnessed a remarkable upsurge well ahead of the Eid-ul-Azha festival.

Cumin seeds have skyrocketed to Tk 800-900 per kilogram this week, surpassing all previous records.

A week ago, the spice was at Tk 700-750 per kilogram, whereas the current prices are nearly 100 per cent higher than those of a year ago, according to the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).

Clove and cinnamon have also experienced a substantial 8-10 per cent surge within a week, with their current prices standing at 40 per cent and 15 per cent higher respectively, compared to the corresponding period last year.

Cardamom prices have exhibited an 8-9 per cent increase in just a week, aligning with the price recorded last year.

Meanwhile, coriander seed prices have surged to Tk 260 per kilogram this week, marking an astonishing 50 per cent hike in a mere seven days, according to the TCB.

Usually, the prices of garam masala rise prior to the Eid-ul-Azha festival. However, this time, rates of such spices have surged much earlier, considering that the sacrificial festival is still one and a half months away.

Juel Rana, a grocer in Dhaka's West Dhanmondi area, reported significant increases in the prices of locally grown spices such as onion, ginger, garlic, and imported ingredients of garam masala at the Moulovibazar wholesale market.

He said cumin experienced the highest price hike during this period.

Swapan Ghosh, a trader based in Chattogram, said that all garam masala items saw an increase of Tk 60-200 per kilogram in Chaktai-Khatunganj due to lower imports.

He said that cumin, in particular, was being wholesaled at Tk 760-780 per kilogram at Khatunganj.

Meanwhile, the price of onions rose by an additional Tk 5 per kilogram and was being sold at Tk 70-80 per kilogram on Wednesday.

Ginger was being sold at its previous high of Tk 300-380 per kilogram, while garlic was at Tk 160-180 per kilogram. Green chillies remained stable at its previous high of Tk 180-220 per kilogram.

779,Don’t use sugar substitutes for weight control: WHO,"The use of sugar substitutes or artificial sweeteners does not confer any long-term benefit in reducing body fat in adults or children, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization.

“Replacing free sugars with non-sugar sweeteners does not help people control their weight long-term,” said Francesco Branca, director of WHO’s department of nutrition and food safety. “We did see a mild reduction of body weight in the short term, but it’s not going to be sustained.”

Branca said the guidance applies to all people except those with pre-existing diabetes as none of the studies in the review included people with diabetes, and an assessment could not be made, reports CNN.

The review also indicated that there might be ‘potential undesirable effects’ from the long-term use of sugar substitutes such as a mildly increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

Non-sugar sweeteners are widely used as an ingredient in pre-packaged foods and beverages and are also sometimes added to food and drinks directly by consumers.

WHO issued guidelines on sugar intake in 2015, recommending that adults and children reduce their daily intake of free sugars to less than 10 per cent of their total energy intake. Following that recommendation, interest in sugar alternatives intensified, the review said.

“This new guideline is based on a thorough assessment of the latest scientific literature, and it emphasises that the use of artificial sweeteners is not a good strategy for achieving weight loss by reducing dietary energy intake,” said nutrition researcher Ian Johnson, emeritus fellow at Quadram Institute Bioscience, formerly the Institute of Food Research, in Norwich, United Kingdom.

“However, this should not be interpreted as an indication that sugar intake has no relevance to weight-control,” Johnson said in a statement.

Instead, one should cut back on using sugar-sweetened drinks, and try to use “raw or lightly processed fruit as a source of sweetness,” Johnson added.

Dr. Keith Ayoob, scientific adviser for the Calorie Control Council, an international association representing the low-calorie food and beverage industry, told CNN via email the WHO’s “insistence on focusing only on prevention of unhealthy ‎weight gain and non-communicable diseases is at the very least, misguided.”

Robert Rankin, president of the Calorie Control Council, said “low- and no-calorie sweeteners are a critical tool that can help consumers manage body weight and reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases.”

The guidance is meant for government health organizations in countries who may wish to use the scientific analysis to implement policy changes for their citizens, Branca said.

“That will likely depend on the way that which sweeteners are consumed in a specific country,” he said. “For example, in a country where consumption patterns are high, those countries might decide to take action in a way or another.”",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/health/dont-use-sugar-substitutes-for-weight-control-who,2023-05-18 10:34:43,thefinancialexpress

781,Sleep is vital for every bodily function,"Sleeping is a biological process set to consume almost one-third of our lifetime and for a good reason. Sleep is critical for good health, which is why all beings, not just humans, need it.

Sleep is linked to many bodily functions. It is important to ensure the brain functions properly, our appetite and metabolism are working well, and all systems, including cardiovascular, immune and hormonal systems, are good to go. Sleeping well alone cannot guarantee optimal health, but it is an important factor.

According to sleep expert Dr Michael Twery of the National Institute of Health, sleep affects every body tissue. Our hormones, blood pressure, heart, brain, immunity -- everything is connected with sleep. Another sleep expert and neuroscientist from the same organisation, Dr Merrill Mitler, argued that we could see the difference if we compare well-rested people and people with a lack of sleep. ""They're operating at a different level than people trying to get by on 1 or 2 hours less nightly sleep,"" he summed it up.

Our body tissues go through daily wear and tear. Sleep is the time when the body attempts to repair those. Important functions, e.g., muscle growth and protein synthesis, mostly occur during sleep. Without such restorative functions, our bodies will age dramatically quickly.

Not only that but sleep also allows the brain to clean up debris and other unnecessary materials from the central nervous system. Otherwise, there would be a serious detrimental impact on our cognitive abilities.

After an injury or disease, rest is often part of the prescription because it speeds up the healing process. Our immune functions are boosted by sleep. A lot of research bore evidence that the immunity from flu-vaccine is stronger in well-rested people than those with inadequate sleep.

Exercise a lot? Great, but sleep is essential if we want to reap the benefits of that. Unless we combine our exercise with adequate sleep, it won't help our bodies.

How can we define adequate or healthy sleep? It must be of sufficient duration, preferably 6-8 hours for adults. The quality should be good; it must follow a regular routine and maintain appropriate sleep hygiene. If sleep fails to fulfil these criteria, there may be an adverse impact on many body processes, like stress response, metabolism, brain functions and so on.

Lack of sleep can cause short- and long-term problems. Depressed mood, emotional imbalance, poor memory and performance etc., are the short-term impact. In the long run, sleep disturbances are linked with the development of dyslipidemia, heart disease, hypertension, obesity and even diabetes.

So, what do we do? We need to ensure that sleep is not neglected, and we are not deprioritising it for something else unless absolutely necessary. Even then, we should have a plan to compensate for that. For a productive and healthy life, the importance of a good night's sleep cannot be overstated.

783,18 more dengue patients hospitalised in 24 hrs,"Eighteen more patients were hospitalised with dengue in the 24 hours till Monday morning.

Of the new patients, sixteen were admitted to hospitals in Dhaka and the rest outside it, according to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).

Ninety-three dengue patients, including 73 in the capital, are now receiving treatment at hospitals across the country.

So far, the DGHS has recorded 1261 dengue cases, 1156 recoveries, and twelve deaths this year.

784,The reemerging problem of Leprosy in Bangladesh,"Let's start with the story of a 47-year-old female tea-picker of Sylhet. She developed small patches of discolouration on her left hand. She only paid attention to it when her fingers became stiff, and her livelihood was affected as tea picking became a struggle.

This was a blow to the middle-aged lady whose whole family depended on her income. She had to consult with a physician and received news that she got leprosy. Her nerves on the left were damaged beyond repair, but the doctors could cure her of the disease with the available treatment.

Leprosy is a disease we all probably have heard of. It is caused by bacteria, hence infectious. The affected areas include skin, nerves, respiratory system and sometimes the eyes and the ears.

Usual manifestations are flat discoloured spots on the skin, thick or dry patches, and ulceration or swelling in the earlobes or face.

Eventually, the affected areas become numb without sensation. Diagnosis is confirmed by identifying the bacteria in the skin sample.

The good news is a 100% cure is possible with proper treatment. There are lingering physical deformities and persistent social stigma against the patient in some cases.

World Health Organization (WHO) declared in 2000 that leprosy is no longer a public health problem, probably that came a little too soon.

Leprosy is still prevalent in over 120 countries, and in many parts of the world, the cases are rising, especially in south-east Asia. WHO now calls leprosy a neglected tropical disease or NTD, since following the WHO declaration, many countries shifted their resources elsewhere from tackling leprosy.

The same applies to Bangladesh. Here, WHO declared leprosy eliminated in 1998. Elimination did not mean zero incidences but rather a small number of them. However, concern was raised about hidden cases.

Now, WHO identifies Bangladesh as the country with the fifth-highest number of cases globally; many challenges were highlighted, including continuous transmission, delay in diagnosis and inefficiency in the health care system to manage the issue.

UN has appointed a special rapporteur for leprosy. The rapporteur, Alice Cruz, visited Bangladesh recently and warned about the possibility of a large number of undiagnosed cases of Leprosy.

Leprosy Mission, a charity working in Africa and Asia, pinpointed the tea gardens as a hotbed of leprosy, attributing it to those areas' overcrowded and poor living conditions.

According to their local medical officer in Sylhet, Dr Benjamin Rozario, they are observing an unprecedented rise in cases. This region probably has one of the highest leprosy rates worldwide.

One of the district mayors of the Sylhet region argued that funding has dried up since the WHO declaration in 1998.

However, a strategy titled 'Post Elimination National Leprosy Control Strategy 2011 – 2015' has been rolled out. Allocating sufficient resources and identifying specific, measurable targets are necessary to make it successful. We have already beaten leprosy once; there is no reason we could not do it again.

786,G7 nations plan new vaccine programme for developing countries,"The Group of Seven (G7) rich nations plan to establish a new programme to distribute vaccines to developing countries at next week's summit of leaders, according to a Reuters report that cited Japan's Yomiuri newspaper on Saturday.

In addition to the G7, G20 nations such as India and international groups such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank will participate, it added, citing Japanese government sources.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the COVAX facility, backed by WHO and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), delivered nearly 2 billion doses of coronavirus vaccine to emerging countries.

However, COVAX faced setbacks in ensuring equitable access, as wealthy nations prioritised shots for their citizens while insufficient storage facilities in poorer nations caused supply delays and disposal of millions of close-to-expiry doses.

The new programme aims to pool rainy-day funds for vaccine production and purchases, as well as investment in low-temperature storages and training of health workers to prepare for the next global pandemic, the paper said.

Japan, this year's chair of the G7 meetings, looks to build support from emerging nations on wide-ranging issues such as supply chains, food security and climate change to counter the growing influence of China and Russia.

Saturday's meeting of G7 finance ministers agreed to offer aid to low- and middle-income countries to help increase their role in supply chains for energy-related products.

The G7 grouping of Britain, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, is considering whether to issue a statement on global pandemic response at the May 19-21 summit in Japan's city of Hiroshima, the Yomiuri said.

Details of the new vaccine programme are to be discussed at the G20 Summit in India in September, it added.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/health/g7-nations-plan-new-vaccine-programme-for-developing-countries,2023-05-18 10:34:46,thefinancialexpress
787,Physicians find meditation’s impact on health cost cuts,"The country's renowned physicians have welcomed the government's initiative to include meditation in the medical treatment as an alternative treatment and opined that its long term reflection is likely in reduction of health expenditure of the country, says a press release.

They also called upon the authorities concerned to include meditation in both education and medical curriculum to help people lead a healthy life.

The physicians were sharing their views during a scientific seminar on 'Inclusion of meditation as alternative treatment: our responsibility'' organised by Quantum Foundation at IDEB Bhaban in Dhaka on Friday.

National Professor Dr Shahla Khatun attended the seminar as chief guest while former Dean of the Faculty of Basic Science and Paraclinical Science of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) Professor Dr M Iqbal Arslan and founder Chairman of Palliative Care Department in BSMMU Professor Dr Nizamuddin Ahmed as special guests.

Chaired by renowned mental health specialist and writer Anwara Syed Haq, the seminar was attended by around 400 physicians of public and private hospitals.

Quantum Heart Club Coordinator Dr Muniruzzaman presented the keynote paper in the seminar.

The guests also unveiled a magazine titled 'Meditation in physicians' prescription'.

The National Professor said gradual improvement in medical science finds the possibility of gene regulation and expressed her view that meditation can help in this connection.

Dr M Iqbal Arslan highlighted the impact of meditation on the health economy and said the government's significant budget spending for health could be reduced through practicing meditation.

In this connection the former dean said inclusion of meditation in social science education curriculum can help the young generation to lead a healthy life from an early stage.

The speakers also considered the Health Directorate's decision to include meditation part of health service a timely and epoch-making one.

The speakers said meditation is now recognised as part of health service worldwide because of its proven roles in healing, preventing and relieving diseases including stress, anxiety, insomnia, and high blood pressure.

According to scientists, meditation is an exercise of the brain as it works to reorganise, active, and lively the brain just like jogging does in increasing muscle strength and swimming in the biceps strength.

The special guests also expressed the belief that yoga and meditation play an effective role in becoming fit physically, mentally, socially and spiritually.

The Ministry of Health and Family Planning took meditation into account as alternative treatment to problems like hypertension, depression, stress, insomnia, high blood pressure, heart and stroke related complications during last December.

The Directorate of Health has already directed concerned departments through an official letter recently to take measures for creating awareness to all concerned.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/health/physicians-find-meditations-impact-on-health-cost-reduction,2023-05-18 10:34:47,thefinancialexpress

789,Six cos under extended credit facility aimed at reenergising market,"Only six companies fall under the extended coverage of credit facility that has recently been revised to boost liquidity flow into stocks.

The move is expected to give new momentum to the sluggish markets.

The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) has issued an order allowing margin loans for investment in companies with price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio greater than 40 but below 50.

Earlier, the credit facility was limited to companies with P/E ratio of 40 and under.

The newly-included marginable stocks must have minimum paid-up capital of Tk 300 million and must have been listed under category 'A' for the last three years.

The companies that get the extended loan coverage are Bangladesh Steel Re-Rolling Mills, Saif Powertec, aamra technologies, Fortune Shoes, United Insurance Company, and S. Alam Cold Rolled Steels.

Their paid-up capital is between Tk 647 million and Tk 3.79 billion where the P/E ratio ranges between 40.66 and 49.7.

Only Bangladesh Steel Re-Rolling Mills (BSRM) has foreign investors who own 17.29 per cent shares of the company.

Among the companies, aamra technologies has swung on the Dhaka Stock Exchange for the last two years without getting stuck at floor.

Its share price more than doubled to Tk 56.90 between the third week of May 2021 and the first week of November last year.

Later, the stock slid to Tk 39 by November last year. It closed at Tk 37.30 on Wednesday. The company's EPS rose to Tk 1.78 in FY22, riding on cost effective operations.

BSRM with a paid-up capital of Tk 2.99 billion has been an 'A' category stock since 2018 and distributed dividends between 15-35 per cent.

The stock has been languishing at the floor price of Tk 90 since the end of October last year. Its P/E ratio remained at 40.66.

BSRM displayed a remarkable growth in profit in FY21. Its EPS rose to Tk 18.96 in FY21 from Tk 3.90 a year ago. Then EPS dropped to Tk 10.34 in FY22 due to reduced sales caused by inflation, costlier raw materials and devaluation of the local currency.

The paid-up capital of Fortune Shoes is Tk 1.71 billion and the company has been in 'A' category since 2022 distributing 10-15 percent dividends to its shareholders.

The shoe maker has been stuck at the floor price of Tk 75.70 since December 22, last year. Its P/E ratio is 46.16.

The company saw a significant growth in income in FY22 compared to the previous fiscal year. Its EPS jumped more than 50 per cent from FY21 to FY22.

Another company Saif Powertec has been in the 'A' category since 2014 distributing dividends between 10-33 per cent.

Its share price has not moved from the floor price of Tk 30.40 since November 9, last year except for in one session on January 17. Its P/E ratio stands at 43.68.

United Insurance Company with a paid-up capital of Tk 3.79 million has been in 'A' category since 2014. It has paid out dividends between 10-33 per cent. The company gave higher amounts of stock dividend than cash dividend for many years.

The stock has remained static at Tk 29.70 since November 10, 2022. Hence P/E ratio too remained unchanged at 43.68.

If the companies' recent quarterly growth performance is considered, BSRM performed best in January-March this year. It overcame loss of the previous two quarters.

The company's nine-month consolidated profit was Tk 495 million whereas it incurred a loss of Tk 1.10 billion in the first two quarters.

Aamra technologies saw a year-on-year marginal decline in profit to Tk 10.35 million in the third quarter of FY23 because of a fall in revenue and increase in financial expenses.

Fortune Shoes observed an 80 per cent year-on year fall in profit to Tk 15.36 million in the latest quarter.

Saif Powertec has not yet released its financial reports for January-March, FY23.

United Insurance saw a 29 per cent year-on-year decline in EPS to Tk 0.22 in the quarter ended in March this year.

The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) has included S. Alam Cold Rolled Steels in the list of marginable securities under the revised criteria though it has been downgraded to category B for giving less than 10 per cent dividend for FY22.

The company's paid-up capital is Tk 983.71 million and P/E ratio is 49.7.

Spokesperson of the securities regulator Mohammad Rezaul Karim said that to be considered as marginable a company must secure its position in 'A' category at present having met the other requirements.

790,"UN expert says Russia, China sending deadly aid to Myanmar's military","Myanmar’s military has imported at least $1 billion in arms and other material since it staged a coup in February 2021, a UN expert said on Wednesday in a new report that calls out Russia and China for aiding the junta's deadly campaign to crush its opposition, reports Reuters.

Since the military seized power and jailed democratic leaders, some opponents of military rule have taken up arms, in places joining ethnic minority insurgents, and the military has responded with air strikes and heavy weapons, including in civilian areas.

Russian-made Mi-35 helicopter, MiG-29 fighter jets and Yak-130 light aircraft, and Chinese K-8 jets, have been most frequently used to conduct air strikes that have hit schools, medical facilities, homes and other civilian sites, said the report by Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar.

In a single attack on a village gathering organized by the military's opponents in Sagaing region on April 11, two bombs dropped from a Yak-130 killed at least 160 people, reportedly including nearly 40 children, the report said.

Myanmar’s military says it is targeting insurgents and after the Sagaing attack said any civilians killed were probably supporters of opponents it calls ""terrorists.""

“The good news is we now know who is supplying these arms and the jurisdictions in which they operate,” Andrews said in a statement, calling for UN members to “step up and stop the flow of arms” with a complete ban on the arms transfers to Myanmar’s military, enforcement of existing bans and coordinated sanctions.

The UN expert used trade data to detail transfers of arms and other goods, including raw materials for Myanmar’s domestic arms production, to the military since the coup worth $406 million from Russia and $267 million from China, including from state-owned entities in both countries.

State-owned entities in India also made a smaller volume of transfers, and companies in Singapore, India and Thailand were also involved in transfers to the military.

Some $227 million of material came from Rosoboronexport, Moscow’s state-owned arms exporter, which has transferred SU-30 fighter jets, supplies for MiG-29 jets and rocket launch systems to Myanmar, the report said.

Other Russian companies provided a range of tools, equipment and spare parts for Russian-supplied weapons systems, it said.

“Weaponry provided by Russian suppliers has been used to commit probable war crimes and crimes against humanity in Myanmar,” the report said.

The UN missions of the five countries mentioned in the report as sources of arms and material did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

At a news conference in New York, Andrews said Chinese officials had earlier criticized his reporting, saying he was vilifying legitimate trade in arms and operating outside his mandate by conducting analysis. Russian officials had expressed a similar response, Andrews said.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/world/un-expert-says-russia-china-sending-deadly-aid-to-myanmars-military,2023-05-18 10:34:48,thefinancialexpress

792,Nagad Finance PLC gets NBFI licence,"Nagad Finance PLC has received a licence from the Bangladesh Bank (BB) to operate as a new non-bank financial institution (NBFI) in the country, according to a circular issued by the central bank.

Nagad Finance PLC is a strategic business unit of Bangladesh Post Office's digital financial service provider.

The order, signed on Wednesday by BB Deputy Governor Ahmed Jamal, said that Nagad Finance PLC has been permitted to engage in financing business in Bangladesh.

However, Nagad Finance PLC is a separate organisation in which the Bangladesh Post Office has no stake, as it did not have equity participation.

Meanwhile, it has been learned that the new NBFI may commence operations on July 1 this year. Earlier, the BB Board approved Nagad as an NBFI.

Non-Bank Financial Institutions (FIs) are financial institutions regulated under the Financial Institution Act-1993 and controlled by the Bangladesh Bank. Currently, 35 FIs are operating in Bangladesh.

The paid-up capital of the NBFI is Tk 1.0 billion, with an authorised capital of Tk 5.0 billion.

Previously, the BB board issued a letter of intent against Nagad Finance PLC.

Muhammad Farid Khan, vice-chairman of Summit Group, will serve as the chairman of the NBFI, which will be headquartered in the city's Banani area on Kamal Ataturk Road.

Mr Tanvir A Mishuk, managing director of Nagad, is also a director of the proposed NBFI.

However, Nagad Finance PLC will promote its products and services through Nagad Limited.

Together, Nagad Finance PLC and Nagad Limited will work to bring the underserved into the fold of digital financial inclusion. Nagad has been operating under a temporary MFS licence since 2019 through a service agreement with the Bangladesh Post Office. The relationship between Nagad and the Post Office is solely based on revenue sharing under the service agreement.

793,Budget FY24: Electricity may eat up one-third of subsidies,"Jacking up electricity subsidy, particularly as power generation in private plants remains expensive, is set to swell the overall amount of fiscal incentives in the forthcoming national budget, officials said.

The government is likely to allocate nearly Tk 320 billion in subsidy for the power sector in the fiscal year (FY) 2023-24 national budget, nearly 39-percent higher than in the revised budget for the current fiscal, Ministry of Finance (MoF) officials told the FE Wednesday.

The total subsidy in the upcoming budget might come to Tk 1.10 trillion-Tk120 billion higher than the current fiscal's revised outlay on this head.

In the original budget's subsidy figure for the current FY2023 was Tk 814.90 billion, which was recently revised upward to Tk 980 billion.

Meanwhile, the government is set to propose in parliament a Tk 7.64 trillion worth of national budget for the upcoming fiscal on June 01.

""As the US dollar price has increased a lot over the year and there are some previous pending payments on capacity charges to the private-sector local and International Power Producers (IPPs), we need an increased amount of power subsidy in the next fiscal,"" says a senior MoF official.

The state-run Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) needs more money to pay off previous dues to the IPPS and power producers as it purchased electricity from them, he adds.

Meanwhile, the government has increased the power price at consumer level thrice in recent past, which has eased the pressure on the fiscal support from the government.

However, the arrears in last fiscal year's (FY2022) subsidy have prompted the government to boost the total subsidy by nearly 39 per cent in the next budget, MoF officials said.

They said the subsidies on agriculture, stimulus and other fiscal benefits for others are also likely to be increased in the next national budget.

In the agriculture sector, the subsidy may be increased to nearly Tk270 billion as the ministry has demanded higher funds for paying arrears and minimising the gap between fertiliser import and consumer-level prices.

A total of Tk160 billion was allocated as agriculture subsidy in the budget for the current FY2023. In the revised budget, the allocation was ramped up to Tk260 billion as the fertilizer price on the international market remained volatile.

In the budget for the last FY2022, there was an allocation of Tk91 billion for subsidies in agriculture.

Meanwhile, the government has already decided to increase the prices of all types of fertilisers by Tk5.0 per kg, which will save some Tk70 billion in its marketing.

MoF officials said the post-Covid impact and the Ukraine-Russia war affected the global market prices of fuel oils, fertilisers, food products and gas, resulting in the augmenting of overall subsidy demand by various ministries for the next budget.

Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has suggested that the government cut its subsidy on energy, agriculture and all other sectors to maintain fiscal discipline as Bangladesh is going to graduate from its LDC status to a developing nation in 2026.

""Although the last IMF mission has already raised questions on the extended subsidy allocation in the next budget, but we have no option at this moment to cut it drastically overnight,"" another senior MoF official told the FE.

""We will be reducing our subsidy gradually which would also minimize pressure on the country's fiscal discipline.""

The MoF officials said in the current fiscal budget, about Tk60 billion was allocated for food subsidy, and in the revised budget, an additional allocation of Tk8.12 billion.

An allocation of Tk80 billion has been estimated for subsidizing food in the upcoming FY2024, they said.

794,NBR tasked to collect Tk 4.30t,"An 'ambitious' revenue target set for the next budget prompts the government to estimate 36 per cent of the domestic revenues to be realized from direct taxes, hugely banking on import duties.

For the upcoming financial year (FY) 2023-24, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has set Tk 4.30 trillion as revenue-collection target for the National Board of Revenue (NBR).

Of the target, Tk 1.54 trillion is set to be collected by the direct-tax wing while Tk 1.16 trillion by the customs wing of the revenue board.

However, the highest is earmarked to be mobilized by the value-added tax (VAT) wing, amounting to Tk 1.59 trillion.

Target for income tax has been set at Tk 1.22 trillion while it is Tk 1.36 trillion for VAT and import taxes Tk 1.11 trillion in FY 23.

The government is set to propose in parliament a Tk 7.64 trillion worth of national budget for the upcoming fiscal on June 01.

Officials say the tax-revenue target has been set ""ambitiously, as usual, like in previous years despite having limited scope to achieve it"".

A senior NBR official says the board may not offer any gross exemption to any sector as it needs to mobilize domestic revenue to meet the target advised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The IMF has recommended for the NBR to increase the country's tax-GDP ratio by 0.5 each percentage point in FY 23 and FY 24 and 0.7 percentage point by FY 25.

Projections by two leading think-tanks signal high revenue shortfalls in the current fiscal. The Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) and PRI earlier estimated that the NBR might face a shortfall against tax-revenue collection worth Tk 750 billion and Tk 546 billion respectively in the current fiscal year.

According to data available with Finance Division under the MoF, the government's tax-revenue collection was Tk 2.87 trillion in the last FY against its target for Tk 3.30 trillion. In the current FY, the NBR will have to collect Tk 3.70 trillion in tax revenue until June 30, 2023.

With the projected shortfalls in CPD and PRI calculations, the NBR will have to achieve over 32-percent growth in tax-revenue collection in the upcoming fiscal year to reach the Tk 4.30-trillion target.

Domestic tax-revenue collection had faced a shortfall worth Tk 375.33 billion until April against its target.

In the July-April period, the NBR achieved 5.90-percent growth over the corresponding period last year, according to provisional NBR data.

Revenue-collection growth was 12 per cent on average during the last five years.

The NBR collected Tk 2.47 trillion in tax revenue in July-April period against its target for Tk 2.84 trillion.

The board will have to collect Tk 1.22 trillion in revenue in May and June, Tk 613.03 billion per month, to achieve the target Tk 3.70 trillion set for this year.

Dr Ahsan H Mansur, Executive Director of the Policy Research Institute (PRI), predicts ""it's not possible to achieve the ambitious growth"" in tax-revenue collection since no reforms have been carried out for a long time.

""The government should set a realistic tax-revenue-collection target on the basis of actual tax-revenue collection. Fixing target setting growth on budget to budget should be avoided,"" he suggests.

During the last 12 years, the NBR had achieved tax-revenue-collection target once only, he said.

""Efficiencies of tax administration have also deteriorated over time. Tax-GDP ratio is declining while revenue-collection growth has also witnessed a sluggish trend,"" he adds.

According to the PRI's Study Center for Domestic Resource Mobilisation, tax-GDP ratio declined to 7.4 per cent in FY 2023 from 7.9 per cent last year.

795,Helmets cannot be marketed without BSTI nod: Home Minister,"Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said on Wednesday that no helmet can be marketed without the certification of the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI).

The minister said: “Bike riders are often involved in accidents. Statistics show that more motorcycles are involved in accidents than buses and trucks. That's why we want to ensure the quality of the helmets of the drivers and riders.”

“We have decided that helmets -- made at home or imported-- will only be marketed after the certification of the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI).

He made this remarks in a press conference after a meeting of a task force formed to strengthen discipline in the road transport sector and control accidents.

Drawing attention to the fact that BRTA is already conducting drives against unauthorised helmets, the minister said, ""We are taking steps to implement it better.""

Permission must be obtained before marketing, he added.

During his speech, the minister said service charges or donations cannot be collected from any place except terminals.

“Charges, tolls, and fees cannot be collected anywhere other than the city corporation's designated terminals,” he said. “In other districts without a city corporation, these service fees may be collected at locations designated by the municipality or deputy commissioner.”

The minister warned of legal consequences against those who extort money from people on the roads.

He also said those who want to set up driving training schools will require a BRTA licence.

“The ones that are currently operational will be monitored by BRTA. They can continue running those training schools only after getting the approval,” he said.

The minister said it has been recommended to increase the manpower of the police to bring discipline in the road transport sector.

Transport sector leader Shajahan Khan MP, Public Security Secretary Mostafizur Rahman, Road Transport and Highways Division Secretary ABM Aminullah Noori, IGP Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, Bangladesh Road Transport Owners Association President Mashiur Rahman Ranga and Secretary General Khandaker Enayet Ullah were present at the meeting.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/trade/helmets-cannot-be-marketed-without-bsti-nod-home-minister,2023-05-18 10:34:50,thefinancialexpress

801,"RoK to employ 10,000 more BD workers this year","The Republic of Korea (RoK) was the biggest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) for Bangladesh in the year of 2022, with a gross volume of US$ 662 million.

Ambassador Lee Jang-keun said this when he paid a farewell call on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at Ganobhaban on Tuesday.

The envoy shared with the prime minister the milestone development in relations between South Korea and Bangladesh in multiple areas, such as trade, official development assistance, expatriate workers and investment, in the year of 50th anniversary of Korea-Bangladesh diplomatic ties in 2023, said a spokesperson of the Korean embassy in Dhaka.

Mr Lee explained that the trade between Korea and Bangladesh crossed the $3 billion mark in 2022 and $2 billion in 2021 for the first time - the trade was stagnant at $1.5-1.8 billion over a decade before the Covid-19 pandemic.

He further elaborated that the Korean government has decided to provide the Bangladesh government with $3 billion under the EDCF (Economic Development Cooperation Fund), a soft loan programme, in the period of 2023-2027.

Korea's previous commitment stood at $500 million for three years when Ambassador Lee arrived in Bangladesh in June 2020.

Hiring Bangladeshi migrants is another arena where a meaningful development is seen over one or two years, said the envoy.

While only around 1,500 Bangladeshi workers were dispatched to Korea under Employment Permit System (EPS) until 2021, the number increased significantly to 5,891 in 2022 and the Korean government plans to receive 10,000 Bangladeshi expatriate workers this year.

Appreciating the vibrant socio-economic development of Bangladesh under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, outgoing Ambassador Lee expressed deep appreciation for extensive cooperation and hospitality by the prime minister and Bangladesh people during his tenure.

The premier congratulated Mr Lee on successful completion of his tenure in Bangladesh and thanked him for his efforts to further boost Korea-Bangladesh relations.

802,"Q1 denim exports to EU, US witness negative growth","Though Bangladesh dominates the global denim market, it witnessed a negative export growth of the items in both the European Union and USA during the first quarter (Q1) of this calendar year.

Exporters have attributed the fall to a sluggish demand in the markets due to economic slowdown triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war-induced high inflation that forced the consumers to prioritise their basic needs.

Exports of denim garments to the USA in January-March period of 2023 recorded over 33 per cent negative growth to US$131.44 million which was $196.25 million during the same quarter last year, according to data from OTEXA, an affiliate of the US Department of Commerce.

Bangladesh's denim export earnings from the USA stood at US$943.70 million in 2022 which were US$798.42 million in 2021, data showed.

Bangladesh is the top denim goods supplier to its single largest destination, USA, since 2020. In 2019, Mexico was the top supplier with $802 million exports, but it fell to $161.24 million only in Q1, 2023.

OTEXA data showed that the total US imports of denim apparel from the world in the Q1 decreased by 31.37 per cent to $662.44 million which was $965.28 million during the corresponding period of 2022.

Once the biggest denim exporter, China scored fifth position in the US market with $58.60 million, marking over 34 per cent negative growth.

Pakistan and Vietnam ranked third and fourth position with $74.11 million and $62.85 million respectively, according to data. When asked, Md Shahidullah Azim, vice president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said RMG exports to almost all the major destinations witnessed negative growth in the recent months and so did the denim goods.

""The main reason is the Russia-Ukraine war while high inflation forced consumers to prioritise their basic needs, mostly food, and discouraged fashion buying,"" he said.

Talking to the FE, Mr John of Chinese company Zhejiang Xinlan Textile Co. Ltd., also attributed the sluggish denim business in recent times to the war.

His company is participating at a two-day denim show - Bangladesh Denim Expo - organised by the Bangladesh Apparel Exchange at International Convention City Bashundhara (ICCB) in Dhaka.

He, however, said he is here in Dhaka to display their latest products, hold business meetings with his existing clients and explore new customers.

Md Hasibul Huda, deputy general manager of Pioneer Denim, said they also got less work orders from US and Canada, but work orders from the EU increased in recent months.

Tanvir Hossain, project manager of Jeanologia, a technology supplier company, said that despite a bleak economic situation in major export destinations, the global fashion brands are placing orders here in Bangladesh as the majority of the denim fabric makers and exporters are adopting new technologies that help reduce water consumption.

Jeanologia, a Spanish company, is also taking part in the expo that began on Tuesday. Some 90 exhibitors from home and abroad are showcasing their latest denim products, fabrics, accessories, chemicals and technologies.

Almost all the denim manufacturers in Bangladesh adopted new technologies like Ozone and laser in line with buyers demand, Mr Tanvir Hossain said, adding that the business is now going slow due to no or little expansion of local factories because of scarcity of work orders fueled by the global economic crisis.

He claimed that the expansion of denim factories as also the adoption of new technologies has brought down the use of water to 9-30 litres from around 360 litres to produce a pair of jeans. Brant Tong, sales manager of XDD Textile from Vietnam, hoped that the business would turn around within the next six months.

According to available BGMEA data for January-February period of 2023, Bangladesh fetched $234.06 million from denim exports to the EU, marking a 14.37 per cent negative growth.

Turkey shipped denim goods worth $184.08 million, followed by Pakistan $140.51 million during the period, marking over 23 per cent and 11 per cent negative growth respectively.

Bangladesh sustained its top position in the EU market since 2017, according to BGMEA data.

In 2022, Bangladesh fetched $1.55 billion from denim exports to the EU which was $1.18 billion in 2021, data showed.

According to Bangladesh Textile Mills Association, some 40 local mills produce denim fabrics.

804,BSEC to digitise capital market monitoring system to check forgery,"Bangladesh Securities Exchange Commission (BSEC), in collaboration with the government, is going to digitise the monitoring system of the capital market in order to combat forgery.

As part of this effort, BSEC will establish a fully digital and transparent governing board for data interoperability (FinTech), which would also ensure the interoperability of software services and operations of different organisations under BSEC.

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed on Sunday between the Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC) of the ICT Division and the Bangladesh Security Exchange Commission (BSEC) at the BSEC Multi-purpose Conference Hall, according to a press release.

The implementation of the Digital Transformation of the Bangladesh Capital Market: Data Interoperability (FinTech Board) will be financed by the World Bank-funded Enhancing Digital Government and Economy (EDGE) Project of BCC, with a target to complete it by 2026.

Ranajit Kumar, Executive Director of BCC, and Mohammed Shafiul Azam, Executive Director of BSEC, inked the MoU on behalf of their respective organisations.

ICT Secretary Md Shamsul Arefin, BSEC Chairman Shibli Rubayat Ul Islam, EDGE Project Director Dr Muhammed Mehedi Hassan, and BSEC Executive Director Mohammed Shafiul Azam attended the programme with BSEC Commissioner Dr Shamsuddin Ahmad in the chair.

The use of ICT in the capital market will not only reduce corruption but also curb the activities of those who are involved in manipulation, fraud, and looting in the share market, said Shibli Rubayat Ul Islam.

He said automation of BSEC and implementation of the FinTech Board at the initiative of the government will ensure interoperability of software-based services and operations among the organisations of BSEC and transparency of the capital market’s functions.

""The digital transformation of the traditional system of share market will help make a cost-effective capital market and bring the trust of the investors,"" ICT Secretary Md Shamsul Arefin said, adding that the beneficiaries, including investors, would be greatly benefitted as they would get better and faster services.

""We want to strengthen the surveillance system to check for fraud and forgery in the share market. The automation of traditional systems will help create a vibrant capital market,"" said Ranajit Kumar.

As per the MoU, emphasis will be given on standardising data and performance, implementing technological standards, defining processes and data, and creating a modern and sophisticated digitised ICT infrastructure. This digital transformation aims to enhance the contribution of the capital market to the economy and achieve Vision 2041.

BSEC will establish a fully digital, transparent, and governing FinTech Data Interoperability Board that will emphasise standardisation of data and performance, with a two-fold focus on the implementation of technological standards, the MoU said.

According to the MoU, the Bangladesh Securities Exchange Commission (BSEC) will conduct feasibility analysis, business and technical requirement analysis, project management, quality assurance, and other related activities to ensure the successful implementation of the FinTech Board project.

The Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC) will handle the procurement process and provide technical support for the implementation of the Digital Transformation of the Bangladesh Capital Market and the establishment of the FinTech Board by BSEC.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/stock/bsec-to-digitise-capital-market-monitoring-system-to-check-forgery,2023-05-18 10:34:53,thefinancialexpress
805,New push to recover investors' returns lost to a maze of real life & rules,"A stock investor, Abdul Latif (not the real name) passed away in the 90's without deciding who would be inheriting his stock holdings.

His two successors got locked into a fight over the ownership of the shares of listed securities. Hence, the companies were unable to transfer dividends of the late Latif to anyone else. For years, the undistributed dividends piled up and remained in a dormant account.

The above example is just one scenario explaining why dividends have been undistributed or unsettled for long.

The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) in 2021 estimated Tk 210 billion of undistributed or unclaimed dividends and formed Capital Market Stabilisation Fund (CMSF) to settle claims for dividends.

Quaiyum Khan, one of the founders of Independent University, Bangladesh, received undistributed dividends through the CMSF's intervention.

""My family's case regarding undistributed dividends was dissolved through prompt actions by the Stabilisation Fund,"" he said.

A multinational company, Singer Bangladesh has around 12,000 general shareholders. Around 800 of them still hold paper shares, said company secretary Kazi Ashiqur Rahman.

The shareholders may have forgotten that they have the shares or the ownership may have changed and the new owners are completely unaware of the existence of the assets. Some of them may also lack the knowledge that the paper shares had to be converted into an electronic form, a process called dematerialisation.

""We have to send their dividends through dividend warrants and 50 per cent of such warrants are returned,"" said Mr Rahman.

Thus, many investors lose out on dividends from investments made in the era of paper shares.

About 10 per cent of the dividends against demat shares [the shares that have been converted into digital form] is rejected by banks as the shareholders' account numbers are not updated.

As the Central Depository Bangladesh Limited (CDBL) started operating in 2000, investors began converting paper shares. Earlier, shares of listed securities were paper based and dividends were transferred manually.

After the introduction of the electronic fund transfer system, bank account numbers were changed adding new figures ahead of the previous numbers, explained Farhad Ahmed, a former BSEC executive director who once worked to settle investors' dividend claims.

""Many bank accounts were not re-opened accordingly and that's why the electronic system refuses to transfer dividends to those accounts,"" said Mr Ahmed, an incumbent managing director of Central Counterparty Bangladesh Ltd (CCBL).

Nominees' names are provided as investors open the accounts to transact shares digitally, still in some cases disputes arise over the ownership of dividends.

When the amount of dividends is significant, successors other than the nominee or nominees demand stakes and come up with an injunction order from the court.

In some cases, investors had purchased shares from other investors but did not transfer those into their digital accounts. In such cases, dividend warrants are sent to the addresses of the previous owner.

In the absence of the pro-rata basis IPO share allocation, many investors used to open as many BO (beneficiary owner's) accounts as possible, without mentioning accurate addresses, to apply for IPO shares.

Therefore, dividend warrants failed to get to the right address.

Many issuers took advantage of the problems surrounding dividend disbursement and withheld the returns.

Such companies deprived investors of dividends under the pretext of unavailability of investors or change of their addresses.

As of March this year, the Stabilisation Fund received undistributed cash dividends of Tk 5.15 billion and stock dividends of Tk 6.5 billion at the market price.

In the wake of the reluctance of many issuers to transfer unclaimed or undistributed dividends to the Fund, the securities regulator has decided to conduct audits of the companies to find out the exact amount of such dividends.

The CMSF is now at an advanced stage of forming a panel that will audit 50 companies in the first phase.

As per an initial estimate, dividends worth around Tk 63 billion remain in the accounts of those issuers.

The audit panel will be formed through competitive bidding, and a body comprising representatives of the securities regulator and issuers will oversee the process.

Meanwhile, four companies have transferred unclaimed or undistributed dividends into the CMSF's account.

Of those, Square Pharmaceuticals paid off unclaimed cash dividends amounting to Tk 40 million. Social Islami Bank transferred 1.15 million unclaimed bonus shares, Apex Weaving 0.45 million bonus shares and Tamij Uddin Textile Mills 0.50 million bonus shares.

Some other companies, including Singer Bangladesh, said they had already transferred unclaimed dividends into the CMSF's account.

The CMSF will be able to use the funds not claimed by shareholders to give a boost to the market.

Licht, who has served as president of Reckitt's health business and as chief customer officer since July 2020, will be appointed to the board as an executive director from June 1.

""Having played a pivotal role in both the transformation strategy and the significant turnaround of our Health GBU over the last three years, Kris is the right leader to take Reckitt on the next stage of its exciting journey,"" Durante, a former BAT chief executive, said.

""It was a very well-informed choice and the board had the luxury of time because I was here ... that's why the process took eight months.""

Durante will stay with Reckitt until December ""to ensure a smooth transition"".

Neil Denman, a fund manager at Reckitt investor Sarasin & Partners, said: ""I very much like the continuity of an internal appointment. You're not getting an external CEO saying they're going to come in and change things.""

The company, which makes Durex condoms and Lysol cleaning products, also reported like-for-like net revenue up 7.9 per cent in the first quarter, beating analyst expectations of a 3.6 per cent rise in consensus forecast provided by the company.

""A good set of results after what has been quite a choppy time for the company,"" Denman said, referring to the CEO's looming departure.

Reckitt, which also makes Nurofen tablets, cold remedy Lemsip and Dettol hygiene products, now expects like-for-like net revenue growth of 3-5 per cent for the year after beating sales expectations for several quarters in a row, helped by price increases.

The consumer goods industry has increased prices to make up for about two years of rising raw materials prices and supply chain and energy costs, which began with the pandemic and was exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

In some cases, manufacturers' price increases have prompted shoppers to shift away from big brands towards retailers' cheaper own-label products and investors have voiced concerns about the impact on sales volumes and margins if prices continue to rise.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/stock/reckitt-names-kris-licht-as-ceo,2023-05-18 10:34:54,thefinancialexpress

“As this technology advances, we understand that people are anxious about how it could change the way we live. We are too,” OpenAI CEO said.

Altman proposed the formation of a US or global agency that would licence the most powerful AI systems and have the authority to ‘take that licence away and ensure compliance with safety standards’.

Altman, asked to opine on which AI should be subject to licencing, said a model that can persuade or manipulate a person's beliefs would be an example of a ""great threshold.""

He also said companies should have the right to say they do not want their data used for AI training, which is one idea being discussed on Capitol Hill. Altman said, however, that material on the public web would be fair game.

Altman also said he ""wouldn't say never"" to the idea of advertising but preferred a subscription-based model.

His San Francisco-based startup rocketed to public attention after it released ChatGPT late last year. The free chatbot tool answers questions with convincingly human-like responses.

For months, companies large and small have raced to bring increasingly versatile AI to market, throwing endless data and billions of dollars at the challenge. Some critics fear the technology will exacerbate societal harms, among them prejudice and misinformation, while others warn AI could end humanity itself.

""There's no way to put this genie in the bottle. Globally, this is exploding,"" said Senator Cory Booker, one of many lawmakers with questions about how best to regulate AI.

Senator Mazie Hirono noted the danger of misinformation as the 2024 election nears. ""In the election context, for example, I saw a picture of former President Trump being arrested by NYPD and that went viral,"" she said, pressing Altman on whether he would consider the faked image harmful.

Altman responded that creators should make clear when an image is generated rather than factual.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/sci-tech/chatgpt-chief-says-artificial-intelligence-should-be-regulated-to-mitigate-risks,2023-05-18 10:34:55,thefinancialexpress
810,Astronomers witness largest cosmic explosion ever,"A team of astronomers has witnessed the largest cosmic explosion ever recorded, an event that released more energy than any supernova and lasted for three years. The explosion, dubbed AT2021lwx, occurred 8 billion light-years away from Earth and is thought to have been caused by a giant cloud of gas being swallowed by a supermassive black hole.

The discovery was made by astronomers using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in California. ZTF is a wide-field telescope that is designed to detect transient objects, such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.

In November 2020, ZTF spotted a bright new object in the constellation Ursa Major. The object, which was given the designation AT2021lwx, quickly brightened and reached a peak brightness that was 10 times brighter than a typical supernova.

Astronomers were initially puzzled by the nature of AT2021lwx. It was much brighter than a supernova, but it did not show the characteristic features of a gamma-ray burst. After several months of observations, astronomers eventually determined that AT2021lwx was caused by a giant cloud of gas being swallowed by a supermassive black hole.

The black hole was likely millions or even billions of times more massive than the sun. As the gas fell into the black hole, it was heated to extreme temperatures and released a massive amount of energy. This energy caused the gas to glow brightly, creating the explosion that astronomers observed.

The discovery of AT2021lwx is a significant event in astronomy. It is the largest cosmic explosion ever recorded and provides new insights into the behaviour of supermassive black holes. The explosion also raises the possibility that similar events may have occurred in the early universe, helping to shape the evolution of galaxies and stars.

What does the discovery of AT2021lwx tell us about the universe?

The discovery of AT2021lwx tells us several things about the universe. First, it shows that supermassive black holes can be incredibly powerful. The explosion released more energy than the sun will in its entire lifetime.

Second, it suggests that supermassive black holes may play a role in the formation of galaxies. The energy released by the explosion may have helped to shape the galaxy in which it occurred. It also raises the possibility that similar explosions may have occurred in the early universe. If so, they could have played a role in forming the first galaxies and stars.

811,"All you need to know about Google's Bard AI, the ChatGPT competitor","Google has been developing a new artificial intelligence (AI) system called Bard. Bard is a large language model (LLM) trained on a massive dataset of text and code. This allows Bard to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

Bard is still under development, but it has learned to perform many kinds of tasks, including:

Following users' instructions and completing requests thoughtfully.

Using its knowledge to answer questions comprehensively and informally, even if they are open-ended, challenging, or strange.

Generating different creative text formats of text content, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, emails, letters, etc.

Bard is a powerful tool that can be used for various purposes. It can be used for research, education, and entertainment. It can also help people with tasks such as writing, translating, and coding.

Bard is still under development. It has emerged as the competitor of ChatGPT. However, it has a long way to go yet.

How Bard works

Bard is a large language model (LLM) trained on a massive dataset of text and code. This dataset includes text from books, articles, websites, and code from GitHub repositories. It uses this dataset to learn the statistical relationships between words and phrases. This allows Bard to generate grammatically correct and semantically meaningful text.

Bard also uses its knowledge of the world to answer questions comprehensively and informally.

For instance, if you ask Bard, ""What is the capital of France?"" Bard will not only tell you that the capital of France is Paris, but it will also provide you with information about the city's history, culture, and economy.

Unique features of Bard

Bard has many unique features that make it a powerful tool which is actually similar to ChatGPT.

Bard's ability to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer questions in an informative way. This AI tool is also capable of learning and improving over time. However, its ability to access and process information from the real world through Google Search gives it an edge over its competitor ChatGPT.

Bard's launch and challenges

Google's Bard AI chatbot was launched in March 2023 with much fanfare. However, controversy quickly overshadowed the launch when Bard provided inaccurate information about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). During a demo, Bard stated that the JWST had taken the first pictures of a planet outside our solar system. This was not true, and users quickly pointed out the error.

The controversy raised concerns about Bard's reliability and accuracy. Google apologised for the error and announced that it would be conducting a rigorous testing process to ensure the accuracy of Bard's responses in the future.

Google also created a Trusted Tester program to allow users to help identify and correct errors in Bard's responses.

Despite these efforts, Bard has continued to face criticism. Some users have complained that Bard struggles to answer basic questions, has long response times, and does not automatically include sources for its information. Others have expressed concerns about Bard's potential to generate harmful or offensive content.

Future

It remains to be seen whether Bard will overcome the challenges it faces and become a successful AI chatbot. Google is committed to improving Bard, and the company has made significant progress in recent months. However, there are still some fundamental challenges that Bard will need to overcome, such as its reliance on large amounts of training data that may contain biases.

Despite the challenges, Bard has the potential to be a valuable tool for users who need assistance with research, writing, or creative tasks. Google is continuing to develop Bard, and the company is optimistic that it will eventually become a leading AI chatbot.

813,New Twitter CEO inspired by Elon Musk’s vision to create a brighter future,"Newly appointed Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a tweet on Saturday that she has been inspired by owner Elon Musk's vision to create a brighter future and is excited to help to transform the social media platform.

It was the first time Yaccarino has spoken publicly since the news broke Thursday that she was in talks to become the next CEO of Twitter. Musk, who has served as CEO since his $44 billion buyout of Twitter last October, announced her appointment on Friday, reports Reuters.

""I've long been inspired by [Musk's] vision to create a brighter future. I'm excited to help bring this vision to Twitter and transform this business together!"" Yaccarino tweeted.

Yaccarino, who as advertising chief for Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal spent several years modernising its ad business, said she is committed to Twitter's future, and said user feedback is vital to build Twitter 2.0.

Yaccarino will take over a social media platform that has been trying to reverse a plunge in ad revenue and is beset with challenges, along with a heavy debt load.

Since Musk acquired Twitter, advertisers have fled the platform, worried that their ads could appear next to inappropriate content after the company lost nearly 80 per cent of staff. Musk earlier this year acknowledged that Twitter had suffered a massive decline in ad revenue.

While Musk said Yaccarino would help build an ""everything app,"" which he has previously said could offer a variety of services such as peer-to-peer payments, his selection of an advertising veteran signaled that digital ads would continue to be a core focus of the business.

He also reiterated his plan to turn Twitter into ""X, the everything app.""

Musk acquired the social media platform for 44 billion U.S. dollars last year. The company was reincorporated into X Corp. last month and no longer exists as a separate corporation, but it still uses the brand name, reports Xinhua.

815,BTRC readies draft guideline for dot bd and dot bangla domains,"The country's telecom regulator has prepared a draft guideline for administering domains ‘dot bd’ and ‘dot bangla’ (in Bangla character).

The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) issued the much-needed guideline, open for stakeholders' opinions. The guideline did not make trade licence mandatory for getting a domain name.

Though the Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Ltd (BTCL) is currently responsible for domain registration, the draft guideline said the BTRC itself may act as the registrar or appoint a registrar to administer the Bangla domains.

According to the draft guideline, only Bangladeshi entities can avail these domains. In case of foreign entities, the domains will be allocated following submission of proper documents on presence in Bangladesh.

Of these domains, .bd is the internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Bangladesh. It is currently administered by the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology. Registrations are open with it, except in .gov and .mil sub-domains, which are limited to authorised entities in the Bangladesh government.

Though its online registration is available, currently the BTCL is only allowing second-level domain registration of .bd domain for Bangladeshi citizens only. It is only allowing the structure of websites like - example.com.bd, but not like - example.bd.

On the other hand, dot bangla is the second country code top-level domain that was granted to Bangladesh in 2011. The domain is meant for the web addresses in Bangla language.

Though dot bd domain was introduced on 20 May 1999, the BTCL started registering it for general people in 2003.

Similarly, dot bangla domain was introduced in 2011, but the BTCL started the process of assigning domain names for websites on 1 January 2017.

Bangladesh had to fight influential India and West African country Sierra Leone to win dot bangla domain, written in Bangla script. These two countries wanted the domain, claiming that Bangla was their language too.

However, these two domains are not popular in Bangladesh due to many hurdles, including presentation of a trade licence before getting a domain name.

According to industry stakeholders, the domain numbers are more or less around 5,000 each month.

Generative AI can, using past data, create brand new content like fully formed text, images and software code.

OpenAI, backed by billions of dollars from Microsoft and now integrated into Bing search, has become for many the default version of generative AI, helping users spin up term papers, contracts, travel itineraries, even entire novels.

818,NBR tasked to collect Tk 4.30 trillion,"An 'ambitious' revenue target set for the next budget prompts the government to estimate 36 per cent of the domestic revenues to be realized from direct taxes, hugely banking on import duties.

For the upcoming financial year (FY) 2023-24, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has set Tk 4.30 trillion as revenue-collection target for the National Board of Revenue (NBR).

Of the target, Tk 1.54 trillion is set to be collected by the direct-tax wing while Tk 1.16 trillion by the customs wing of the revenue board.

However, the highest is earmarked to be mobilized by the value-added tax (VAT) wing, amounting to Tk 1.59 trillion.

Target for income tax has been set at Tk 1.22 trillion while it is Tk 1.36 trillion for VAT and import taxes Tk 1.11 trillion in FY 23.

The government is set to propose in parliament a Tk 7.64 trillion worth of national budget for the upcoming fiscal on June 01.

Officials say the tax-revenue target has been set ""ambitiously, as usual, like in previous years despite having limited scope to achieve it"".

A senior NBR official says the board may not offer any gross exemption to any sector as it needs to mobilize domestic revenue to meet the target advised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The IMF has recommended for the NBR to increase the country's tax-GDP ratio by 0.5 each percentage point in FY 23 and FY 24 and 0.7 percentage point by FY 25.

Projections by two leading think-tanks signal high revenue shortfalls in the current fiscal. The Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) and PRI earlier estimated that the NBR might face a shortfall against tax-revenue collection worth Tk 750 billion and Tk 546 billion respectively in the current fiscal year.

According to data available with Finance Division under the MoF, the government's tax-revenue collection was Tk 2.87 trillion in the last FY against its target for Tk 3.30 trillion. In the current FY, the NBR will have to collect Tk 3.70 trillion in tax revenue until June 30, 2023.

With the projected shortfalls in CPD and PRI calculations, the NBR will have to achieve over 32-percent growth in tax-revenue collection in the upcoming fiscal year to reach the Tk 4.30-trillion target.

Domestic tax-revenue collection had faced a shortfall worth Tk 375.33 billion until April against its target.

In the July-April period, the NBR achieved 5.90-percent growth over the corresponding period last year, according to provisional NBR data.

Revenue-collection growth was 12 per cent on average during the last five years.

The NBR collected Tk 2.47 trillion in tax revenue in July-April period against its target for Tk 2.84 trillion.

The board will have to collect Tk 1.22 trillion in revenue in May and June, Tk 613.03 billion per month, to achieve the target Tk 3.70 trillion set for this year.

Dr Ahsan H Mansur, Executive Director of the Policy Research Institute (PRI), predicts ""it's not possible to achieve the ambitious growth"" in tax-revenue collection since no reforms have been carried out for a long time.

""The government should set a realistic tax-revenue-collection target on the basis of actual tax-revenue collection. Fixing target setting growth on budget to budget should be avoided,"" he suggests.

During the last 12 years, the NBR had achieved tax-revenue-collection target once only, he said.

""Efficiencies of tax administration have also deteriorated over time. Tax-GDP ratio is declining while revenue-collection growth has also witnessed a sluggish trend,"" he adds.

According to the PRI's Study Center for Domestic Resource Mobilisation, tax-GDP ratio declined to 7.4 per cent in FY 2023 from 7.9 per cent last year.

819,"Finance News: Latest Financial News, Finance News today in Bangladesh","Director General of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) Dr Binayak Sen speaks at an event titled 'Development Prospects and Challenges' at a hotel in Dhaka on Wednesday. Planning Minister MA Mannan was present as the chief guest at the event arranged by BIDS. — FE photo

The poverty headcount in the country decreased by 4.3 percentage points during a period between 2019 and 2022 while the proportion of extreme poor went down by 3.2 percentage points.

Self-employment income, government transfer receipts, access to mobile financial services and financial dissaving have contributed to the poverty reduction, according to findings of a latest research conducted by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS).

Director General of the state-run research body Dr. Binayak Sen revealed the findings in a presentation on ""Urban Poverty Dynamics During Covid-19: Anatomy of Resilience"" at the inaugural session of a two-day BIDS Research ALMANAC 2023 in a city hotel on Wednesday.

""As many claim that the poverty situation deteriorated significantly during the Covid-19, the BIDS study examined the claims by using macro, sectoral and household-level panel data,"" he told the event.

To the extent that the Coronavirus mainly concentrated in urban areas of Bangladesh with greater spread recorded in the megacity of Dhaka, the research findings on urban poverty dynamics merit closer policy attention to understand the wellbeing effects of the pandemic.

However, the analysis of poverty dynamics further revealed that urban chronic poverty is still considerable even in a high-growing megacity like Dhaka.

""About one-tenth of the urban population belonged to this category,"" said the study. The evidence further showed the importance of ""new poor"" as a new social category emerging as a result of the pandemic.

""Out of the contingent of the total poor in 2022 (whose overall incidence is on decline), 51 per cent belong to the 'new poor' category,"" Dr Sen said in his keynote paper.

These 51 per cent or around 15 million people have slipped below the poverty line after losing their jobs and businesses during the pandemic.

The study did not find any significant adverse effects of coronavirus on increasing divorce rate, triggering adolescent marriage rate for daughters, or deteriorating law and order in the community during the difficult months.

However, 23.5 per cent of extreme poor households reported that they had to stop their children's education - 13.6 per cent for the poor, 10.3 per cent for the lower middle class and 8.0 per cent for the upper middle class.

The study suggested initiating a special education-recovery programme for the urban poor to minimise the learning losses and facilitate re-entry of their children into the educational stream.

Dr Sen criticised a study that suggested the poverty rate had soared to 42 per cent during the pandemic, saying it was a 'blunder' caused by hurried research.

Based on their work in 2020, some development organisations said the poverty had doubled. In January 2021, researchers of the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling, or SANEM, claimed that the poverty rate had climbed to 42 per cent based on a survey carried out across 5,577 families around the country in November-December 2020.

Mr Sen claimed that it was 'temporary and for that time only'. ""This happened in April-June 2020 and began falling after June.""

Another joint survey of Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC) and BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD) also claimed in June last that the number of new poor in the country stood at 30.9 million, which was 18.54 per cent of the population.

A year ago, the same researchers found that the pandemic had pushed 24.5 million people - 14.75 per cent of the country's population - into poverty in one year.

Speaking at the inaugural session, Planning Minister MA Mannan emphasised on reducing the widening gap between the urban and rural population, and urged the researchers to use one type of data for the entire country rather than dividing urban and poor.

He admitted that the inequality is increasing in the country and said inequality is a core problem in every developing nation.

""I think the inequality is created by us. So we have to create new resources and bridge the gap by fairly distributing it in the social safety sector.""

He also called for conducting more research on how to increase the existing wealth, underscoring the need for removing discrimination from society.

""We need to conduct research on how we can increase our existing wealth,"" said the minister. ""Wealth creation comes with the risk of discrimination. However, deliberate discrimination can be controlled by creating a society based on justice.""

He said poverty cannot be eliminated entirely but it can definitely be reduced to some extent. ""It is something that is created. So it can be reduced as well.""

Mr Mannan said the government has adopted social safety net programmes to improve the living standard of the poor and underscored the importance of knowing the contributions of domestic work to recognise the real economic scenario of the country.

It is important to know the contributions of domestic work carried out by our mothers and sisters at home so that we can draw a parallel picture of our economy, he added.

State Minister for Planning Dr Shamsul Alam said the research will help the government plan projects and appreciated Dr Sen for breaking the myth that Covid had increased the poverty in the country.

According to a paper titled ""Public Paddy e-Procurement Programme in Bangladesh: Effects and Efficacy"" presented at the first technical session, paddy e-procurement has a positive effect on rice income.

The study conducted by Taznoore Samina Khanam, Kazi Iqbal and M. Mehrab Bakhtiar found higher transaction cost in e-procurement than that of the traditional system due to mismanagement.

It also found that many times the ""Krishi card"" is being used by the non-farmers while the farmers are not aware of it. ""In this case, it is necessary to provide a registered mobile phone number in the card.""

820,Electricity may eat up one-third of subsidies,"Jacking up electricity subsidy, particularly as power generation in private plants remains expensive, is set to swell the overall amount of fiscal incentives in the forthcoming national budget, officials said.

The government is likely to allocate nearly Tk 320 billion in subsidy for the power sector in the fiscal year (FY) 2023-24 national budget, nearly 39-percent higher than in the revised budget for the current fiscal, Ministry of Finance (MoF) officials told the FE Wednesday.

The total subsidy in the upcoming budget might come to Tk 1.10 trillion-Tk120 billion higher than the current fiscal's revised outlay on this head.

In the original budget's subsidy figure for the current FY2023 was Tk 814.90 billion, which was recently revised upward to Tk 980 billion.

Meanwhile, the government is set to propose in parliament a Tk 7.64 trillion worth of national budget for the upcoming fiscal on June 01.

""As the US dollar price has increased a lot over the year and there are some previous pending payments on capacity charges to the private-sector local and International Power Producers (IPPs), we need an increased amount of power subsidy in the next fiscal,"" says a senior MoF official.

The state-run Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) needs more money to pay off previous dues to the IPPS and power producers as it purchased electricity from them, he adds.

Meanwhile, the government has increased the power price at consumer level thrice in recent past, which has eased the pressure on the fiscal support from the government.

However, the arrears in last fiscal year's (FY2022) subsidy have prompted the government to boost the total subsidy by nearly 39 per cent in the next budget, MoF officials said.

They said the subsidies on agriculture, stimulus and other fiscal benefits for others are also likely to be increased in the next national budget.

In the agriculture sector, the subsidy may be increased to nearly Tk270 billion as the ministry has demanded higher funds for paying arrears and minimising the gap between fertiliser import and consumer-level prices.

A total of Tk160 billion was allocated as agriculture subsidy in the budget for the current FY2023. In the revised budget, the allocation was ramped up to Tk260 billion as the fertilizer price on the international market remained volatile.

In the budget for the last FY2022, there was an allocation of Tk91 billion for subsidies in agriculture.

Meanwhile, the government has already decided to increase the prices of all types of fertilisers by Tk5.0 per kg, which will save some Tk70 billion in its marketing.

MoF officials said the post-Covid impact and the Ukraine-Russia war affected the global market prices of fuel oils, fertilisers, food products and gas, resulting in the augmenting of overall subsidy demand by various ministries for the next budget.

Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has suggested that the government cut its subsidy on energy, agriculture and all other sectors to maintain fiscal discipline as Bangladesh is going to graduate from its LDC status to a developing nation in 2026.

""Although the last IMF mission has already raised questions on the extended subsidy allocation in the next budget, but we have no option at this moment to cut it drastically overnight,"" another senior MoF official told the FE.

""We will be reducing our subsidy gradually which would also minimize pressure on the country's fiscal discipline.""

The MoF officials said in the current fiscal budget, about Tk60 billion was allocated for food subsidy, and in the revised budget, an additional allocation of Tk8.12 billion.

An allocation of Tk80 billion has been estimated for subsidizing food in the upcoming FY2024, they said.

821,Nagad Finance PLC gets NBFI licence,"Nagad Finance PLC has received a licence from the Bangladesh Bank (BB) to operate as a new non-bank financial institution (NBFI) in the country, according to a circular issued by the central bank.

Nagad Finance PLC is a strategic business unit of Bangladesh Post Office's digital financial service provider.

The order, signed on Wednesday by BB Deputy Governor Ahmed Jamal, said that Nagad Finance PLC has been permitted to engage in financing business in Bangladesh.

However, Nagad Finance PLC is a separate organisation in which the Bangladesh Post Office has no stake, as it did not have equity participation.

Meanwhile, it has been learned that the new NBFI may commence operations on July 1 this year. Earlier, the BB Board approved Nagad as an NBFI.

Non-Bank Financial Institutions (FIs) are financial institutions regulated under the Financial Institution Act-1993 and controlled by the Bangladesh Bank. Currently, 35 FIs are operating in Bangladesh.

The paid-up capital of the NBFI is Tk 1.0 billion, with an authorised capital of Tk 5.0 billion.

Previously, the BB board issued a letter of intent against Nagad Finance PLC.

Muhammad Farid Khan, vice-chairman of Summit Group, will serve as the chairman of the NBFI, which will be headquartered in the city's Banani area on Kamal Ataturk Road.

Mr Tanvir A Mishuk, managing director of Nagad, is also a director of the proposed NBFI.

However, Nagad Finance PLC will promote its products and services through Nagad Limited.

Together, Nagad Finance PLC and Nagad Limited will work to bring the underserved into the fold of digital financial inclusion. Nagad has been operating under a temporary MFS licence since 2019 through a service agreement with the Bangladesh Post Office. The relationship between Nagad and the Post Office is solely based on revenue sharing under the service agreement.

828,"Finance News: Latest Financial News, Finance News today in Bangladesh","The UAE's newly appointed ambassador to Bangladesh Abdulla Ali AlHmoudi paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at her official residence Ganobhaban in the city on Wednesday — PID

The United Arab Emirates will continue its cooperation with Bangladesh in the development of its infrastructure and sea ports for mutual benefits, reports UNB.

The UAE's newly appointed ambassador to Bangladesh Abdulla Ali AlHmoudi said this during a courtesy call on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at Ganabhaban on Wednesday.

Prime Minister's Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim briefed reporters after the meeting.

The UAE envoy said that his county will carry forward the friendship and cooperation with Bangladesh for economic development.

Ali AlHmoudi apprised the prime minister about his meeting with Bangladesh's state minister of civil aviation and tourism regarding the cooperation in the aviation sector.

The ambassador recalled that the foundation of the bilateral relation between Bangladesh and the UAE was laid by fathers of the two nations Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan through a visit to the Gulf nation by Bangabandhu in 1974.

Later, Sheikh Nahyan also visited Dhaka in 1984 and played a very pivotal role in establishing solid foundation of the bilateral ties between the two brotherly countries, he added.

During the meeting, the prime minister highly appreciated the UAE leadership as they are going to host the COP-28 summit meeting in November next in Dubai.

About Bangladeshi expatriates working in the UAE and Middle Eastern countries, she put emphasis on learning Arabic language by those seeking to go there for jobs.

829,Millions of children at risk in Cyclone Mocha aftermath,"Bangladesh and Myanmar face significant disruptions in the aftermath of Cyclone Mocha, as millions of vulnerable children and families grapple with the fallout, UNICEF said on Wednesday.

According to the UN agency, the trail of destruction left by the cyclone not only affects those already living in dire conditions but also poses a severe threat to the well-being of numerous communities.

While the worst of the storm has subsided, the potential for landslides remains high, and the looming danger of waterborne diseases is likely to escalate in the coming days, noted UNICEF.

Cyclone Mocha struck the coastlines of Bangladesh and Myanmar on May 14, unleashing torrential downpours, storm surges, and fierce winds that reached a staggering 175 mph.

""Some of the world's most vulnerable children and families are, yet again, at the sharp end of a crisis they didn't create. The areas hit hardest by the storm are home to communities already living through conflict, poverty, instability, and climate and environmental shocks,"" said UNICEF's Executive Director Catherine Russell.

""As we urgently assess and respond to the immediate needs of children in the aftermath of this cyclone, we know with certainty that the best way to save and improve the lives of children and their families is by finding long-term solutions.""

By late Sunday, the storm weakened, leaving behind destroyed homes, health facilities, schools, and other critical infrastructure. Many of the hundreds of thousands of people affected are refugees or internally displaced people (IDPs), living in poorly structured shelters in camps and hard-to-reach areas.

They rely heavily on humanitarian assistance for food, water, health, education, and protection.

The situation is particularly worrisome in Myanmar. More than 16 million people - 5.6 million of them children - including 1.2 million internally displaced people of Rohingya, ethnic Rakhine and other communities, were in the path of the cyclone in Rakhine State, and locations in the north-west including Chin State and Sagaing and Magway regions.

The areas are low-lying and highly prone to flooding landslides.

Assessments of the extent of the damage in Myanmar are challenging, mainly due to interrupted transport and telecommunication services and the inaccessibility of some roads due to trees falling and debris. However, early reports show that children were reportedly among the victims of the storm.

In Bangladesh, home to the world's largest refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, one million Rohingya refugees faced the brunt of the heavy storms, half of them children. The refugee camps rank among the most tightly packed places on earth, exposing children to conditions ripe for disease, malnutrition, neglect, exploitation, and violence. The camps are also prone to mudslides, and children live in fragile temporary shelters.

833,A governance analysis of Dhaka's earthquake unpreparedness,"A 4.9 magnitude earthquake at 10 km depth that originated in Dohar Upazila, struck Dhaka on May 5, 2023. It occurred at around six in the morning when the city was asleep, and there was very little earthquake preparedness. Fortunately, this was not a big earthquake, but it is indeed a wake-up call for us to take earthquake preparedness seriously.

It is seemingly the case that Dhaka is not taking earthquakes ""seriously"". The nature of an earthquake as a disaster is that it can happen anytime, anywhere-- given that Dhaka's location is quite sensitive on the seismic plates. Therefore, Dhaka is essentially on a ticking time bomb, and must take immediate measures to prepare.

EARTHQUAKE GOVERNANCE IN DHAKA: Tracing back 105 years, in 1918, at Sreemangal, a 7.5 Richter scale major earthquake was recorded in Bangladesh. Going back 104 years, 115.8 km away from Dhaka, at Kishoreganj, the most high-scale recorded earthquake took place at 15 km depth and 7.2 Richter scale. Although Dhaka has yet to experience a disastrous earthquake similar to that, the city's preparation is still a critical concern because it is in an earthquake-prone area.

Unfortunately, there is no up-to-date earthquake preparedness strategy for the city, and despite having buildings and infrastructure codes in policy now, these are not being followed meaning many buildings made in the past not following guidelines still stand tall. These buildings are more prone to earthquake damage because the standard of construction and the materials used need to be appropriately monitored. The city needs a coordinated response strategy for earthquakes or other natural catastrophes. In the recent earthquake, city dwellers were in a state of panic mode because they did not know what to do. Moreover, since there is an absence of skilled workers and equipment that would be needed in an emergency, they were puzzled by the situation.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN DHAKA: The need for citizen awareness in Dhaka's earthquake governance is the topmost problem. Since many people did not know what to do in an earthquake, they felt unprotected and unprepared in the recent occurance. For instance, many of them needed clarification on whether they should leave the building, or stay inside. They were in a fix whether to use the lift or not. Some thought they should go to an open space, while others thought staying inside was safer. But even for those who thought to stay inside, they did not have the preparedness of going under a safe table, or to have an emergency kit (mineral water, energy biscuit, dry foods, medicine, torch or flashlight etcetera) with themselves. Those who went outside did not know where to go in the absence of any demarcated space to take shelter in such emergencies. All of these are due to lack of proper drills on earthquake preparedness to build informed awareness among the citizens.

Further, earthquakes need to be understood as a compound disaster because they might trigger other tragedies, including but not limited to fire, gas leakage, electric line outage, nuclear disaster, tsunami etcetera. Given this, the planning to prepare for earthquakes needs to be done in a holistic way that deals with other potential disasters.

DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS PLAN: With the participation of all parties, including government agencies, civil society organisations, and corporate sector representatives, a thorough earthquake preparedness strategy should be urgently created for Dhaka. City's high-risk zones should be identified in the plan, along with standards for the construction, maintenance of buildings and infrastructure, as well as procedures for emergency response, communication, and evacuation.

Added protections for vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, and those with disabilities should be included in the plan. In order to do this, it may be necessary to designate safe locations for these groups to congregate in the event of an earthquake and to train staff to aid and support them.

ENSURING COMPLIANCE AND RAISING AWARENESS: The city must invest in a thorough monitoring and enforcement system to guarantee adherence to building rules. This might entail the establishment of a special division within the local government tasked with keeping an eye on the quality of building materials and construction. Owners of buildings should be responsible for any violations of building codes, and punitive measures including fines and other sanctions should be in place for offenders. Programmes should be funded to build skills of engineers and architects in constructing earthquake-resistant buildings to ensure that every new building in the city is made to withstand earthquakes. Similarly, money should be spent on staff training and equipment purchases to strengthen emergency services to respond to earthquakes and other natural catastrophes.

The city should also invest in communication infrastructure, including an earthquake early warning system. Regular practice drills and exercises must be arranged to evaluate how well the emergency response procedures work. Further, public education programmes should be funded adequately to increase awareness among its residents. This can entail producing educational materials explaining earthquake preparedness and safety, by means of as pamphlets and movies. To identify and address specific issues about earthquake preparedness, the city should interact with the local community. For instance, in heavily populated city regions, the emphasis can be on locating secure locations where people can seek refuge in an earthquake. Making sure that inexpensive, earthquake-resistant housing is available may be the main priority in locations with a high concentration of low-income individuals.

LESSONS FROM AROUND THE WORLD: Lessons learned from experiences around the globe highlight the value of investing in earthquake resilience measures. Japan, a nation susceptible to earthquakes, has successfully put in place early warning systems, construction rules, earthquake preparedness plans, and training for emergency responders. One important lesson from Tokyo that other susceptible cities like Dhaka should take is the value of spending money on earthquake-resistant building materials and methods to reduce damage and casualties. Even in 2011, when a 9.1 Richter scale earthquake hit Tokyo, almost no buildings collapsed. In contrast, during a big earthquake, Haiti's lack of emergency services, inadequate response systems and poor coordination among various authorities resulted in a disjointed and ineffective response. This demonstrates the necessity of funding emergency services and response systems to prepare for such natural calamities.

A sophisticated early warning system has been built in California, USA to offer crucial seconds of notice before an earthquake strikes. This system employs a network of seismic sensors to identify earthquakes and notify individuals via a variety of channels including mobile network, TV, and radio channel so people can take necessary measures. Similarly, the comprehensive framework for earthquake resilience developed in New Zealand highlights the significance of coordinated and cooperative actions across public and private sector institutions and local communities. This strategy combines non-regulatory actions like public awareness campaigns and community involvement with regulatory ones like building rules and land use planning.

FINAL THOUGHTS: Establishing thorough earthquake preparedness plans, enforcing building rules, educating emergency responders, and investing in communication infrastructure are all measures of earthquake resilience that must be taken seriously. Dhaka may take the required measures to ensure that it is appropriately prepared for earthquakes and other natural disasters by learning from the best practices of cities such as Tokyo and California, and the worst practices of cities such as Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

In conclusion, creating a thorough earthquake preparedness plan, guaranteeing adherence to construction rules, funding emergency services, and increasing citizen knowledge are essential to enhancing Dhaka's seismic resilience.

834,Carrying out campaign against TB,"If tuberculosis (TB) still claims 121 lives a day in Bangladesh, particularly at a time when the disease is both preventable and curable, it surely is a cause for grave concern. It is indication enough of a number of negative factors existing in the country's socio-economic systems. First, a sizeable number of people, including children, cannot eat foods full of enough nutrition to provide them with the immunity against the disease. Second, many of the affected people do not go for early screening to know if they have got TB. Third, even if some of them go for treatment, they do not complete the course of treatment when they feel relatively better inviting emergence of new strains of bacteria. Fourth, an awareness campaign and dissemination of information about availability of free treatment at different TB centres are sorely missing.

A report carried in this newspaper on Tuesday last has focused on the prevalence of the disease in Bangladesh against the global perspective. Globally almost a quarter of the population, the report says, is infected with its bacteria. Worse, defying the previous downward trend of TB incidence and mortality, in 2020 the mortality from the disease went up for the first time in a decade. The reason, understandably, was the Covid-19's impact on people's food intake. A direct link between undernutrition and prevalence of TB is quite evident to the pandemic time's situation. If this is so, a mini edition of the pandemic adversity is sure to be staged once again. There is all the makeup of the situation with marginal and low-income people in this country now skipping costlier nutritious food items and even meals in certain cases. Poor and vulnerable people are locked in a struggle to barely keep their bodies and souls together. Even if they wanted, they are unable to avoid the consequences of malnutrition because their financial ability does not allow them to manage foods providing required nutrition.

With no sign of the war in Ukraine coming to an end and dollar crunch hampering import of fossil fuels, Bangladesh's energy sector is suffering a setback with adverse consequences for almost every sector, the manufacturing sector the worst of all. Thus, the cost of production soars and market volatility made further worse by trade syndicates. Commodities are now dearer than those should be and the poorer segments of society are paying through the nose. Their income has not increased and in real terms it has diminished and is likely to do so further, forcing them to cut on quality and even quantity of foods.

Thus, the incidence of tuberculosis may be higher once again compared to 2020. Before this happens, the administration should embark on arresting the artificial price hike and at the same time make arrangement for nutritional supplementation, especially for children in poor families. Way back in the 60s and 70s, there were programmes for free distribution of powder milk and soya biscuits among school children. A similar programme can be launched in order to supplement the need for nutrition among children of poor families in villages and city slums. Such programmes can make a lot of difference in the nutritional index among the poor and contribute to a sharp decline in TB prevalence.",,https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/editorial/carrying-out-campaign-against-tb-1684331172,2023-05-18 10:35:12,thefinancialexpress
835,Striking down trees to beautify a city!,"How do you beautify a city? When a city has already lost much of its charm, much of its aesthetic appeal, do you go after what remains of that charm and strike it down and inform citizens that you are indulging in that insensitivity because you love your city?

The truth is unassailable. You do not make a city beautiful by cutting down trees. And no matter how much you reassure people that new trees will replace the trees that are being brought down and so add glamour to a city which has mutated into an urban slum, no one buys that argument.

There is something disturbing about attitudes which look upon trees as the enemy. When, therefore, the trees on Satmasjid Road in the nation's capital fall prey to the whims of the Dhaka South City Corporation, one cannot but raise one's voice in loud protest. And when there is the other side of the picture, a better picture, one proffered by the Dhaka North City Corporation, you know the degree to which the DSCC has slipped.

The DNCC has taken up plans to have as many as 200,000 trees planted within its areas in the next two years. The DSCC would have done credit to itself by emulating the DNCC. Indeed, through a demonstration of judicious leadership, the DSCC could have gone a step ahead of the DNCC by promising to have 300,000 trees planted within its parameters.

Time was when Dhaka was noted for its greenery. It was an age when homes were properly homes, with large courtyards populated by gardens and fruit trees of wide-ranging varieties. It was a time when the air was pure, when the breeze was an elixir for citizens. Every locality was a delight to walk in; and every family was proud to own or inhabit a place which was a tribute to nature. Children played in the courtyard. Adults sat around wicker tables over tea and discussed the world.

This was Dhaka in the 1960s and through much of the 1970s. And then commercialism, crass in its very nature, crept in. Parents who had struggled hard to build those homes exuding comfort passed from the scene. When their children took over, those homes went into the hands of builders. And soon those homes vanished, those courtyards with the gardens and the fruit trees disappeared. Modernity in all its ugliness rushed in, to give us carbuncles in the form of flats and apartments and condominiums.

Observe Dhaka today. The trees you sat under or took shelter under from the sun or rain do not exist anymore. Manik Mia Avenue once was noted for its forest of trees. A time came when, in inexplicable imitation of cities in foreign lands, all those trees were condemned to an ignominious death simply because the road needed to be widened. There are new trees on that avenue today, but that old charm of the old trees felled by governmental fiat has not come back for us to savour.

The population of the nation's capital today stands at 25,000,000. That is mind-boggling. Worse, and predictably, all that pressure of people living in Dhaka or regularly making their way to it has thrown up casualties. In the old days, in the Mouchak area, woodlands where families took strolls in the evening were an attraction for all. Those woodlands are all gone and looking at all the business establishments there it becomes difficult for you, you who remembers those trees, to pinpoint the exact spot where all that green used to be.

Every city marrying the old with the new --- Delhi, Lahore, London, Paris, to name a few --- goes out of its way to ensure that nature is not tampered with. In Dhaka, though, we have played by a different set of rules. Our children have no parks to play in, our adults do not find a spot in their localities where they can breathe in something of the breeze, our young men and women drawn to romance have no opportunity to sit and converse in the shade of a tree.

Our urban administrators have down the years offered a multiplicity of Dhaka-friendly plans. That was wonderful, except that in almost every instance those plans have not moved into implementation mode. Open spaces have been commandeered by powerful and influential people. In certain cases, the administration itself has gone cheerfully into the business of reclaiming open fields --- because housing had become a priority. The little neighbourhood shops nestled among pristine nature have been pushed out, with supermarkets taking their place.

It is an obituary we dedicate to nature when we cut down trees, chop off the flower plants and have homes mutate into apartment complexes. The water bodies, the lakes which once defined Dhaka were its beauty. Today those water bodies are a memory; those lakes have been shrinking thanks to human predatory instincts. And yet we are told ad nauseam that everything is being done to enhance the beauty of a city gasping for breath.

Nature is being murdered beyond Dhaka as well, with fields which once gave us rice and vegetables and jute being cleared to have officers' living quarters, business establishments, colleges and universities come up. In a land limited to around 56,000 square miles, it is a sin for the proponents of development to swallow fields and streams and trees and so desecrate the sanctity of tradition.

Trees hold the soil in their grip, giving it the strength it needs. Beneath the soil, the roots of trees reach out to one another and so communicate in the matter of transferring energy to one another. Above the soil, trees are a weapon against creeping climate change. When they are cut down --- and nothing is done about eliciting public opinion on the issue --- it is an initial step into a reduction of the nature into deserts.

The beauty of a city, indeed of a village, of a country in our part of the world lies in the ubiquity of trees. Beauty is not to be had in the proliferation of eating places or stores displaying the newest fashions or flats holding nuclear families out of touch with other nuclear families.

It is through measures to conserve nature, to roll back through an expansion of a landscape of trees the heat which burns human bodies and leaves lives sizzling that a city acquires grace.

This nation is in need of laws that will prohibit a violation of nature. Any move, by individuals or groups of individuals or city corporations or governmental bodies, to cut down trees anywhere in the country must be considered a violation of the law and so must legally be proceeded against.

We cannot leave nature at the mercy of individuals whose understanding of aesthetics is badly flawed. We cannot have this country turn into a graveyard of nature.

As this season brings in monsoon, flooding and water stagnation become usual scenario. With it comes a spike in water borne diseases like diarrhoea, malaria etc. Added to this is the dengue which can become outrageous. Fingers are not to be pointed at the rain and flood but the overall hygiene management that includes waste management of the fruit debris which tend to be the breeding grounds of mosquitoes and as such the diseases like dengue.

In fact, mango skins or jackfruit or green coconut shells are the biggest breeding grounds of mosquitoes. Their concave shapes are convenient water holds. As per our undying habits, we litter away this debris after use without considering the probable hygienic hazards. The municipal authorities have greatly improved their skills and facilities to deal with the challenging task of waste management and disposal. However, by the time the waste is taken away, the mosquitoes have already made their fiesta. As a result, we see a prompt graphical elevation in the increase of dengue affected people, whether in urban or rural areas. It is no more a municipal responsibility but a national health hazard.

A similar situation is being confronted in Malaysia and Singapore recently where the popular fruit durian is said to be causing all worries. There has been a steep rise in dengue patients in Malaysia in the recent weeks, almost 200 per cent over the last year. According to media reports in Malaysia, the climate change impacts in brewing increased heat, humidity and rain patterns are propelling the huge spike in mosquito-borne dengue fever affected people. Authorities fear that with the durian season coming up in next few weeks, the situation will aggravate and become serious because a correlation has been found between dengue and thrown away durian shell after use. Despite the fact Malaysia has a developed municipal cleansing operation, worries are mounting about dealing with the durian waste and the authorities are believed to be enforcing use of shredders at household or community level so that the concave shaped shell does not become the source of Aedes breeding.

In Bangladesh too, being affected by similar climatic variations of stretched summer and rainfall, the situation should prompt proper actions. Country's noted entomologists have already predicted a manifold increase in number of dengue affected people during the upcoming months. Last year, over two hundred people died due to dengue across the country. With monsoon drawing in and a wide spate of construction activities going on throughout the country, the chances of rain water accumulation are obviously massive. Our habits and practices of littering used plastic bottles and containers already ramp up the waste sites enabling a perfect breeding ground for Aedes larvae. Added to these will be the peels and shells of mango, jackfruit, melons etc. Neither our municipalities have the required skills, capacity and facilities to deal with such a hazardous situation.

Perhaps, it is time we need to fasten our belts to face an unwarranted epidemic caused by dengue. We have all the vulnerabilities to be a dengue hotspot. While the municipal and health authorities must draw up emergency plans, there should be a massive campaign to educate people about dealing with the waste, particularly the tropical fruit shells and the plastic containers as well. All these have the lurking potentials to trap us in a worrying health situation, much like that of cholera in the past and Covid 19 in the recent years.

837,Another round of gas price hike?,"The number of non-metred household gas users is more than 250,000. They are charged Tk 990 monthly for a single burner and Tk 1,080 for a double burner. However, these domestic consumers are going to face a significant rise soon in their monthly bill as government-run Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company is planning to raise the price of gas by 47 per cent. The company has already submitted a proposal to the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission to increase the prices of both single and double burners by Tk 390 and Tk 512 respectively per month. If the proposal is accepted, the monthly bill for a single burner and a double burner will jump to Tk 1,379 and Tk 1,591, respectively.

The proposed hike, if implemented, will have an adverse impact on our everyday life. Common people have been passing their days in miseries due to inflation, and now increase in gas price will only add fuel to the fire. Instead of raising the price of gas, the authorities concerned should exercise their power to eliminate the corruption in the activities of one of our largest distributors of gas in the country, and expand domestic gas exploration activities on a large scale. If the government looks for other alternatives, it will not be necessary to raise the price of gas.

838,Keeping blood pressure in check,"Hypertension or high blood pressure is a silent killer. It is one of the major health conditions, which contributes to the rising number of premature deaths in Bangladesh. What is further worrying is that most patients with high blood pressure (reportedly 64 per cent) do not take medicine properly and regularly. Studies have shown that one should take blood pressure medication throughout one's life. But for most people it is not possible since they cannot afford its cost. And many of them stop taking medicines after their blood pressure gets normal. This increases the risk of heart attack or stroke. In this backdrop, Bangladesh has recently observed World Hypertension Day on May 17.

High stress, unhealthy lifestyle and eating habits all contribute to hypertension. However, we can significantly reduce the number of premature deaths if we can take care of our heart health and keep blood pressure in check. Those who are suffering from high blood pressure should take medicines prescribed by their physicians.

839,Spice market heats up way too early,"In keeping with the soaring trajectory of nearly all essential commodities, the prices of aromatic spices, commonly referred to as 'garam masala', have also witnessed a remarkable upsurge well ahead of the Eid-ul-Azha festival.

Cumin seeds have skyrocketed to Tk 800-900 per kilogram this week, surpassing all previous records.

A week ago, the spice was at Tk 700-750 per kilogram, whereas the current prices are nearly 100 per cent higher than those of a year ago, according to the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).

Clove and cinnamon have also experienced a substantial 8-10 per cent surge within a week, with their current prices standing at 40 per cent and 15 per cent higher respectively, compared to the corresponding period last year.

Cardamom prices have exhibited an 8-9 per cent increase in just a week, aligning with the price recorded last year.

Meanwhile, coriander seed prices have surged to Tk 260 per kilogram this week, marking an astonishing 50 per cent hike in a mere seven days, according to the TCB.

Usually, the prices of garam masala rise prior to the Eid-ul-Azha festival. However, this time, rates of such spices have surged much earlier, considering that the sacrificial festival is still one and a half months away.

Juel Rana, a grocer in Dhaka's West Dhanmondi area, reported significant increases in the prices of locally grown spices such as onion, ginger, garlic, and imported ingredients of garam masala at the Moulovibazar wholesale market.

He said cumin experienced the highest price hike during this period.

Swapan Ghosh, a trader based in Chattogram, said that all garam masala items saw an increase of Tk 60-200 per kilogram in Chaktai-Khatunganj due to lower imports.

He said that cumin, in particular, was being wholesaled at Tk 760-780 per kilogram at Khatunganj.

Meanwhile, the price of onions rose by an additional Tk 5 per kilogram and was being sold at Tk 70-80 per kilogram on Wednesday.

Ginger was being sold at its previous high of Tk 300-380 per kilogram, while garlic was at Tk 160-180 per kilogram. Green chillies remained stable at its previous high of Tk 180-220 per kilogram.

840,AL could retain popularity despite long stay in power,"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday said Bangladesh Awami League has successfully been able to retain its popularity even though it has been in power for a long time, reports UNB.

""Staying in power for a long time, very few parties or men can sustain popularity or work for the welfare of the people continuously, But Awami League has been able to do so. We've proved it,"" she said.

The premier said this when leaders of AL and its associate bodies greeted her at Ganabhaban on the occasion of her 43rd homecoming day.

On May 17, 1981, AL President Sheikh Hasina returned home from India, after nearly six years in exile, following the brutal assassination of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members by some misguided army officers on August 15, 1975.

Talking about AL's steps to establish democracy and voting rights, and reform the electoral system, Hasina said those who were once vote riggers are now vocal on democracy and voting rights in the country.

""Those who were the thieves and dacoits of votes (in the past) now want democracy and are talking about the voting rights. They were born in an illegal way. But we are to hear such words (lesion) from them,"" she said.

The AL chief asked her party men not to consider such political rhetoric seriously rather stay beside the people, work for them to change their fortune and thus maintain the public trust and confidence in their party.

""We'll have to retain the confidence of the people. The trust of the people is our only (source of) power. We've no other power except it.

She asked the party members to reorganize the party and its associate bodies stronger from the grassroots and stay alert so that the parties of terrorism, killing or war criminals can't play ducks and drakes with the fate of the people anymore.",,https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/last-page/al-could-retain-popularity-despite-long-stay-in-power-1684347323,2023-05-18 10:35:17,thefinancialexpress
841,Rain of relief in Dhaka city,"Feeling the rain: These youngsters have a fun time outside their school as they get drenched in rain after the end of morning shift in Dhaka's Laxmibazar area on Wednesday. The capital saw a heavy rain in the morning that disrupted city life in general. Though it is mandatory for the kids to change wet clothes immediately to avoid catching cold, their natural instinct to bond with nature should not be discouraged too. — FE photo by Shafiqul Alam

The rain of relief that Dhaka city witnessed on Wednesday morning is likely to continue for two more days, according to meteorologists.

Dhaka's sky was covered with clouds since morning. As the day progressed, it started raining only to give the city residents some relief from the scorching heat.

The maximum wind speed was 61 km/h. the Met office said 40 mm of rain fell in the morning.

Although the heat of the city decreased due to this rain, office-goers suffered a little.

It was seen that people going to office or various places of work suffered as rain caused traffic congestion on many city streets.

Passengers were seen at a standstill in public transport as some streets were flooded with rain.

Rain is likely to continue for the next three days, under the influence of which the mild heatwave over Rajshahi, Naogaon, Moulvibazar, Jashore and Kushtia regions may subside, said weathermen.

Earlier on May 14, winds blew in Dhaka due to the effect of cyclone 'Mocha' with no rainfall. So, the temperature did not decrease much.

Md Monowar Hossain, a meteorologist at the Bangladesh Meteorological Depart-ment, said 40 mm of rain fell from 6:00 pm on Tuesday to 6:00 pm on Wednesday.

The mild heatwave that continued for days has reduced to normal. People, especially Dhaka's residents, would feel relief from the weather, he told the FE.

Rain or thundershower, accompanied by temporary gusty or squally winds, is likely to occur at most places over Mymensingh, Dhaka, Khulna and Sylhet divisions and at many places over Rajshahi, Rangpur, Barishal and Chattogram divisions.

Even hailstorm may occur at isolated places over the country, according to the Met office weather forecast for the next 24 hours starting from Wednesday evening. Day and night temperatures may fall slightly over the country.

842,"Finance News: Latest Financial News, Finance News today in Bangladesh","Safety compliance taken in the country's readymade garment (RMG) factories, as prescribed by Accord and Alliance, has increased labour productivity while workers' efficiency is higher in big compliant units, according to a latest BIDS study.

It, however, also revealed that impacts of compliance on profit and market access are not 'significant'.

""[Though] a positive effect of compliance on real variables (labour productivity and profit) and market access was expected, results suggest an significant impact only on labour productivity,"" Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) research fellow Tahreen Tahrima Chowdhury said while presenting the study findings.

She was speaking at the second session of the two-day BIDS Research Almanac 2023 started on Wednesday at a city hotel.

Firms, which addressed a higher number of remediation measures, performed better in terms of increased labour productivity, she said, explaining that workers of the compliant firms feel safer at their factories compared to the workers of the non-compliant firms.

The compliant RMG firms might enjoy benefits of productivity enhancement in the future if they maintain the standard level of compliance, she suggested.

Since the study was done soon after implementation of compliance standards, it is unlikely to gauge the impact of safety compliance on firm performances, Ms Chowdhury said, suggesting that a several rounds of survey over time might help understand definitive impact of compliance standards on firm performances and profitability.

The study was conducted in 2019 to explore whether Accord-Alliance compliant RMG firms perform better compared to non-compliant ones, whether compliant ones with higher number of remediation measures gain more, and what the perception of workers was about the safety compliance during the period of 2014-2018.

A total of 322 firms located in Dhaka, Gazipur, Narayanganj and Chattogram were surveyed while some 179 firms participated in the compliance initiatives of any of the three initiatives, namely Accord, Alliance and National Initiative.

The rest 143 units were not inspected by any of the three initiatives.

At the same session, findings of two other reports - 'Impacts of the Russia-Ukraine War price shocks on the Bangladesh economy: a general equilibrium analysis', and 'Sustainable Financing Strategies for the SMEs: Two Alternative Models' - were shared.

Deen Islam, associate professor of the Department of Economics at Dhaka University, and Javed Hossain, assistant professor of the Department of Economics at North South University, were the discussants of the session, moderated by Sajjad Zohir, executive director of Economic Research Group.

843,DMTCL set to start MRT-5 North depot development work,"The Dhaka metro rail company is scheduled to sign a contract on land development work of MRT-5 North depot with a Japan-Bangladesh joint venture company on May 23.

It would be the first contract to start construction of the Hemayetpur-Vatara metro rail line that is planned to go through Gabtoli, Mirpur and Gulshan.

Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited (DMTCL) selected the TOA Corporation of Japan and Spectra Group of Bangladesh for the land development work of the depot at Hamayetpur.

Officials said the JV would work on soil improvement and land development of 99.25 acres of land at a cost of Tk11.89 billion, including customs duty and value-added tax.

The DMTCL selected the contractor nearly 11 months after the tender was opened on June 27 last year.

Project Director Aftab Uddin Ahmed said that though 19 tender documents were sold, only three companies participated in the bid.

The MRT 5 North line will be a 20-kilometre one and is expected to complete by 2028. It would have both elevated and underground sections with 14 stations to be developed at an estimated cost of Tk 412.39 billion.

According to the project document, the elevated 5.6km will start from Hemayetpur to Aminbazar and the 13.5km underground section will start from Gabtoli to Natunbazar. It will connect with MRT 1 through an interchange.

Like two other MRTs, the Japan International Cooperation Agency will provide a financial assistance of Tk 290 billion for the project.

844,6 cos under extended credit facility aimed at reenergising market,"Only six companies fall under the extended coverage of credit facility that has recently been revised to boost liquidity flow into stocks.

The move is expected to give new momentum to the sluggish markets.

The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) has issued an order allowing margin loans for investment in companies with price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio greater than 40 but below 50.

Earlier, the credit facility was limited to companies with P/E ratio of 40 and under.

The newly-included marginable stocks must have minimum paid-up capital of Tk 300 million and must have been listed under category 'A' for the last three years.

The companies that get the extended loan coverage are Bangladesh Steel Re-Rolling Mills, Saif Powertec, aamra technologies, Fortune Shoes, United Insurance Company, and S. Alam Cold Rolled Steels.

Their paid-up capital is between Tk 647 million and Tk 3.79 billion where the P/E ratio ranges between 40.66 and 49.7.

Only Bangladesh Steel Re-Rolling Mills (BSRM) has foreign investors who own 17.29 per cent shares of the company.

Among the companies, aamra technologies has swung on the Dhaka Stock Exchange for the last two years without getting stuck at floor.

Its share price more than doubled to Tk 56.90 between the third week of May 2021 and the first week of November last year.

Later, the stock slid to Tk 39 by November last year. It closed at Tk 37.30 on Wednesday. The company's EPS rose to Tk 1.78 in FY22, riding on cost effective operations.

BSRM with a paid-up capital of Tk 2.99 billion has been an 'A' category stock since 2018 and distributed dividends between 15-35 per cent.

The stock has been languishing at the floor price of Tk 90 since the end of October last year. Its P/E ratio remained at 40.66.

BSRM displayed a remarkable growth in profit in FY21. Its EPS rose to Tk 18.96 in FY21 from Tk 3.90 a year ago. Then EPS dropped to Tk 10.34 in FY22 due to reduced sales caused by inflation, costlier raw materials and devaluation of the local currency.

The paid-up capital of Fortune Shoes is Tk 1.71 billion and the company has been in 'A' category since 2022 distributing 10-15 percent dividends to its shareholders.

The shoe maker has been stuck at the floor price of Tk 75.70 since December 22, last year. Its P/E ratio is 46.16.

The company saw a significant growth in income in FY22 compared to the previous fiscal year. Its EPS jumped more than 50 per cent from FY21 to FY22.

Another company Saif Powertec has been in the 'A' category since 2014 distributing dividends between 10-33 per cent.

Its share price has not moved from the floor price of Tk 30.40 since November 9, last year except for in one session on January 17. Its P/E ratio stands at 43.68.

United Insurance Company with a paid-up capital of Tk 3.79 million has been in 'A' category since 2014. It has paid out dividends between 10-33 per cent. The company gave higher amounts of stock dividend than cash dividend for many years.

The stock has remained static at Tk 29.70 since November 10, 2022. Hence P/E ratio too remained unchanged at 43.68.

If the companies' recent quarterly growth performance is considered, BSRM performed best in January-March this year. It overcame loss of the previous two quarters.

The company's nine-month consolidated profit was Tk 495 million whereas it incurred a loss of Tk 1.10 billion in the first two quarters.

Aamra technologies saw a year-on-year marginal decline in profit to Tk 10.35 million in the third quarter of FY23 because of a fall in revenue and increase in financial expenses.

Fortune Shoes observed an 80 per cent year-on year fall in profit to Tk 15.36 million in the latest quarter.

Saif Powertec has not yet released its financial reports for January-March, FY23.

United Insurance saw a 29 per cent year-on-year decline in EPS to Tk 0.22 in the quarter ended in March this year.

The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) has included S. Alam Cold Rolled Steels in the list of marginable securities under the revised criteria though it has been downgraded to category B for giving less than 10 per cent dividend for FY22.

The company's paid-up capital is Tk 983.71 million and P/E ratio is 49.7.

Spokesperson of the securities regulator Mohammad Rezaul Karim said that to be considered as marginable a company must secure its position in 'A' category at present having met the other requirements.

845,NCC Bank aims to improve service quality: MD,"NCC Bank organised various events to celebrate 30th anniversary on Wednesday. Chairman of the bank Md. Abul Bashar inaugurated the anniversary programme by cutting cake. Vice-Chairman Sohela Hossain and Managing Director & CEO Mohammad Mamdudur Rashid were present on the occasion.

National Credit and Commerce (NCC) Bank Limited aims to enhance its services by cultivating an internal performance-oriented culture through the use of technology, according to Mohammad Mamdudur Rashid, the bank's top executive.

In addition to motivating the workforce, the bank, which was established in 1993, has implemented measures to expedite its retail portfolio and card-related services.

These initiatives align with the bank's broader objective of becoming one of the top banks in the country, according to NCC Bank Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Mohammad Mamdudur Rashid.

At a press briefing at NCC Bank headquarters on the occasion of the 30th founding anniversary of the bank on Wednesday, he stressed the internal culture within an institution.

""Internal culture is a driving force in any institution. We're trying to make it fair, transparent and performance-oriented. Our motto is award the best and care for the rest,"" he said.

Despite global economic volatility, rising inflation, a decrease in inward remittances, and forex dearth, the bank achieved its target and earned an operating profit of Tk 7.15 billion in 2022, said the managing director.

""Hopefully, we will continue to grow in this year as well,"" he added.

Addressing the 'relatively lower' retail portfolio of Tk 6.92 billion compared to many other commercial banks, the managing director noted that they plan to expand it based on client demand. To facilitate this expansion, the bank has already established a dedicated 'retail finance centre'.

Regarding the growing volume of NPLs (non-performing loans), Mr Rashid, a seasoned professional with 31 years of experience in finance and banking in global and local markets, explained that the Covid shocks dealt a severe blow to many of their customers. Just as the economy was rebounding, the Russia-Ukraine war created extreme volatility in the global economic order, resulting in domino effects. He cited these factors as reasons behind the increase in NPLs.

""But we have taken various steps to bring it down. The credit recovery process through the legal channel is also on. We're hopeful to control it in the coming days,"" the NCC Bank managing director said.

The volume of bad loans increased by 2.30 per cent, reaching 6.85 per cent in 2022.

To provide technology-oriented services quickly and easily to its customers, the bank has established an investment and financial innovation centre. Furthermore, the bank plans to digitise corporate banking within the next few months.

Regarding women entrepreneurs, Mr Rashid announced the bank's plan to introduce a dedicated women's unit, which will be managed by the bank's female officials.

The bank's Additional Managing Director Shamsul Arefin, and other senior executives were also present at the press conference.

Terming all sorts of extremisms, including women extremism, is detrimental to the country's development, progress and image, they unequivocally called for forging social resistance against the crime.

Time has come to unearth the existing factors behind women's involvement in extremism through in-depth research to bring a permanent solution in this field.

Police officials, academics and development activists came up with the observation while addressing the opening ceremony of a daylong workshop titled ""Factors behind Women's Involvement in Extremism in Bangladesh: Consequences and Remedies"" at Midas Restaurant in the city.

Rajshahi Metropolitan Police (RMP) organised the meeting with support of the Asia Foundation (TAF) and Manob Kolyan Parishad on behalf of the 'Police Engagement Approach for Countering Extremism (PEACE) in Bangladesh' project.

With RMP Additional Commissioner Bijoy Basak in the chair, the inaugural session was addressed by Assistant Professor Abdul Malek from the Department of English at Rajshahi College, RMP Additional Deputy Commissioner Rafiqul Alam and TAF Programme Manager Shafiul Awal.

Professor Shafikuzzaman Joarder from the Department of Sociology at Rajshahi University gave an illustration on the issue, including its background, causes and possible preventive measures in both international and national aspects.

He mentioned that radicalisation and terrorism have no link with any specific religion or ethnicity but extremism is human behaviour and spreads in different societies.

Professor Joarder said good parenting, combat domestic violence, women to women sensitization, family counseling, promoting religious and cultural leadership and empowerment can be the best way of preventing women extremism.

He also advocated for youth campaigning, motivating religious leaders, community sensitisation, peer education and increasing participation of women in the development process to reach the cherished goal in this field.

In his remarks, Bijoy Basak said the Bangladesh Police has been working relentlessly on the basis of a zero tolerance policy against the violent extremism and terrorism.

Shafiul Awal told the meeting that the PEACE Project has been working to empower law enforcement agencies to carry out counter terrorism efforts that effectively engage citizens in awareness raising, information sharing and prevention initiatives.

Around 35 persons consisting of RMP people, lawyers, religious leaders, development activists, community policing people, journalists and students joined the workshop.

They also put forward a set of recommendations through four separate group discussions to get remedies in terms of women extremism.",,https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/country/integrated-efforts-needed-to-stamp-out-extremism-among-women-1684337323,2023-05-18 10:35:25,thefinancialexpress

854,Indonesian IT minister held for graft,"Indonesian Communication and Information Minister Johnny G. Plate, center, is escorted by prosecutors following his arrest on accusation of corruption, at the Attorney General's Office in Jakarta on Wednesday — AP

JAKARTA, May 17 (AP): Indonesian authorities on Wednesday arrested the information technology minister as part of an investigation into a million-dollar corruption scandal linked to the construction of mobile phone transmission towers in remote regions.

Communication and Information Technology Minister Johnny G. Plate was arrested after showing up for questioning at the Attorney General's Office, said Kuntadi, the director of investigation at the prosecutor's office.

If he is formally charged, it may further tarnish President Joko Widodo's credibility when it comes to fighting corruption. Four other members of Widodo's Cabinet have been sentenced to prison terms in corruption cases, casting a shadow over his efforts to clean up government while he looks for a successor when his term ends in 2024.

Footage showed Plate leaving the prosecutor's office in handcuffs and wearing a detainee red vest. He did not respond to journalists' questions.

This was the third time Plate was summoned since mid-February by investigators digging deep into his supervisory role in allocation of state funds for the construction of base transceiver stations, said Kuntadi, who goes by a single name like many Indonesians.

The project was initiated at the end of 2020 to handle more than 7,900 blank spots in mobile coverage in Indonesia's outermost, underdeveloped and remote areas of Papua, Sulawesi, Borneo, Sumatra and East Nusatenggara. It's due to be completed this year, and so far, 4,200 locations have received the equipment, the ministry's data showed.

The corruption case is believed to have cost the state 8 trillion rupiah ($539 million), said Muhammad Yusuf Ateh, head of the development finance control at the prosecutor's office. He said the losses included fictitious payments for the base stations that have not been built.

Plate was apprehended along with five other suspects, including three from the private sector, after some 60 people were questioned about the procurement process.",,https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/world/indonesian-it-minister-held-for-graft-1684340378,2023-05-18 10:35:28,thefinancialexpress
855,"8 dead, thousands evacuated as floods hit northern Italy","ROME, May 17 (AFP/Reuters): Eight people have died after heavy rains caused flooding across Italy's northern Emilia Romagna region, a local official said Wednesday.

""The number of confirmed victims at the moment has risen to five,"" after two bodies were recovered by divers in the city of Forli, an official from the local authority told AFP.

Thousands were evacuated from their homes as devastating floods hit Italy's northern Emilia-Romagna region, authorities said on Wednesday, warning that worse may be yet to come.

""The rainfall is not over, it will continue for several hours,"" the deputy head of the Civil Protection Agency, Titti Postiglione, told the SkyTG24 news channel. ""We are facing a very, very complicated situation.""

Emilia-Romagna officials said three dead bodies had been found in the towns of Forli, Cesena and Cesenatico, while three people were missing.

Fourteen rivers broke their banks in the region, forcing people in cities such as Cesena to climb onto the roof of their buildings, where firefighters rescued them with helicopters or rubber dinghies.

""Do not go near the rivers. Those who live in areas close to watercourses should move to higher floors,"" regional chief Stefano Bonaccini said on Facebook.

A number of roads and rail links were blocked and the mayors of numerous towns and cities, including Bologna, urged residents not to leave their homes.

The northern city of Ravenna, close to the Adriatic coast, was also badly affected.

""It's probably been the worst night in the history of Romagna,"" Ravenna Mayor Michele de Pascale told RAI public radio, saying that 5,000 people had been evacuated from his city alone overnight.

""Ravenna is unrecognisable for the damage it has suffered.""

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her ""total closeness to the affected population"" and, writing on Twitter, said the government stood ready to provide help.

It was the second time this month that Emilia-Romagna has been battered by bad weather, with at least two people dying during storms at the beginning of May.

The torrential rains followed months of drought which dried out the land, reducing its capacity to absorb water and worsening the impact of the floods, meteorologists said.",,https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/world/8-dead-thousands-evacuated-as-floods-hit-northern-italy-1684340397,2023-05-18 10:35:29,thefinancialexpress
856,Living with HIV for over 30 years,"PARIS, May 17 (AFP): When people were diagnosed with HIV more than three decades ago, it was considered a death sentence.

But after suffering through discrimination, the loss of loved ones and brutal side effects from drugs, advances in treatment over the years have allowed millions to live with the virus.

To mark the 40th anniversary of the discovery of the virus that causes AIDS, AFP spoke to four long-term survivors about their experience.

Paul Kidd, a 59-year-old activist and lawyer who lives north of the Australian city of Melbourne, said he was first diagnosed with HIV in 1991 but had probably already had it for several years.

Although he asked for a test in 1986, he said his doctor advised against it because ""at that time there were no treatments and the political climate was very bad for people with HIV, with open calls for us to be quarantined, criminalised or otherwise mistreated"".

""My diagnosis was hard to accept but not really a surprise, as an ex-partner of mine had died of AIDS in 1988,"" he said. ""Many people I knew and loved died.""

After his diagnosis, Kidd started on an antiretroviral drug called AZT, which he said ""made me very sick"" but which he credits with saving his life. Now he takes just one daily pill with no side effects.

""One thing that hasn't changed much is HIV stigma,"" he said, particularly in some regions. ""Uganda and Ghana are going in a terrible direction, and people with HIV in Russia and Eastern Europe have a much harder life than I ever did,"" he said.

""I know I am lucky to still be alive and the volunteer work I do is my way of honouring the memory of those who aren't with us any more.""

Pascale Lassus, a 62-year-old retiree in the southwestern French city of Bayonne, said she unknowingly contracted HIV in 1984 from her then boyfriend.

She did not find out until a decade later, when she was tested after falling ill with bronchitis. ""I was stunned,"" she said. ""I had been living normally until then and my immune system went haywire.""",,https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/world/living-with-hiv-for-over-30-years-1684340412,2023-05-18 10:35:30,thefinancialexpress

Global warming set to break key limit

LONDON, May 17: Our overheating world is likely to break a key temperature limit for the first time over the next few years, scientists predict. Researchers say there's now a 66% chance we will pass the 1.5C global warming threshold between now and 2027. The chances are rising due to emissions from human activities plus the El Niño weather event expected this summer. If the world passes the limit, scientists stress the breach, while worrying, will likely be temporary. Hitting the threshold would mean the world is 1.5C warmer than it was during the second half of the 19th Century, before fossil fuel emissions from industrialisation really began to ramp up. — BBC

""England could be a possibility as a venue for the Asia Cup,"" Sethi said in an interview with an Indian media outlet.

Raja expressed his astonishment at Sethi's statement and questioned the mental stability of the PCB chief. He argued that the primary purpose of the Asia Cup, especially when held before the World Cup, is to allow teams to acclimatize themselves to the subcontinent conditions.

""I was shocked to hear the Chairman PCB saying it would be great to see the Asia Cup being played at Lord's. Is he mentally stable or not?"" Raja questioned.

""The whole point of Asia Cup before the World Cup was that the teams get familiar with the conditions of the sub-continent,"" he added.

Former PCB chairman also opened up about Sethi's earlier statement regarding the possibility of hosting the Pakistan Super League (PSL) in Dubai as a result of taxation concerns.

""Another statement that made me angry was Mr Chairman telling the press they want to organise PSL season 9 in UAE because there are issues with taxation in Pakistan,"" he said.

""At one hand you're saying that Pakistan is safe for cricket regarding Asia Cup but on the other hand you are saying that PSL should not be conducted in Pakistan, how does that make sense?"" Raja continued.

Sethi in an interview with the BBC, said, ""The first issue is in principle do you accept the hybrid model? That we play some matches in Pakistan, and most other in a neutral venue. The second issue is once you agree on that, whether we play in Sri Lanka, of in Bangladesh or in the UAE or indeed in England, that's up to the host country to decide. We are the hosts.

864,Understanding the 'Marcos Syndrome' - US-Philippines strategic cooperation,"""We are your partners. We are your allies. We are your friends,"" Ferdinand Marcos Jr ""Thank you. It's mutual,"" Joe Biden replied

Gestures from the two presidents' initial encounter on September 22 last year in New York said it all. Joe Biden and Ferdinand Marcos Jr. were seated beside each other, laughing like old pals. According to analysts, this was an indication that the new Philippine president was stitching together a new pattern of diplomacy that may tear apart his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte's tapestry of romance with China.

The US president said it was a critical relationship from their perspective and expressed the hope that they could do a lot together after Biden remarked the US-Philippine connection ""has very deep roots.""

Marcos Jr. returned the favour by stating that the Philippines, particularly, ""greatly appreciated"" Washington's contribution to maintaining peace in the region. The return of the USA-friendly policy is there, and it is called the Marcos Syndrome, which will be further elaborated on in the upcoming sections.

Meanwhile, senior Philippine and American foreign policy and defence leaders attended the 10th Philippines-United States Bilateral Strategic Dialogue (BSD) in Manila on January 19–20, 2023.

The BSD, which was first held in 2011, serves as the primary yearly forum for the two nations to discuss the full range of political, security, and economic cooperation, exchange perspectives on current issues and strategic priorities, and come up with new cooperative initiatives at the working group and senior official levels.

The topics discussed included 'Building a Stronger Partnership,' 'Sealing an Enduring Alliance,' 'Promoting An International Law-Based Maritime Order,' 'Readying for and Responding to Emerging Threats,' and 'Advancing Our Common Prosperity, Protecting Our Shared Planet.' This states the growing strategic cooperation between the two states.

However, the journey started in the 60s. The current president's father, Ferdinand Marcos Sr., has been referred to by historian Jose Antonio Custodio as an ""Amboy [America's Boy] to the end"" because of the prevalent ties between the Marcos family and the US. The Marcoses departed the Philippines amid a series of rallies in 1986 and made their way to Hawaii with the help of Ronald Reagan.

1965 was the first election of Ferdinand Marcos as president of the Philippines. He imposed martial law in 1972. It was a honeymoon period of the US-Philippines friendship. Later on, the People Power Revolution in 1986 forced him to resign, as mentioned earlier. But the legacy never died. They chose the dictator's son as president 36 years later.

Many Americans received the news of Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos Jr.'s triumph with some degree of secret resentment, including some in the US administration. But in the new era of competition with China, the US-Philippines alliance is essential to both countries' security and prosperity. Therefore on March 22, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced that four new military sites would be established in the Philippines, including one in a region that faces the South China Sea, as part of the country's Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with the US.

In addition to the five areas already allowed access by the 2014 EDCA, Marcos gave the United States access to four additional sites. This came as China asserted itself more aggressively in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan's self-government.

Amidst the Taiwan crisis and a growing polarisation for the Ukraine war, the US is readjusting its relations with older allies. The Philippines is one of the oldest in the Pacific region, while significance is on a surge due to the rise of China in the region.

Back in the '70s, the senior Marcos was a strategic ally and served the interests of US-based policies. His family's return to the administration will generate some reproduction of his ideas through Marcos Junior. That signifies the later portions, which will shed light on this issue.

Readjusting Philippine relations with the USA

Philippine President Marcos visits the US to strengthen ties amid tensions with China. The visit was started on April 30 2023. Following a recent near-collision with a Philippine coastguard vessel, the United States had urged Beijing to stop engaging in ""provocative and unsafe conduct"" in the disputed waterway. Marcos' visit coincides with this call.

Meeting US President Joe Biden at the White House on Monday last week marks the start of Marcos' four-day visit, which the Philippine president deemed ""essential to advancing our national interest and strengthening that very important alliance.""

In a pre-departure statement, Marcos declared, ""We will reaffirm our commitment to fostering our long-standing alliance as an instrument of peace and as a catalyst of development in the Asia-Pacific region.""

It shows the passion for maintaining a tie like his father. His prior visit to the US and the UN General Assembly speech emphasising a rules-based approach to maritime conflict signalled that he believes the Philippines' most important relationship is with the US.

Contrastingly, Duterte declared 'separation from the United States' in both military and economic terms, bringing bilateral relations to an all-time low. Duterte embellished this choice with a long list of personal grievances against 'discourteous' US officials. But Marcos Jr. has turned the bet on toward a pro-US vibe. He has unambiguously stated he values the country's alliance with the US and that he wants to strengthen it, in clear contrast to Duterte.

Hence, Marcos Jr. was carrying on Duterte's 'independent' foreign policy; he also sought to 'rebalance' the Philippines' relations with China and the US by trying to rekindle the partnership with Washington. Marcos Jr. was 'rebalancing' and 'recalibrating,' according to Renato Cruz De Castro, an international relations professor at De La Salle University in Manila, Duterte's foreign policy of ""friends to everyone, enemy to none.""

However, analysts are sceptical about whether Marcos Jr. will compartmentalise engagement with both the US and China, reserving security and defence with America and everything else with China, even though he is essentially pro-US and saying things that are music to the ears of the Americans. But, as the legacy portrays, he can maintain it while maintaining a stronger relationship with the US.

Balancing approach toward China

Marcos Jr. won't change what Duterte had previously done to improve commercial ties with China, but he is strengthening the alliance with the US at the same time.

Duterte was a unilateralist who initially distanced the Philippines from the US. When he took power in July, Marcos Jr. clarified that his administration would resume talks with China over railway plans and a potential agreement for oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea.

In the last hours of his presidency, Duterte abandoned these plans because he was dissatisfied with how little of the promised USD 10 billion in loans and investments had materialised from China.

Priorly, Marcos Jr.'s meeting with Biden and address at the UN made it clear to China that it cannot simply take them for granted. Renato Cruz De Castro, an international-relations professor at De La Salle University in Manila, added that Beijing is ""like a girlfriend"" courting the Philippines ""to wean us away"" from the US and that ""if China succeeds, then our value to China actually decreases"" if it does.

Here came the policies of Marcos, thriving a strengthened relationship with the US administration while not actively antagonising the Chinese administration. Because of its strategic location and the longer distance of Okinawa and Guam from Taiwan, the Philippines is important to the US because it may house US forces' advanced bases in a major conflict like the one in Taiwan.

Tensions during 'non-Marcosian' periods

The Philippines Senate rejected the renewal of the Military Bases Agreement in 1991, and US soldiers left the nation a year later as a result of a later disagreement over payments for hosting US military sites. This damaged bilateral relations. Over the next two decades, relations gradually improved before abruptly deteriorating under Duterte.

But Marcos Jr. is 'in search of a strategy' to deal with growing Chinese influence in the Philippines, made possible by Duterte's policy of pleasing China because a maritime confrontation and a rising China hemmed him in.

Before Marcos Jr. travelled to New York in 2022, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman met with him in Manila and assured him that, as head of state, he would enjoy diplomatic immunity and would not be detained for the matter if he entered the country.

Because it was the only way Marcos Jr. could actually stand on the UN stage and assume that, despite his name, it would give him legitimacy, he yearned for that immunity so desperately because they refused to pay their debt to human rights. Marcos Jr.'s statement at the UN General Assembly demonstrated that he chose to move forward rather than wallow in the past. In an era of global unrest and escalating geopolitical rivalry among the major powers, Marcos noted in his speech that the Philippines values America's stabilising role in the Indo-Pacific.

Marcos Syndrome

Many experts argue that Washington is considering deploying rocket, missile, and artillery systems in the Philippines to thwart a Chinese amphibious assault on Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory. In response to this pressure from China, defence cooperation between the Philippines and the US has accelerated, particularly through large-scale military drills and a recent increase in US access to Philippine facilities.

The base arrangement is not acceptable to China. The two parties agreed to finish a roadmap for delivering US defence aid to the Southeast Asian country over the following five to ten years in the coming months from 2022. Hence increased strategic cooperation will be experienced between the two, where the key factor is the Marcos Syndrome.

865,China hosting Bangladesh-Myanmar Rohingya talks: Is there a hope?,"After years of stalemate, Rohingya rehabilitation has again come to the forefront of the negotiations.

Since China began acting as a mediator between Bangladesh and Myanmar and is likely to do so until a solution is found, its participation in the repatriation of Rohingyas is proving to be crucial in ending the issue.

On March 10, 2023, ambassadors from eight nations, including Bangladesh, India, and China, visited Rakhine. These diplomats were sent in to demonstrate the level of readiness in Rakhine, Myanmar, for the return of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh. Around four years after the inflow of around 750,000 Rohingyas to Bangladesh due to a military campaign in Myanmar's Rakhine State in 2017, China facilitated a tripartite virtual conference, boosting hope in Bangladesh of beginning the repatriation by June this year.

Given the severe financial strain this crisis has placed on the Bangladeshi government, Dhaka is naturally desperate to start the return of the Rohingya refugees. As a result of the current global economic downturn and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Bangladesh, a country with limited resources and land, can no longer manage such a large number of displaced people.

Since the crisis' inception, China has sought a bilateral resolution rather than elevating it to a top priority in global fora. Against such a backdrop, China is bringing Myanmar and Bangladesh to the negotiation table for talks, and it is anticipated that China's strong influence on Myanmar will lead to a favourable outcome.

Repatriation before monsoon

Right before the monsoon, a test project was also considered. The rehabilitation process would be softly launched during this pilot, and any problems could be resolved. A bilateral arrangement between Myanmar and Bangladesh, brokered by the Chinese government, led to this experimental repatriation.

Initially, the agreement was made in 2018 when the three countries started having trilateral talks to advance the repatriation of Rohingya. Yao Wen, China's ambassador to Bangladesh, expressed optimism that the initial wave of migrants will return home soon. However, a group of 27 people, 20 of whom were Rohingya, traveled to Rakhine, Myanmar, recently to observe the relocation efforts for potential returns. They went to 15 communities and other Rohingya-specific facilities.

Myanmar reportedly launched this campaign mostly as a result of pressure from China. Junta representatives are visiting refugee camps to confirm the identities of people chosen for repatriation as part of a trial program mediated by China. The trial program will allow for the repatriation of 1,140 Rohingyas in total, 711 of whom have had their cases resolved. The identities and places of origin of the remaining 429 people on the list were still being vetted and confirmed.

Diplomatic triumph for Bangladesh

During her bilateral or multilateral visits, PM Hasina stated that Bangladesh had provided the Rohingyas with a humanitarian sanctuary when they started to escape Myanmar in August 2017 due to a military crackdown. Sheikh Hasina pleaded for the international community to get involved in the proceedings before the International Court of Justice, International Criminal Court, International Human Rights Court, and national courts, including supporting the Gambia in the ICJ. Bangladesh caught the international community's attention to the astonishing $1.22 billion in annual expenditures associated with housing such a sizable population of 1.2 million Rohingyas.

Since 2017, there have been discussions on the topic, but no progress has been achieved. Despite several pledges, nothing was done to make Myanmar responsible for its vow to carry out the repatriation. However, Bangladesh has successfully convinced China to step into this role to resolve the long protracted Rohingya crisis. In addition to being Bangladesh's main economic and development partner, China and Bangladesh also have close political and military ties.

Beijing officially steps into the act

As a responsible large nation, China, according to Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen, has been 'unwaveringly mediating' between Bangladesh and Myanmar to encourage the return of the Rohingya people to their place of origin. China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a close friend of Myanmar is attempting to solidify its position in the world and preserve and expand its economic and geopolitical influence over Myanmar.

Of course, China has its justifications for backing the repatriation proposal. It is in China's interests for the region to be stabilised as the northern part of Rakhine State, which served as the primary residence for Rohingya refugees, is close to the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), a network of infrastructure projects intended to connect China's Yunnan province to Myanmar's coast.

To operate all of these facilities, human resources are also required. China can train these Rohingyas and Rakhine to function effectively in various establishments and industries. In addition to preserving China's presence in the Indian Ocean, the Rakhine region is crucial for its military objectives. It is clear that the Rohingya crisis will be resolved if China takes the proper action.

Besides, China's foreign mediation efforts have seen considerable modifications in recent years. Diplomats from China are increasingly involved in conflict prevention, management, and resolution in nations including Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and Ukraine crisis. Beijing has also redirected its mediation efforts to South Asia, the Middle East, and East Africa, three areas that are crucial to the program from a strategic standpoint.

Hope rekindled again?

Bangladesh sincerely believes in China's capacity to find a long-term solution to the largest refugee problem in history. China is a trustworthy ally of Bangladesh and a powerful global player. China would act as a 'bridge of communication' and make all reasonable efforts to aid in a prompt conclusion.

China encourages Bangladesh to start the repatriation process and will continue to help the two close neighbours resolve this issue.

Given the commitment made by the Chinese ambassador, the Chinese government is seriously considering Bangladesh's worries over the safe and prompt return of more than a million displaced Rohingyas. China's engagement in this issue will serve as a paradigm for future efforts to enhance international peace, especially in view of the recurrent failures of attempts to repatriate Rohingya owing to Myanmar's blatant indifference and partially due to the insincere efforts of the international community.

Myanmar, a nation that China has tremendous influence over, has to handle the Rohingya issue. China can, therefore, significantly aid in the Rohingya's repatriation.

Although China's promise to resolve the Rohingya crisis revives a ray of hope, other global power players must recognize their collective responsibility to rise above their political differences and assist China in a long-term solution to the world's largest humanitarian crisis. However, China needs to be more pragmatic to continue its pressure on the Myanmar Junta for successful repatriation as it is impeding all the regional economic and development initiatives for collective betterment.

866,Affordable housing gap-need for financing environment,"After attaining independence in 1971 and facing hundreds of challenges, Bangladesh went through a remarkable developmental journey for the last five decades and achieved self-sufficiency in food and basic yarn production. It is also true that though Bangladesh has many successes in socio-economic arena, the 8th most populous country in the world is lagging behind to fulfill the third basic need for survival— affordable and adequate housing. Affordable housing gap is enlarging day by day due to the hike in prices of land, construction materials compared to disposable income of the people.

To understand this housing gap, it is important to know about housing scenario with its demand and supply portfolio in the country. Regarding housing structure in the country, only 11.06 per cent house-roofs are made of brick/cement, 30.50 per cent houses-walls are made of brick/cement, and a large number of households fail to enjoy sanitary toilet facilities which represent inadequate living requirements for the dwellers. The largest city in the country, the capital Dhaka stressed with over 23 million people, is one of the fastest growing (estimated 31 million people by 2035) and most densely populated (8,229 people/sq.km) mega city in the world. One-third of its inhabitants live in the slums due to lack of access of affordable and as well as adequate housing. Again, as the country is marching forward from lower middle income to higher middle-income country and per capita income is rising, middle-income class (earning between BDT 31K-99K per month) people is growing in the urban areas. A study of International Financial Corporation (IFC) states that the current demand of affordable housing is 249,000 units annually and total demand of the current market is 6 million housing units. IFC opines that it is necessary to upgrade or build 3.5 million affordable housing units immediately. It is estimated that by 2030, the projected demand will be 10.5 million units. Against the demand, annual supply of housing stock is 31.5 K units that represent only 12.65 per cent supply of the required demand and the supply gap is 87.35 per cent. Failing to meet housing demand every year, the estimated shortage will be 8.5 million houses by 2030.

Housing affordability gap in Dhaka is the second highest in the world after Lagos of Nigeria which symbolises the vulnerable condition in housing. Affordable housing gap is widening due to supply-side constraints and its underlying reasons are manifold. The prime cause of supply-side limitation is inadequacy in housing finance. IFC estimates that to meet the current demand of upgrading or building 3.5 million affordable housing units immediately, we have to channel $59 billion or 6.3 trillion BDT ($1=BDT107) for financing.

If we look into the housing finance system in the country, we find that housing finance modality is mainly debt-based representing “institutional patchworks” that comprise private sector lenders like private commercial banks, employee loans, life insurance policies, housing cooperatives and informal means as well as government-managed housing finance institution like Bangladesh House Building Finance Corporation (BHBFC) or loan programmes for government employees at low interest. National Housing Authority (NHA), Rajdhani Unnayan Kartipakkha (RAJUK), Chittagong Development Authority (CDA), Khulna Development Authority (KDA) and the 1191 member Real Estate & Housing Association of Bangladesh (REHAB) are working to improve the housing sector but their dimension is limited to certain segments of the society due to financing impediments. NHA and RAJUK’s housing and satellite town development projects are progressing very slow as well.

Debt-base mortgage markets are small (only 3 per cent), fragmented further by unorganised and the organised segments run by the commercial banks and financing institutions that only cater to the upper and middle income segments. On the other hand, mortgage finance penetration in neighbouring India is 10 per cent, and 50-70 per cent in developed countries. Apart from debt financing modality, we are also practising equity-based informal community (e.g. friends, family members/relatives and colleagues) financing for housing that is small in size and unstructured in formation. This equity-based housing finance is gaining popularity in the country where some of the like-minded people form a group and finance in purchasing land or building apartments. This form of financing poses many uncertainties and risks due to the problem of timely payment by each member, lack of skill in operation and managing fund, delays in decision making etc.

Under the situation, it is high time to devise solutions for closing this affordable housing gap. In this context, the government is the key player to close this affordable housing gap through enabling sustainable housing financing environment by preparing conducive housing policies and strategies for mobilising, prioritising and allocating capital efficiently (e.g. low cost financing), leveraging activities of the private sector, ensuring inclusive development. Bangladesh Bank may open a new window for supporting affordable housing and treat it as a productive investment to stimulate macro economy of the country. Learning lessons from global experiences and best practices might be useful in the case of policy formulation and implementing strategies regarding housing finance like PPP model, Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) etc. Asset Backed Securitisation Act, Indirect Investment Asset Management Business Act, Administration and Promotion of Real Estate Development Business Act might be enacted for the Asset Backed Securities (ABS), a leading form of structured finance widely used in developed as well as developing markets. Through implementing the above mentioned policies and strategies, we can expect to attain one of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-11) which is “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”.

867,Promoting corporate good governance in the financial sector,"This scribe recently attended an important seminar organised by the Bangladesh Institute for Professional Development and Bangladesh General Insurance Company Ltd., where a few international participants from similar organisations in India also attended. The seminar's theme was highly relevant in the context of the changing scenarios of the contemporary global financial sector. The collapse of four banks including the latest Republican Bank has been creating ripples in the global financial sector of almost all jurisdictions and questioning the very foundation of its existing governance structure. The seminar was, therefore, well-contextualised.

The governance concerns related to the financial sector and financial institutions are, no doubt, intertwined, interconnected, and overlapped with numerous macro and micro-level aspects of society. Therefore, it is virtually impossible to identify a particular issue related to the governance of the sector which could be identified as the most important one.

Yet, this scribe flagged 'customer confidence' as the most critical element of the financial sector, particularly in the present context. Here, customer confidence refers to the confidence of the society on the financial system.

Financial institutions are necessarily businesses. And these businesses, be that banks or NBFIs or insurance companies or even MFIs, must ensure that their customers and potential customers have trust on them to sustain and thrive defying the challenges.

And it is this 'trust' or 'confidence' for which corporate good governance in the financial sector is of critical importance. This is because customers and/or investors do not only consider the 'promises of benefit/return' made by the financial institutions to them, but also consider how the businesses are run and if they will sustain at all for a longer period or not.

Today's customers/investors are naturally aware (to varying degrees) that the more compliant an institution is, the more it is likely to fulfil those 'promises of benefit' made to them.

Striving for good governance with the intention of boosting customer confidence is, therefore, a 'customer-centric' approach. Indeed, the customer's trust always comes first, particularly in the financial sector.

Corporate good governance is equally important from the 'business sustainability' point of view as well. It is well established that 'good corporate governance' ensured through placing systems, controls, and processes results in long-term sustainability of the companies. This includes, in the words of Secretary General of Indian Insurance Institute Mr. S.N. Satpathy, 'corporate fairness, transparency and accountability.' This scribe would add 'social responsibility' as well. Finally, most financial institutions encounter leakages in their governance structure mainly for the lack of internal control and compliance mechanisms. This can be synonymous with lack of 'self-governance' as well.

Therefore, there is an urgency for developing well developed standards of good governance for the financial institutions during this turbulent period of global economic crisis.

In an increasingly integrated (and digitalised) financial system, risks quickly spill over across different vertical and horizontal jurisdictions of financial institutions, exacerbate through the financial system and have a contagion effect on the real sector. In fact, this cross-over of the risks from the financial to real sector landscapes can only be contained in a well-governed financial sector. And hence the need for a continuously focused monitoring by the regulators of the financial sector.

Any weakness in the governance edifice exposes the financial institutions to operational risk which quickly translate into credit, market, liquidity or reputation risk, or into a combination of all these.

Therefore, those who lead or steer or regulate financial institutions must look beyond the confines of their entity to the impact it has on the world around them.

Here, we must take a synergistic view of the relation between the financial institutions and the society at large including the real economy.

On the one hand, financial institutions need to adhere to a system of governance that fosters ethical practices so that business can thrive and sustain and on the other, the broader society (i.e., the state on behalf of the society) must instil a regulatory regime (policies and regulations) that fosters healthy competition among the financial service providers. This regulatory regime must also set and communicate to the relevant stakeholders the desired and reasonable 'ethical standards' for the financial institutions to adhere to.

Given this backdrop, financial institutions and their regulators across the globe are keen on putting in place systems, controls, and processes to ensure robust governance standards.

The primary objective of corporate governance is to safeguard stakeholders' interests in a sustained manner by ensuring that work is undertaken in a legitimate, responsible, and ethical manner. In the case of banks and other financial institutions, shareholders' interest must not, however, precede depositors' interest.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) came up with a set of 13 corporate governance principles. These provide a comprehensive guide for developing suitable corporate governance systems commensurate with the size, complexity, systemic importance, substantiality, and interconnectedness of banks and financial institutions.

The BCBS principle basically puts forward four lines of defence model to protect FIs from governance failures.

The first line comprises the day-to-day operation guidelines to prevent malpractices (e.g., management controls). The second line of defence includes the functions of a Financial Institution that ensures compliance. On top of these the 'internal audit' mechanism constitutes the third line of defence. And finally, supervision by the regulator and external audits are taken to be the fourth line of defence.

In this context, it will be interesting to see how these measures and practices can positively impact the specific FIs (including insurance companies) and how not taking these measures can put our financial system in risk which in term can hurt the macro economy itself. If the regulators were very active in monitoring the activities of the financial institutions, there would have been desired competition among these entities leading to an optimal range of returns on investment by each of them. However, it has been observed from the financial reports of the insurance companies that their returns on investment could vary from 3 per cent to 18 per cent in a single year. Does that mean that there is no competition in the sector?

It has been observed that presence of more competent independent directors who are also well compensated in vital committees like audit, risk management and if possible, the chair's position itself greatly improve customer confidence on the board and as well as the performance of the company.

Greater disclosure and redressal mechanism of complaints of the customers through a digital customer interest protection centre also improve the quality of governance and customer satisfaction. We had put in place a Customer Interest Protection Centre (CIPC) in Bangladesh Bank with a hotline. The complaints from the customers of the banking sector used to be recorded through this hotline incautiously and an Annual Report had me made on the outcomes of this intervention. This Report used to be presented in front of the stakeholders including the customers. All this enhanced the level of customer trust in the sector. It is expected that this practice is still on in Bangladesh Bank even if the size of the customer base may have significantly expanded.

Similarly, a provision of protecting the 'whistle blowers' or the presence of an ombudsman can greatly improve the confidence of the employees in a financial institution who can be motivated for more transparent and ethical operations of day-to-day businesses. It is known for sure one of the public banks in Bangladesh has been practising both innovations with a considerable positive impact on their level of performance. More could be done, if these innovations were replicated in other institutions as well.

The current paper would like to take this opportunity to point towards two governance-related issues/challenges that remain relatively less-emphasised in corporate governance discourses. This lack of attention may be especially true for Bangladesh and other developing countries.

First, is the issue of 'financial literacy'. It can now safely be argued that our financial sector has gone through a dynamic phase of progress over the last 13-14 years owing to the inclusive and digital finance drive of the central bank of the country. Yet, it must also be acknowledged that we have a lot to improve in the field of 'financial literacy'. There is certainly a huge information gap between what is available in the market and the demand side of the customers. For example, there are several green products in the market that can enjoy refinancing facilities, particularly in the MSMEs, housing, and RMGs sectors. There are low-cost long-term loans for the potential green entrepreneurs. The central bank has been providing huge refinancing support to the banks. But the mindset of the bankers remains archaic and may not feel motivated to pass the information to the potential or even existing borrowers. All this calls for massive financial literacy drive which nought to be steered by the financial regulators and top bankers. The boards of the financial institutions are also oblivious to these new products although the future businesses ought to be green and climate-friendly. For example, 80 per cent of the new proposals of energy plants during 2022 were on renewable energies. This only tells us which ways the future energy businesses will move to. However, the financial sector in Bangladesh remains bogged down with the conventional energy businesses without understanding the direction of the future businesses. So is true of digital businesses centring around artificial intelligence, large-scale data management and the surge in smaller enterprises led by women. The corporate leaders are far behind the curve with regard to these businesses of the future. Good corporate governance means creating enabling environment to embrace this future business.

Regardless of the measures we put in place to ensure ethical practices, if our customers remain less-informed about contemporary realities (i.e., new technologies, compliance requirements, etc.), we cannot expect to have a resilient low-risk financial sector in the country.

The cases of frauds related to MFS transactions (where customers give out their PINs to criminals) are testimony to this ignorance or callousness by the victims. Had we been able to properly sensitise the customers about the importance of privacy in financial transactions, the number of such fraud cases could have been much lower.

The issues related to 'financial literacy' may be of more importance for our insurance sector as well, as it is relatively less evolved (than the banking sector) and the customer base remains less aware of the benefits and procedures related to insurance.

It must be noted that the more aware our customers are, the more they will be able to hold the service providers accountable. And that will contribute significantly towards improvement of corporate good governance.

The second challenge is related to introduction of a 'fixed and straight-forward' set of guidelines for ensuring corporate governance.

Realities of the financial sector are ever changing. Introduction of new technologies in the financial system, and demand for new financial products are growing at an unprecedented level. Given this context, it is almost impossible to come up with a guideline that will cover all governance-related challenges a financial sector leader may face.

We should rather adhere to 'learning'. We must welcome what is new. Being too risk-aversive may do more damage than good. Therefore, we are to try new things cautiously and see what works and what does not.

Financial sector leaders and policymakers must ensure that existing compliance standards are maintained. At the same time, they must also remain attentive to the changing realities and emerging challenges. And they must continuously share knowledge and experiences so that everyone may work together in a coherent manner to face newer governance challenges. For that matter, involving younger generation and unserved population in financial literacy could be a prudent move. We have started a school banking programme for the students in Bangladesh Bank which now provides financial services to more than three million young bank account holders. As they become more familiar with the financial operations they not only save more (which is a medium to long-term deposit), they also can dream to become entrepreneurs after finishing their formal education. Some even can start engaging themselves as part-time entrepreneurs while studying as well.

This is where knowledge management becomes pivotal for promoting good governance. In addition, special efforts must be made to improve the quality of human resources through training and knowledge sharing between national, regional and international peers to live up to the contemporary challenges of the financial sector and the real economy. And based on such discourses our governance practices must be revisited and revised/augmented as necessary.

868,Rise of social media policing and rash behaviour,"Social media platforms have enabled us to pass our messages and opinions nationwide and worldwide. People from diverse professions post updates about their personal lives, travelling stories, cooking videos, vlogs, etc. It is often seen that a group of people freely give their opinions in the comment box of actors, actresses, celebrities, players, and influencers without any personal involvement. The comment section of such famous people keeps getting flooded with both positive and negative reviews.

Starting from actors Chanchal Chowdhury, Shakib Khan, Ananta Jalil, Arifin Shuvo, all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, singer Arnob, actresses Suborna Mostafa, Bipasha Hayat, Jaya Ahsan, Rafiath Rashid Mithila, Nusrat Imrose Tisha, Tanjin Tisha, Azmeri Haque Badhon, Nazifa Tushi, to Salman Muqtadir, Zefer, and Sabila Noor, all of the celebs are receiving tons of messages on the comment box from their fans which proves both acceptance from their audience and disapproval as well.

Recently, Shakib Al Hasan donated Tk 20,000 via The Mastul Foundation for one day's iftar to the victims of the Bangabazar fire tragedy and nominated Taskin Ahmed to do the same for the next day to continue the cycle. However, his donation post received immense backlash on social media, and people reacted sarcastically.

Even one of the victims of the fire tragedy said that he would return the donation doubling the amount of money. Can we take a moment and think about what Shakib Al Hasan, as a player, did wrong in this scenario to receive such disrespect? What could he have done instead?

Donation is something one gives away as a noble act. Hence, the amount solely depends on the giver to donate whatever amount they can. The thinking procedure of social media users of Bangladesh is questionable right here.

Actress Rafiath Rashid Mithila has constantly been facing counteraction ever since her divorce in 2017. Anything that Mithila posts on her personal or professional social platforms, be it spending quality time with her family, attending social events, signing up for films, teasers of her new films or receiving prizes for her work, a group of people never miss the chance to go and leave disrespectful comments on her posts. She's a mother, actor, development worker, and writer, pursuing PhD degree as well.

Nonetheless, she always receives criticism on her social media handles despite her work and achievements. We all have ups and downs in our personal lives; we also break relationships and move on with our lives. However, to what extent is it rational to judge someone based on their personal lives?

Social media policing didn't leave national award winner Azmeri Haque Badhon. She shared a post with her quote about how women are unsafe in Bangladesh and received personal attacking comments; for instance, how women's appearance and dress-ups are responsible for such dangers, which is largely irrational. People are praising Badhon for her achievements and for representing Bangladesh on international platforms, but she frequently receives such counterblasts on her social media handles. Can an actress not express her opinions according to her will?

Singer Xefer and YouTuber Salman Muqtadir face the same difficulties on social media. Though Xefer's latest work, 'Jhumka,' was a success, she received backlash about her appearance on her social media channels. We often forget that commenting on someone's personal preference on a public platform is gross and disrespectful.

Evergreen beauty Jaya Ahsan is loved by all. However, she has been receiving inappropriate utterances in her recent photoshoot with Swastika Mukherjee. Both senior and junior artists are supposed to receive admiration or constructive criticism based on their works rather than comments about their looks, dressings, or personal lives. Be it artists or non-artists, a group of people is always making statements or personally attacking atypical people.

Social media has clearly empowered people. Those who used to be listeners once but are now able to speak and are getting an audience also that is theoretically global.

Since one's voice can now reach a far wider audience, it inherently demands being more responsible in communication. Because everyone we may judge is facing a different reality than we are experiencing. We should never indulge in talking about people's lives based on our own philosophy and belief just because we have the technology to comment.

869,Significance of Hasina-Kishida Summit 2023 in the light of shifting global politics,"Dhaka and Tokyo have special significance and call for their own definition particularly when compared to the relationships between Bangladesh and other key nations. In fact, Bangladesh's relationships with other nations and areas have undergone significant changes because of shifting economic ties and global politics, which are strongly linked with the politics that shape national interests.

Japan has persistently supported Bangladesh's development efforts and maintained stable, cordial ties with the nation ever since Japan recognised Bangladesh as an independent nation, despite changes in the international political landscape. Dhaka was essential as a hub for connectivity and regional diplomacy.

On the flip side, after the Cold War ended, Japan pursued a more active foreign policy to take on a bigger role on the world stage, even in the security sphere. One of the manifestations of Japan’s new foreign policy is the engagement of Japan in the Bay of Bengal region. Gradually, the Bay of Bengal region has become significant for several reasons including security and geo-political ones, especially after the Ukraine and Taiwan crises. Japan aimed to do this by departing from its conventional socioeconomic diplomacy.

As indicated earlier, the ongoing Ukraine war diverts the focus of big powers away from pressing issues like solving climate change, ensuring the security of food and energy for developing countries, and triggering militarization and arms race, and polarisation.

Significantly, the crisis has given prominent players in the Global South such as Bangladesh, India, and Indonesia the chance to show that they have their own objectives in world affairs, including their numerous ideas for handling the conflict in various aspects between Russia and Ukraine.

Against such a backdrop, the upcoming visit of PM Sheikh Hasina to Japan on 25th April will elevate the geopolitical and economic significance of Japan-Bangladesh ties as well as the degree to which Japan-funded development initiatives in Bangladesh adhere to changing geo-political landscapes.

Japan’s Thrust for More Global Role

Japan's national security strategy is currently experiencing an unprecedentedly rapid historic transformation as a result of this new reality. The Ukrainian crisis prompted a prompt response from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The Research Committee on National Security of the LDP made proposals to boost Japan's defense capabilities to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on April 27, 2022. They included developing 'counterstrike capabilities' and setting a five-year goal for defense spending equal to 2 per cent of GDP.

However. In response to worries about China’s maritime ambitions, especially its pressure on Taiwan, freedom of navigation in the area, and trade issues, Japan has been working with India, the United States, and Britain to boost defense relations.

During the past few decades, Japan and South Asia have developed closer political, security, and economic ties. Most of the South Asian nations consider ties with Japan to be cordial and trustworthy owing to their long economic engagements in the region and non-hegemonic image. However, Japan on the flip side realises to accomplish the 'Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)' goal of peace, stability, and prosperity in the area, it has to expand practical cooperation with Bangladesh as a partner.

Decoding Bangladesh’s Response to Geopolitical Crises

Bangladesh is particularly entangled in the workings of geopolitics since it was born during the height of the Cold War. Bangladesh seems to have always been caught in the middle of conflicts between major powers, whether it is the competition between India and Pakistan, the Cold War conflict between the US and the former Soviet Union, or the current conflict between China and the West. Bangladesh is currently praised as a 'South Asian miracle'. Notwithstanding the difficulties that accompany economic expansion, particularly considering the enormous wealth disparity, the nation's overall economic development remains positive.

After 50 years of independence, the nation is firmly emerging from the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) category and is expected to rank among the top 25 economies in the world by 2035. Bangladesh’s influence on the global stage is growing every day as its economy soars and the balance of power shifts eastward. Throughout the past year, the majority of the Global South's nations have taken a well-considered neutral stance on the conflict in Ukraine. In that case, it is leaving Bangladesh on a tightrope, working out the next course of action while keeping in mind one's national interests.

Significance of this Visit in Changing Political Landscape

Concerns about non-traditional security have been exacerbated by the advent of artificial intelligence, e-commerce, cyber-security, hybrid warfare, climate change, and even novel viruses like the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). The ongoing geo-political crisis is adding a fatal blow to these challenges. Hence, Bangladesh-Japan relations are significant to create a win-win situation for both nations based on the convention for peace, stability, and rule-based order.

By 2021, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina wanted Bangladesh to be a middle-income nation and the goal was achieved. To that end, she is actively seeking investments in building infrastructure and development projects in Bangladesh. Bangladesh’s foreign policy has entered a new era with the implementation of the 'Look to the East' strategy. Thus, Bangladesh is trying to extract its benefits from the superpower rivalry focusing on its foreign policy dictum ‘friendship to all, malice to none.'

Bangladesh prioritises its relations with Japan, and the Sheikh Hasina government is already working together to take advantage of the many opportunities for expanding and deepening the bilateral partnership. In order to increase collaboration in the areas of food security, climate change, global health, and cybersecurity, Japan also provided concrete initiatives. Kishida stated that Japan will work with India and Bangladesh to establish the 'Bay of Bengal-Northeast India industrial value chain concept' for the development of the entire area.

Finally, Bangladesh's efforts to provide shelter and humanitarian aid to the Rohingyas from Myanmar deserve special appreciation from the world, including Japan. The Government of Japan resolved on January 28 of this year to provide the UNHCR and WFP with a total of USD 2 million for the humanitarian and protection needs of the Rohingya people on Bhasan Char. Bangladesh will leave the list of least developed nations (LDNs) in 2026 and, by accomplishing Vision 2041, hopes to become a developed nation by the year 2041.

Hence, this visit will be a reflection of Bangladesh’s seeking support of Japan as it develops and the evolving strategic partnership will create a height of bilateral cooperation.

875,Pakistan anti-graft agency that arrested Imran Khan has wide powers,"LAUNCH

The NAB began operations in 1999 under a chairman who was a former army general. It is headquartered in Islamabad, with regional offices in all major Pakistani cities.

WORKING

It is an autonomous body but analysts and politicians say that it has often been used as a tool to crack down on the opposition in the South Asian nation where the army has long held sway on who rules the country.

The agency denies any misuse of its powers.

It has its own investigators, unbridled powers of arrest as well as prison cells to hold suspects. The NAB has prosecutors and judges and runs its own courts, separate from the main judicial system.

Prime Minister Sharif was arrested by the agency and detained for several months in 2020 when he was an opposition leader in Khan's parliament.

It investigates only public office holders and government officials as per law but there have been complaints by businessmen that they have also been investigated and tried.

Investigations and subsequent trials can take months, at times years, and suspects can be locked up during that period.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/world/pakistan-anti-graft-agency-that-arrested-imran-khan-has-wide-powers,2023-05-18 10:35:39,thefinancialexpress
876,'More likely than not' world will soon see 1.5C of warming: WMO,"For the first time ever, global temperatures are now more likely than not to breach 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7F) of warming within the next five years, the World Meteorological Organisation said on Wednesday.

But that did not necessarily mean the world would cross the long-term warming threshold of 1.5C above preindustrial levels set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement.

With a 66 percent chance of temporarily reaching 1.5C by 2027, ""it's the first time in history that it's more likely than not that we will exceed 1.5C,"" said Adam Scaife, head of long-range prediction at Britain's Met Office Hadley Centre who worked on the WMO's latest Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update.

Last year's report put the odds at about 50-50.

Partially responsible for boosting the chance of hitting 1.5C is an El Niño weather pattern expected to develop in the coming months. During this natural phenomenon, warmer waters in the tropical Pacific heat the atmosphere above, spiking global temperatures.

The El Niño ""will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory"", said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas in a press statement.

Still, the likelihood of temporarily exceeding 1.5C has increased over time. Between 2017 and 2021, for example, scientists estimated just a 10 per cent chance of hitting 1.5C.

Unlike the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's climate projections which are based on future greenhouse gas emissions, the WMO update provides more of a prediction-based long-range weather forecast.

The WMO also found a 98 per cent chance that one of the next five years will be the hottest on record, surpassing 2016 which saw global temperature impacted by about 1.3C (2.3F) of warming.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/world/more-likely-than-not-world-will-soon-see-15c-of-warming-wmo,2023-05-18 10:35:40,thefinancialexpress
877,Pakistan ex-PM Khan's bail extended; supporters face trial in military courts,"Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan secured an extension to his protective bail until May 31, his lawyer said on Wednesday, as an official announced people involved in violent protests over his arrest would be tried in military courts.

Khan had been bailed by the Islamabad High Court last Friday following his May 9 arrest, which sparked violent protests across the country that killed at least eight people.

The court extended the bail, which had been due to expire on Wednesday, because the prosecutor requested more time to produce details of the case against him, Khan's lawyer Faisal Chaudhry told Reuters.

The arrest of the former prime minister, who was ousted in a parliamentary confidence vote in April last year, has deepened political instability in the South Asian nation of 220 million.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/world/pakistan-ex-pm-khans-bail-extended-supporters-face-trial-in-military-courts,2023-05-18 10:35:40,thefinancialexpress

879,Why losing the league might be the best for Arsenal,"With the clash between Arsenal and Manchester City ending up in a 4-1 defeat for Arsenal, the Premier League title is virtually settled, and City are almost certain to lift the trophy again this year.

Arsenal have been waiting 19 years for a title since their famous invincible campaign, and yet, they may be missing out on the title this year, which will be the best thing for them!

While many have been sceptical of Arsenal repeating their heroics from this year in the next season but with Mikel Arteta and co at the helm, this new generation consisting of the likes of Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka, Ben White, Gabriel Martinelli, William Saliba, and others have a higher ceiling than what this season has demonstrated.

The bulk of the Arsenal squad is under 25 years old, and they have the youngest squad in the division, which begets the question, what could this bunch do when they mature properly?

And that is exactly why they need to lose this league title. This is the first time they are facing the pressure of a title charge, and that too from serial winners Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City.

While Arsenal’s season has gone great, there are still several chinks in their armour, one of which is their lack of squad depth. Saliba’s injury has seen them drop six points in three matches and potentially the title because the Frenchman has been pivotal in the system that Arteta implies, and Rob Holding simply has not been good enough.

If they win the title, complacency might creep through the management, meaning there might not be summer reinforcements to better the squad, which will eventually be detrimental to their success in the long term.

Also, winning the league so early might hinder the growth of their young prospects, who have been brilliant thus far this season. However, a title win might trigger a feeling of their work being done, which will inadvertently hamper them from reaching their full potential.

It comes down to Arteta too. The Spaniard has been absolutely brilliant, turning jeers into cheers since his appointment. But his tactics and management are yet to cross the threshold of maturity, and a league title will not hand him that, but a crushing missing out on the league will.

All of those might not come true, and Arsenal may just go from strength to strength after winning the title, but it is undeniable that the Gunners will have several upsides to look at even if they are likely to lose the title.

Even a year ago, they were the butt of all jokes, as nobody believed Arsenal could turn things around and become a title contender. They turned the picture around and showed that the Arsenal feared around England was back.

That might not be enough for them to win the league because Guardiola has made Premier League a cakewalk, as it would be his fifth title in his seventh year in England.

However, looking at this season, Arsenal can be proud of them, whatever colour the stripes on the trophy are after the season end.

In two years, Arteta has transformed Arsenal into a winning side. And even if they don’t win the title this year, with their upward curve, it might not be long before they do.

880,Messi's return to Barcelona: A befitting final chapter of a fairytale?,"""After 21 years, I'm leaving with my wife, my three little Catalan-Argentine kids, and I can't tell you we won't come back because this is my home, and I promised my children that,"" Lionel Messi, on his dreaded departure day from Barcelona, made a promise.

And after two years, in which he has conquered his final peak and won the holy grail of football, it seems like a reality that Messi's promise will be fulfilled. Messi might just be back in the Blaugrana colours next summer.

At this point, the life of the Argentine feels like a movie script. From all the heartbreaks to eternal glory, Leo's life has panned out like a typical film protagonist; from despair, destitute, and disappointment, he has turned it around to be magical, magnificent, and marvellous.

However, there has been one thorn in these couple of years: the PSG ultras. For all the glory Messi has brought himself and Argentina, he has not been able to become 'the one' for the Parisians as they adore, expectedly, their own Kylian Mbappe more and seemingly jeer at the Argentine every time anything goes south.

On the other hand, Barcelona are still dreaming. Their President Joan Laporta, presumably, is not willing to let his legacy be the one to let Lionel Messi leave, and he has Barcelona head coach Xavi Hernandez by his side in this quest.

While the Catalans are in a comfortable lead in La Liga, their European nights have become dreaded since the little magic man left them. In both seasons, they were relegated to the Europa League and then failed to do anything substantial there too.

It has already been revealed that Xavi has been talking to Messi for some time now, and La Liga, known for their rigid financial fair play structure, is reportedly willing to loosen the grip for Messi's return because that would help their marketing cause too.

However, the season is yet to end, and Messi's return still hangs on a tight thread because of the financial mess the Catalan club are still in.

But if they somehow manage to do it, that will probably be the biggest fairytale ending in football and probably what the greatest of the game deserves.

Tears from that evening in 2021 will be a page to erase from history, and Barcelona will once again be proud of having their golden boy back, and if anybody asked about it, they never wanted him to leave and neither did he.

For now, everything is hidden in the future, although news about Messi's entourage and Barcelona being in contact has already come to light. Apparently, Messi's primary goal is to return to Catalonia next season.

Although, at this point, the Argentina skipper is willing to keep it under a shroud of mystery.

""I don't know what the future holds. I always like to fantasise about what might happen. But I really don't know what it will be. What God wants, will happen,"" he said in a recent interview.

In the movie 'The Pursuit of Happyness', when Chris Gardner finally gets the job, he breaks out crying in happiness. That was the World Cup win for Messi.

The return to Barcelona would be the cherry on the top, and the post-credits of the movie, turning Messi's life into, as Martin Scorcese says, 'Cinema'.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/sports/football/messis-return-to-barcelona-a-befitting-final-chapter-of-a-fairytale,2023-05-18 10:35:41,thefinancialexpress
881,Was sacking Julian Nagelsmann a right decision?,"Bayern Munich suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City last night. The game was the first Champions League game after Thomas Tuchel took over from Julian Nagelsmann, with the sacking of the latter being a shock for not only the pundits but also the fans.

Nagelsmann, despite having quite a shaky season in terms of the Bundesliga, was doing quite well with the team at the Champions League, winning all 8 games this season with only two goals conceded, a record of unprecedented nature for the Bayern team, who have often suffered in terms of defensive prowess in the last few seasons.

Julian Nagelsmann was the first Bayern manager in a long time who got all the reinforcements he asked for, with the last transfer window being the most significant in Bayern's history.

However, the bosses felt he didn't do enough with such a star-studded lineup, ultimately leading to his sacking. The sacking came at a crucial time of the season for Bayern, and it's directly responsible for Bayern's humiliating performance against Manchester City last night.

Thomas Tuchel, although known as a manager who gives the utmost importance to defense, had a relatively short period before acclimatizing, and this was visible in the last game with Dayot Upamecano, who has been one of the rocks of the team under Julian Nagelsmann, being responsible for two of the goals that Manchester City scored.

The team also couldn't extract the best of Jamal Musiala, the German wonder kid who has been making headlines this season with his sublime performance, as he seemed quite isolated and didn't find quite the support that he needed for Tuchel's defensive organization. It differs significantly from that of Nagelsmann and to which Kimmich and Goretzka have still not adapted themselves. Bayern's attack up front was equally clueless, with Leroy Sane and Serge Gnabry squandering a few opportunities.

It's no secret that the Bayern board has quite an issue with managers who do not comply with their exact requirements, and Nagelsmann has not been an exception to this rule. But the timing of this decision has been something that has affected Bayern the most, as it came only two weeks before the crucial match against arguably the most in-form team in the world. It is also quite unlikely that Bayern will turn the situation around after trailing like this in the second leg.

882,Is 'no Mahmudullah' the way to go?,"When the squad for Bangladesh's three-match One-Day International series came out, the big question was this, has Mahmudullah Riyad been rested or dropped?

The veteran's exclusion was later tagged as 'rest' and an opportunity to test out fringe players by the national team selectors, which made sense considering the World Cup in hindsight.

However, new questions came out. The most noticeable was that what if someone who came to Mahmudullah's place did better? And that question is legitimate, as a cricketer would not have to do much to perform much better to surpass the 37-year-old's performance in the last couple of years.

Although Chandika Hathurusinghe kind of put the cat out of the bag on Friday.

""I don't think he is past his prime. We are trying to expand our pool of players before the World Cup. If something happens close to the World Cup, we want to have enough players we have seen and can trust to do a role. (Mahmudullah) Riyad is still in the mix.""

""Riyad has done enough. He has a lot of experience. We know what he can bring. We want some other players to get up to the mark at the international level. It doesn't mean that if that guy performs well, Mahmudullah is finished. He is still in our plans,"" he said in a press conference ahead of their Ireland series.

Nonetheless, what begets all these questions is Mahmudullah's performance over the last 24 months. In this period, he has scored 807 runs in 25 innings, averaging 42.47. But at the same time, his strike rate is a lowly 71.54, way below par, considering the current ODI style.

While he has good innings even in recent times, those only look pretty on scoreboards. His innings of 77 off 96 balls surely helped Bangladesh out of trouble against India. Still, if not for Mehidy Hasan Miraz's ton, that innings would not have taken Bangladesh to anywhere substantial, let alone a match-winning score.

All of Mahmudullah's good innings in recent times have a similar pattern –play a plethora of dot balls until you reach fifty, and then accelerate to make your innings look half-decent. But if he doesn't get to fifty, that innings looks like a massive waste of balls and momentum, which often end up hurting the team severely.

Among his last six innings, he went into double digits five times. Except for that innings against India, the others are – 14 (35), 20 (26), 31 (48), and 32 (49). Combined, that's 97 runs playing 158 balls, which means his strike rate in those innings is 61.4, even lower than his strike rate over the last two years.

Add to that his fielding. While his catching standard is yet to drop much, his ground fielding and reflex have become completely unsuitable for international cricket. He often misfields, reacts to sharp chances late, and cannot cover ground space as quickly as he used to.

And the problem is that these are not just because of some lapse in fitness training. This is because age has finally caught up with him, and he is unlikely to ever return to his previous levels. These fielding issues have cost the team in runs, which he cannot cover up with the bat.

Now, either Towhid Hridoy or Yasir Ali Chowdhury will replace Mahmudullah against Ireland. Even if they don't perform with the bat, their fielding performances will definitely be better than Mahmudullah's, especially Hridoy's, who is considered to be a brilliant fielder.

While it is a big question whether such a drastic decision with the World Cup in six months, it seems like the time might just be over for Mahmudullah, and it would likely be carved in stone if either of his replacements finds the goods with the bat.

883,Tigers need 118 runs to seal T20I series against England,"A scintillating display of spin bowling from Mehidy Hasan Miraz helped Bangladesh restrict England to 117 all out in the second T20 in Mirpur.

The offspinner grabbed 4 for 12 as Bangladesh made regular inroads after Shakib Al Hasan opted to field first at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium on Sunday, reports bdnews24.com.

The Tigers were inspired in the field, holding on to catches and diving in the outfield to save runs.

A couple of 34-run stands between Phil Salt (25) and Moeen Ali (15) and Ben Duckett (28) and Sam Curran (12) gave England breathing space, but Miraz, who replaced Shamim Patwary from the first game in Chattogram, broke both the stands before it could become more threatening.

Taskin Ahmed (1-27), Mustafizur Rahman (1-19) and Shakib (1-13) bowled strictly to keep the scoring rate on a leash.

884,Djokovic crushes Norrie to reach Rome quarter-finals,"Holder Novak Djokovic powered past Briton Cameron Norrie 6-3 6-4 in a tense match to reach the Italian Open quarter-finals on Tuesday and remain on track for a seventh title in Rome.

Djokovic made slow starts to his opening two matches but the fired-up world number one quickly opened up a 3-0 lead and let slip two opportunities to break Rio champion Norrie a second time before taking the first set on serve.

The duo swapped breaks early in a spicy second set in which Norrie's overhead shot hit Djokovic on the leg after the Serbian had turned his back on the net. The 22-times Grand Slam champion continued to stare down Norrie at the end of the fifth game, reports Reuters.

An error-prone Norrie surrendered his serve again and had treatment for a right leg issue, before top seed Djokovic came from 0-30 down in the final game of the contest to complete the victory over the world number 13 on his second match point.

""So far so good,"" Djokovic, who will meet seventh seed Holger Rune in the last eight, said.

""It was an early start today. Strange conditions. I actually finished my warm-up 10 minutes before I went on the court so I was rushing a bit with everything but we couldn't play earlier because of the rain.

""I'm just glad to overcome today's challenge in straight sets and move on.""

Djokovic skipped the Madrid event due to an elbow injury and spent time getting treatment for an unspecified issue but the 35-year-old said there was no cause for fresh concern.

""Every day there's something,"" said Djokovic. ""Thankfully, I was able to play and finish the match and hopefully tomorrow I will feel even better.""

Rune battled past Alexei Popyrin 6-4 5-7 6-4 to set up a rematch of last year's Paris Masters final, where the 20-year-old Dane beat Djokovic in three sets.

Iga Swiatek continued her title defence with a 6-3 6-4 win over Donna Vekic to set up an intriguing quarter-final meeting with Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina.

Men's fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas downed Lorenzo Sonego 6-3 7-6(3) in a match postponed due to rain on Monday and plays another Italian in Lorenzo Musetti for a quarter-final spot.

Daniil Medvedev beat Alexander Zverev 6-2 7-6(3) to set up a quarter-final against Yannick Hanfmann, who came out on top 7-6(5) 4-6 6-3 against sixth seed and Monte Carlo champion Andrey Rublev.

885,Barcelona ready to do ‘everything possible’ to re-sign Messi,"Barcelona president Joan Laporta says the club is Messi's ‘home’ as they look to re-sign the forward this summer.

The Argentine's contract at Paris St-Germain expires in June, with reports linking him to Saudi Arabia, according to BBC.

But in an interview with a Spanish broadcaster, Laporta said Barcelona can compete with anyone for the 35-year-old's signature.

""History backs us, the feelings are too strong, we have 400 million fans around the world too,"" he said.

Messi left the Catalan giants two years ago after 21 years at the club but has struggled during his two seasons in France, with fans booing him after their 5-0 win over Ajaccio at the weekend.

Laporta said there had been an ""affectionate conversation"" between the two and that he congratulated Messi on winning the World Cup in Qatar last year.

""He is a Paris St-Germain player and we have to wait until the end of the season, until it is over, and then we can talk more calmly about this,"" Laporta added.

""With all due respect to Saudi Arabia, Barca is Barca, and it is home.""

The comments come after Barcelona won their first La Liga title in four years with a 4-2 win over Espanyol on Sunday.

Laporta appeared to be more reserved than during a late night Twitch stream after the win, on which he is reported to have said the club would do ""everything possible"" to sign Messi.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/sports/barcelona-ready-to-do-everything-possible-to-re-sign-messi,2023-05-18 10:35:43,thefinancialexpress
886,ICC scraps ‘unnecessary’ soft signal ahead of WTC final,"On-field umpires will no longer be required to give a soft signal before referring decisions to TV umpires, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Monday as it detailed several changes to playing conditions.

Reuters says on-field umpires would give a 'soft signal' based on their intuition when faced with a tight call, making a decision before asking the TV umpire to look at it again from different angles in slow motion.

TV umpires would uphold the soft signal decision unless they have conclusive evidence to overturn it.

The soft signal has attracted criticism in the past, with England Test captain Ben Stokes and ex-India skipper Virat Kohli calling for changes to the rule.

The rule recently came under scrutiny during a Test match between Australia and South Africa in January, in which the Proteas were denied the wicket of Marnus Labuschagne after Simon Harmer's catch was cancelled out by the third umpire despite replays appearing inconclusive at best.

""Soft signals have been discussed at previous cricket committee meetings over the last couple of years,"" said Sourav Ganguly, chair of the ICC Men's Cricket Committee.

""The committee deliberated this at length and concluded that soft signals were unnecessary and at times confusing since referrals of catches may seem inconclusive in replays.""

The ICC also said that helmets will be mandatory for ""high-risk positions"" - which include situations in which batters are facing fast bowlers, wicketkeepers are standing up to the stumps and fielders are close to the batter in front of the wicket.

The ICC's new rules come into effect on June 1, meaning it will be applied in the June 7-11 World Test Championship between Australia and India at the Oval.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/sports/icc-scraps-unnecessary-soft-signal-ahead-of-wtc-final,2023-05-18 10:35:44,thefinancialexpress
887,‘Pakistan may boycott World Cup if it loses Asia Cup hosting rights’,"There is a ""very real possibility"" that Pakistan will boycott this year's World Cup in India if they lose hosting rights to the Asia Cup, the chairman of the country's cricket board Najam Sethi said.

Bilateral cricket has been a casualty of the soured political relations between India and Pakistan over the last decade and the neighbouring countries now play each other only in multi-team events in neutral venues, reports Reuters.

India, citing safety concerns, have ruled out travelling to Pakistan for the Asia Cup in September and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has offered to let them play their matches in the United Arab Emirates in what has been dubbed a ""hybrid model"".

While the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has yet to deliver a formal response to the offer, Sethi said India wanted the entire tournament moved out of Pakistan.

That could have serious ramifications for the 50-overs World Cup in India this year as well as the 2025 Champions Trophy in Pakistan, he added.

""They want all the matches in a neutral venue,"" he said in a Zoom interview.

""BCCI should take a good, rational decision so that we don't have any problems going forward.

""India should not be looking at a situation where we end up boycotting the Asia Cup and also the World Cup, and then India ends up boycotting the Champions Trophy.

""That will be a huge mess.""

Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have also come out against playing in the UAE, citing the heat and logistics issues, heightening speculation in local media that the Asian Cricket Council may look to move the entire tournament out of Pakistan.

Sethi said that was ""not acceptable"" and reaffirmed that Pakistan may boycott the World Cup if that happened.

""That's a very real possibility, of course,"" he added.

Should India agree to the hybrid model for the Asia Cup, Sethi said, Pakistan would expect reciprocal terms for their team at the World Cup in October and November.

""We also have security concerns for our team in India,"" he said. ""So let Pakistan play its matches in Dhaka or Mirpur, or UAE or in Sri Lanka.

""This is the solution going forward, until such time that India agrees to play Pakistan, in Pakistan and outside Pakistan, bilaterally.""

BCCI Secretary Jay Shah was not immediately available for comment but neither the Indian board nor the International Cricket Council (ICC) have said they are even considering staging any World Cup matches outside India.

Sethi said Pakistan, World Cup champions in 1992, was a top cricketing nation which should not be ignored and that they would have to talk to the ICC about the Asia Cup problem.

""The ICC should step in but my sense is India would not like the ICC to step in, especially during the Asia Cup,"" he said.

The ICC was not immediately available for comment.

Pakistan was starved of international cricket after a 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore and had to lobby hard to convince top teams to resume touring the country over the last couple of years.

""We worked so hard to bring international cricket back to Pakistan,"" Sethi said.

""Every major country has toured Pakistan in the last few years. You name them, they've all been there. They all appreciated the security arrangements. That's not a problem anymore.""

Citing the hype surrounding any meeting between India and Pakistan, Sethi blamed the BCCI's ""stubbornness"" for failing to turn it into the greatest rivalry in cricket.

""The India-Pakistan game is the biggest game in town. It's bigger than Australia v England, it's bigger than India v Australia. How can we jeopardise that by a stubbornness?"" he said.

""The Indian bridge team has been to Pakistan, the Indian kabaddi team has been to Pakistan, the Indian baseball team has been to Pakistan.""

""So what's going on? Why can't the Indian cricket team come to Pakistan?""",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/sports/pakistan-may-boycott-world-cup-if-it-loses-asia-cup-hosting-rights,2023-05-18 10:35:44,thefinancialexpress
888,Bangladesh seal ODI series against Ireland,"Bangladesh have beaten Ireland by five runs in a thriller to win the ODI series 2-0 riding on Mustafizur Rahman’s brilliant last spell that brought the Tigers back in the match.

With the end of the third ODI of the series in Chelmsford on Sunday, the ICC World Cup Super League is over, leaving Bangladesh in the third position behind New Zealand and England after Ireland scored 269 for 9 in a moderate chase of 275 for a win.

After Mustafizur took three wickets in his last three overs, Hasan Mahmud claimed two in the final over, denying Ireland what could be a famous win, reports Reuters.

Needing 10 runs from that over with three wickets in hand, Ireland managed only 4 runs off five balls, losing two batsmen and making the target 6 off the last ball. Craig Young could not manage a single run off the yorker by Hasan.

Captain Tamim Iqbal brought Najmul Hossain Shanto to the attack in the 42nd over, a decision that proved right as the Tigers were without their star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan due to his injury.

Shanto sent back Harry Tector in the fifth ball and gave away only 10 runs in his three overs.

Mustafizur then put tremendous pressure on Ireland by taking three quick wickets. He had already given Bangladesh the first breakthrough in the sixth over.

Sent in to bat first, Bangladesh, who chased down 320 in 45 overs on Friday, scored at a brisk rate through the innings before Ireland fought back with late wickets at the County Ground.

Tamim smashed a half-century as a collective batting effort took Bangladesh to 274.

Mark Adair (4-40) was the tormentor in chief for Bangladesh at the death as Bangladesh lost five wickets for only 13 runs.

But Tamim (69) hit six boundaries in his 82-ball knock to craft his first half-century since Zimbabwe tour last year. He opened the innings with Rony Talukdar (4) but the debutant threw away his wicket early.

Tamim took his time to dig deep after being dropped early in the slips, but an in-form Shanto (35) got off the blocks swiftly.

He appeared to pick up from where he had left off in his century-knock on Friday and clubbed seven boundaries in a 49-run stand with Tamim.

But Craig Young (1-53) took Shanto out with a superb catch by skipper Andy Balbirnie in the slips before the left-hander could cause too much damage.

Young frequently lured the batsmen into shots and moved past the edges in a fine display of seam bowling. Spinners Andy McBrine (2-39) and George Dockrell (2-31) kept the scoring rate on a leash from either end as well.

Litton Das (35) came down the order at four and also looked to be in fine touch.

After adding 70 to the score with his skipper, Litton ended up popping up a catch at cover in an effort to up the scoring rate. As Towhid Hridoy (13) perished soon after, Tamim recklessly swung at one moving away from him to get caught.

Reduced to 186 for 5, Mushfiqur Rahim (45) took charge with Mehidy Hasan Miraz (37). The duo put on 75 off 72 balls to take Bangladesh to 261 for 5 and appeared ready for some late fireworks with more than four overs to go.

But a spectacular collapse prevented Bangladesh from playing out the last seven balls of the innings.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/sports/bangladesh-seal-odi-series-against-ireland,2023-05-18 10:35:45,thefinancialexpress
889,Messi to start for PSG after in-house suspension,"Lionel Messi will start Paris St Germain's Ligue 1 home game against AC Ajaccio on Saturday after returning to training following a club-imposed suspension, coach Christophe Galtier said on Friday.

""I spoke with him on Tuesday to see what his mindset was and I found him very determined to play... He will start tomorrow,"" Galtier told a press conference.

Messi was back in training on Monday after being suspended for making an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia and missing a training session as a result, reports Reuters.

French media reported that Messi was suspended for two weeks after making the trip when he was supposed to train with the squad the day after the Ligue 1 leaders' 3-1 defeat to Lorient last month.

Messi apologised to PSG and his team mates last Friday and was left out of the squad for their 3-1 win at second-bottom Troyes two days later.

PSG are six points clear of Lens and eight in front of third-placed Olympique de Marseille with four games remaining this season.

Messi's future at PSG has been the subject of much speculation recently, with a source close to the Argentina captain telling Reuters that he had received a formal offer to join Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal next season.

The player's focus is on winning the French title, however, Galtier said.

""He's very eager to win that title,"" the coach said.

""With him in the team we'll have to adjust compared to what we did against Troyes. Leo is Leo. I'm not going to go into statistics but when he's with us we have to strike a different balance.""

PSG's season has been well below expectations, having suffered early eliminations in the Champions League and the French Cup.

Lens will move provisionally three points behind PSG if they beat Stade de Reims at home later on Friday.

PSG have lost three of their last four home games.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/sports/messi-to-start-for-psg-after-in-house-suspension,2023-05-18 10:35:45,thefinancialexpress
890,Bangladesh seal a nailbiter to go one up against Ireland,"Bangladesh pulled off a thrilling three-wicket victory with three balls left over Ireland in the 2nd ODI of the three-match series at the County Ground in Chelmsford.

It was only the sixth time that Bangladesh chased down a total of more than 300 runs, reports UNB.

Chasing a daunting target of 320 in 45 overs— the match was reduced to 45-over a side due to a delayed start due to rain, Bangladesh rode on a brilliant century from Najmul Hossain Shanto and some late fireworks from Mushfiqur Rahim to clinch a last-over win.

In reply to Ireland’s total of 319, Bangladesh got off to a shaky start as Tamim Iqbal was dismissed for just 7 runs. Litton Das followed soon after, as he was caught by Tucker off Graham Hume for 21.

However, Shanto and Shakib Al Hasan steadied the Bangladesh innings with a 61-run partnership for the third wicket. Shakib was dismissed for 26, caught by Dockrell off the bowling of Campher. The onus came to Shanto to guide the team home.

Towhid Hridoy then joined Shanto at the crease, and the duo put on a brilliant 131-run partnership for the fourth wicket. Hridoy played a quickfire knock of 68 off just 58 balls, which included 5 fours and 3 sixes. Shanto, on the other hand, continued to dominate the Irish bowlers and scored a magnificent 117 off just 93 balls, which included 12 fours and 3 sixes. It was his maiden ton in ODIs.

However, as the target got closer, Bangladesh lost Shanto and Hridoy in quick succession, leaving them with a daunting task of scoring 34 runs off the last 3 overs. A short-ball by Curtis Campher tricked Shanto. Harry Tector slipped while bagging the catch at the deep, but he managed to hang on.

Despite losing Shanto and Hridoy in a matter of a few balls, Mushfiqur had other ideas and played a brilliant knock of 36 not out off just 28 balls, which included 4 fours, to take Bangladesh over the line with 3 balls to spare.

In the last over, Bangladesh needed five runs. Mushfiqur ducked the first two balls, and he skied a catch in the third ball, which was a no-ball. In the free-hit, Mushfiqur scooped over the wicketkeeper’s head for a four, which ensured a thrilling win for the Tigers.

For Ireland, Campher was the pick of the bowlers with figures of 2/37 off 5 overs.

Earlier in the day, Bangladesh won the toss and elected to bowl first. Ireland got off to a disastrous start as opener Paul Stirling was dismissed for a duck in the first over of the match. Stephen Doheny followed soon after, as he was caught by Mehidy Hasan Miraz off the bowling of Hasan Mahmud for 12. Skipper Andy Balbirnie and Harry Tector then stitched together a crucial partnership to steady the Irish innings. However, Balbirnie was dismissed for 42, caught behind by Mushfiqur Rahim off the bowling of Shoriful Islam.

Tector then took the onus on himself and played a blistering knock of 140 off just 113 balls, which included 7 fours and 10 sixes. He received good support from Lorcan Tucker (16) and Curtis Campher (8), but it was George Dockrell who provided the late impetus to the Irish innings. Dockrell smashed an unbeaten 74 off just 47 balls, which included 3 fours and 4 sixes, as Ireland finished their innings at 319/6 after 45 overs.

The first match of the series washed out due to rain. The third match of the series will be played on May 14th at the same venue.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/sports/bangladesh-seal-a-nailbiter-to-go-one-up-against-ireland,2023-05-18 10:35:45,thefinancialexpress
891,Busquets to leave club at end of season after 18 years,"Captain Sergio Busquets has confirmed he will leave Barcelona at the end of the season after 18 years at the club.

The former Spain midfielder, 34, has played 718 matches for Barcelona - the third-most in the club's history.

His list of honours won with the club includes eight La Liga titles, seven Copa del Reys, seven Spanish Super Cups and three Champions Leagues.

""Although it has not been an easy decision, I think the time has come,"" Busquets said.

""It has been an unforgettable journey,"" he added. ""I always dreamed of playing with this shirt and at this stadium. Reality has exceeded all my dreams.

""It has been an honour, a dream, a source of pride, and it meant everything to defend and represent this badge for so many years.

""But everything has a beginning and an end. I want to thank all the people who made this possible, from the first day to the last.""

Busquets joined the club in 2005 as a youth player, progressing to Barca's B side before making his first-team debut under manager Pep Guardiola in a 2008 league game against Racing Santander.

The defensive midfielder, who has also won three European Super Cups and three Club World Cups with the Spanish giants, is on course to end his Barcelona career with a ninth league title.

Xavi's side are 13 points clear at the top of La Liga with five games remaining.

Over his 15 years with the senior team he has scored 18 goals and provided 40 assists.

In announcing Busquets' decision to leave the Nou Camp, Barcelona described him as ""one of the best players ever to represent the club"".

892,South Africa directly qualify for World Cup after Ireland-Bangladesh washout,"South Africa have sealed the final automatic qualification spot for the World Cup after Ireland's hopes of pipping them were dashed on Tuesday when their first one-day international against Bangladesh was washed out.

South Africa played their last ODI series in the qualification period that ends this week against the Netherlands and had beaten them 2-0 to move up to eighth in the World Cup Super League.

Their hopes of playing in the tournament in India this year hinged on Ireland not beating Bangladesh 3-0 in the ODI series in Chelmsford, with net run rate also coming into play, according to Reuters.

Bangladesh, who have already qualified, set a target of 247 to win in 50 overs but the game was called off when Ireland were 65-3 in the 17th over. The innings required at least 20 overs to be completed to get a result.

South Africa join hosts India, reigning champions England, Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan in qualifying for the World Cup which begins in October.

Ireland can still qualify with two more spots yet to be decided when they play in a 10-team qualifying tournament in June-July.

893,Beefing up capacity of customs and VAT offices at ports,"Granting transit facilities to neighbouring countries, many tend to believe, without ensuring the necessary infrastructures, is like putting the cart before the horse. Transiting goods smoothly to and from any neighbouring country, be it India or Nepal or Bhutan, is only possible when the ports, both land and sea, are efficient and roads and highways are capable of withstanding the extra loads. The seaports are claimed to be ready, but how much ready will not be known before transit and transhipment become operational.

One of the important elements of transit and transhipment and tax revenue mobilisation is the facilitation of trade through ports without hassles. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) has decided to do its part. It has prepared a Tk20 billion project to strengthen the capacity of customs and VAT (value-added tax) administration. The government would seek foreign funds to bankroll the proposed project that aims at strengthening the pool of skilled manpower at the NBR, building advanced infrastructures and logistics and ensuring foolproof security in the case of transhipment of goods.

Bangladesh's external trade has been growing, in terms of both value and volume following trade liberalisation. In the event of signing free or preferential trade agreements, it would get a further boost. The existing infrastructure, logistics and skill level of the tax officials manning the customs and VAT outlets at sea or land ports are not up to the requirement. The inadequacy often leads to breach of security, VAT or duty evasion and delay in the delivery or shipment of goods. Businesses also often make complaints about delays and harassment. Moreover, the VAT and Customs houses located in the country's land and seaports are not adequately equipped with sophisticated equipment and gadgets that are in use in similar facilities in other countries. If not seaports, most land ports are said to be grossly deficient in both efficient manpower and equipment. Some even do not have enough storage facilities. Many land ports are also underutilised.

When India, in particular, will start using Bangladesh ports for transhipment and transiting a substantial volume of goods to and from its north-eastern part, not port authorities alone will have to do extra work for handling those properly. The customs and VAT offices, in addition to realising fees against the use of Bangladesh facilities, will also have to ensure non-intrusive inspection and regular surveillance of goods being transported through the Bangladesh territory. Under the proposed project, infrastructures of 17 customs and VAT commissionerate offices will be developed to facilitate business smoothly. There is also a target to impart training to some 650 officials of different levels to enable them to serve the clients better and help mobilise tax revenue in greater volumes. At the moment, a few more trade facilitation projects are under execution. The proposed one will supplement those. What will, however, be more important is the reformation of the entire tax administration to help meet the need of the time and contribute to the efforts for raising the country's tax-GDP ratio ---one of the lowest in the world.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/editorial/beefing-up-capacity-of-customs-and-vat-offices-at-ports,2023-05-18 10:35:50,thefinancialexpress
894,Mocha merciful to cause less damage than feared,"People in Bangladesh, particularly those living in the southeastern coastal areas, can now heave a sigh of relief. Belying predictions, Mocha weakened considerably at the time of its landfall on the coastline of Bangladesh with just a periphery of it sweeping across the St Martin's Island which along with the coastal tip of Teknaf bore the brunt of its ferocity. Although more than 13,000 houses including about 100 cottages were damaged in Cox's Bazar with the St Martin having the lion's share, 2,000 weak structures of those were completely ravaged. About a dozen people suffered injuries from fall of trees or their branches but no death was reported. So, there is a sense of relief from a catastrophe predicted by weather experts from home and abroad. Yet, the economic costs to families, communities and the government are expected to be quite high because of the damage to houses, disruption of power and gas supply along with the mass movement of people to the cyclone shelters and their return home.

Bangladesh could avoid the full force of Mocha because it veered off to strike Myanmar's Rakhine state near Sittwe with a maximum wind speed of 209 kilometre per hour. The cyclonic storm was much stronger when it was in the sea and gradually weakened with its radius shrinking far more than was expected at the time of its landfall. Also, the sea was on its ebb at the time. All this explains why Mocha did not wreak havoc on life and property like its predecessors Sidr and Aila. Then why did it happen? Experts believe that the persistent heat waves in central and northern Bangladesh along with most parts of Myanmar and neighbouring countries had an influence to scale down Mocha's size and power. If this is so, it is the global warming that has proved both a perpetrator and a helper in this case.

Much as this cyclonic storm may be unique in its characteristics, there is no reason to think that such storms will always spare the country like this. Factors present at the time of their landfalls decide how it will behave. So, there is no scope for laxity with preparedness. The weather forecasts were neither precise nor widely off the mark. But the local administration under the instruction of the government played its role fairly well. It is challenging to move as many as 750,000 people from their home to cyclone shelters and arrange for the logistic supports including food, water, medical and other requirements. Thanks are due to all including the volunteers.

Now that Mocha is over leaving a trail of damage and destruction, it is time for helping the most vulnerable who have suffered the worst. Their survival will be at stake if they are left to their own lot. Rebuilding their shelters and providing food until life returns back to normal will be the first task for the administration. In some cases, poor people may need financial support for managing their livelihood toolssuch as boats and nets, seeds and other agricultural inputs depending on their occupations. In short, there has to be a comprehensive rehabilitation package.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/editorial/mocha-merciful-to-cause-less-damage-than-feared,2023-05-18 10:35:51,thefinancialexpress
895,Make it a pro-farmer Boro collection drive,"To build its food grain stock, the government has started from May 7 its nearly four-month long paddy, rice and wheat procurement drive. The Ministry of Food is learnt to have offered to buy paddy at Tk 30 and partly boiled rice at Tk 44 a kilogramme (kg), while for wheat the price has been set at Tk 35 a kg. The government-fixed rates for these basic food grains this year will be higher by Tk3.0 for paddy and Tk4.0 for rice than those were during last Boro season when the campaign practically failed, especially for paddy and wheat, as the market prices for those items were higher.

The experience of the last Aman season's procurement drive cannot also be said to have been savoury given that out of the target of buying 0.3million tonnes of paddy, the directorate general of food could meet a small fraction of its target, though rice purchase could meet 86 per cent of the target (0.43m out of the targeted 0.5m tonnes). However, the government believes this Boro season's target of purchasing 1.25m tonnes of partly boiled rice and 0.4m tonnes of paddy will be successful as the prices it offered, especially for paddy and rice, are reportedly higher than those prevailing in the market. Even so, seeing that the government last year could not fulfil its target of paddy purchase, it has lowered its procurement target this year by 0.2m tonnes. In a similar vein, the procurement of 0.1m tonnes of wheat as planned this year may again prove to be harder as its present market price is higher than what the government has set for its purchase.

Going by what the food minister reportedly instructed, the farmers should be getting a fair deal from the field-level food officials while buying paddy from them. Hopefully, the minister's directive will work. For the farmers often get a raw deal from food officials not only in terms of the prices for their products, but also of the attitude with which they are often received. The problem starts when the paddy the farmers bring for sale are subjected to moisture testing. As the government has directed its officials to be uncompromising about the quality of the paddy to be purchased, especially regarding its moisture-content, it would be a real test for those officials given their colonial mindset towards farmers.

No wonder, farmers are generally reluctant to sell their products, paddy, to be specific, to the food officials to avoid the hassles like the requirement of their (farmers) having a bank account, the issue of reducing moisture content of their produce to the permissible level, let alone the official purchasing rate for paddy. Add to it the fact that food officials often buy the paddy from fariyas (middlemen) instead of directly from farmers.

Coming to the issue of rice procurement, which is generally made from millers, the government appears to have adopted a tough stance on it. As they could not supply their full contracted amount last year (they could meet only 50 per cent of the target), millers have been seriously warned against any such failure this time. Assuming that the retail price of rice will remain stable in the upcoming months, the prospect of the ongoing Boro collection drive looks optimistic.

897,NEC approves Tk 2.63 trillion original ADP for FY24,"The National Economic Council (NEC) today (May 11) approved a Tk 2.63 trillion original ADP for the next fiscal year (FY24), making the highest allocation of Tk 759.45 billion (28.88 per cent of allocation) for the transport and communication sectors.

The approval came from a meeting of the NEC held today with its Chairperson and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair.

Out of the original ADP allocation of Tk 2.63 trillion, Tk 1.69 trillion will come from local sources, while Tk 0.94 trillion, or Tk 940 billion, will come from foreign sources.

Briefing the reporters after the meeting, Planning Minister MA Mannan said that considering an allocation of Tk 116.7402 billion, the overall ADP size has reached Tk 2.7467402 trillion. The overall ADP size also includes an allocation of Tk 808.682 billion as allocation in the development assistance sector.

Out of the overall ADP allocation of Tk 2.7467402 trillion, Tk 1.7989509 trillion will come from local sources while Tk 947.7893 billion will come from foreign sources.

State Minister for Planning Dr Shamsul Alam, Planning Commission members and secretaries concerned were present at the briefing.

The number of projects in the new ADP totaled 1309 including 1118 investment projects, 22 survey projects, 80 technical assistance projects and 89 projects from the autonomous bodies and corporations.

Replying to questions of the reporters, Dr Shamsul Alam said that as per the provisional estimation of BBS, the GDP growth of Bangladesh in the outgoing fiscal year (FY23) would reach 6.03 per cent.

Besides, the rate of implementation of the ADP during the July-April period of the current fiscal year reached to 50.33 per cent with an expenditure of Tk 1.1906439 trillion.

Replying to another question, the Planning Minister said that the per capita income during the outgoing fiscal year has increased compared to the last year if it is calculated in taka.

Revealing the directives of the Prime Minister in the NEC meeting, the Planning Minister said that the Premier asked all concerned to uphold the self-respect and dignity of the country in all aspects.

Sheikh Hasina also asked all concerned to remain cautious and maintain austerity in public expenditure avoiding unnecessary spending and luxurious mindset. ""We’ll spend but we must spend where it is required,"" Mannan said quoting the Prime Minister as saying.

The Planning Minister said the premier also discouraged unnecessary foreign trips by the public servants, exploring alternate export markets since the extent of production and exportable items have increased over the years.

He said the Prime Minister expressed her satisfaction at the meeting since the size of ADP has increased compared to the last year.

The Prime Minister emphasized removing the barriers in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) side by side and directed the secretaries concerned so that the foreign loan-supported projects are implemented in a speedy manner.

Mannan said that the premier asked those ministries and divisions which have enough capacity to come up with more projects as well as directed all ministries and divisions in general to expedite their rate of implementation.

""We’ll have to spend pursuing austerity…every penny should be spent where it is necessary as per the rules and regulations and also to ensure the welfare and safety of the people,"" he added.

Asked whether the government would take projects for appeasing people ahead of the next general election, both Mannan and Dr Alam said that the government would continue to work to materialize its election manifesto. ""We’ll continue to work as per our election manifesto…we work for ensuring people's welfare,"" Mannan added.

He said that they would continue their efforts also in the next year to expedite the rate of ADP implementation.

The Planning Minister said the Prime Minister during her recent tour in Washington told the World Bank that Bangladesh would repay the loans in due time if World Bank lends more loans.

Planning Division Secretary Satyajit Karmakar said that from now on they would officially use the terms direct project loan or direct project grant instead of foreign aid.

He informed that the NEC also took a decision to reflect the investments made under the Climate Change Trust Fund in the ADP.

Satyajit said the Prime Minister asked the lagging behind ministries and divisions to put utmost efforts to enhance their capacity to implement the ADP.

He also opined that the ministries like Women and Children Affairs and Environment, Forests and Climate Change could come up with more projects.

899,ECB raises rates in inflation fight,"The European Central Bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.25% as expected on Thursday and said it would stop reinvesting cash from maturing debt in its 3.2 trillion euro Asset Purchase Programme from July.

The central bank for the 20 countries that share the euro has now lifted rates by a combined 375 basis points since last July, its fastest pace of tightening, but further action is still likely given mounting wage and price pressures.

The rate hike, a slowdown after three consecutive 50 basis point increases, comes only days after euro zone banking data showed the biggest drop in loan demand in over a decade. That suggests previous rate rises are working their way through the economy and that ECB policies are now restricting growth.

The bank, however, provided no guidance on future moves.

""The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction,"" the ECB said in a statement.

""Rate decisions will continue to be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission,"" it added.

Policymakers had been split in the run up to the meeting between a 25 basis point and a 50 basis point rise but markets and economists had overwhelmingly bet on the smaller increase after soft data in recent weeks and similar moderation by other big central banks.

Supporting the case for a smaller move, the euro zone economy barely grew last quarter and banks were tightening access to credit, raising the risk that such a trend could morph into a full-blown credit crunch and drag further on growth.

Underlying inflation has also stopped rising - at least for the time being.

Adding to the case for caution, most big central banks around the world are now moving in 25-basis-point increments after big hikes earlier, and the US Federal Reserve even signalled on Wednesday that it could pause.

""Overall, the incoming information broadly supports the assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook that the Governing Council formed at its previous meeting,"" said the ECB, which has missed its 2 per cent inflation target for the past decade.

But like peers including the Bank of England, the ECB is still seen raising borrowing costs several times before a hitting peak rate of 3.75% some time this summer, as inflation could take years to come back to its 2% target.

Although overall inflation has fallen sharply from last autumn's double-digit readings, underlying price pressures are still building, suggesting that price growth could level off above the ECB's target unless the bank hikes further.

These risks are exacerbated by a tight labour market, especially since wage growth has been quicker than predicted and the jobless rate has fallen to an all-time-low despite the near-recessionary environment.

Attention now turns to ECB President Christine Lagarde's 1245 GMT press conference.",,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/economy/ecb-raises-rates-in-inflation-fight,2023-05-18 10:35:53,thefinancialexpress

901,95-year-old US judge under pressure to step down,"Representational image.

At 95, United States Federal Circuit Judge Pauline Newman, who was appointed by president Ronald Reagan, is the oldest sitting federal judge in the US.

Now, some of her colleagues -- worried about her mental competency -- say it’s time for her to go.

But Newman is fighting back, sparking an ongoing legal fight around her refusal to step down from the lifetime post.

She filed a suit earlier this month challenging a complaint by a panel of fellow justices that she is no longer able to discharge her duties because of ‘mental or physical disability.’

Newman insisted she remains fully capable of handling cases and is as productive as other members of the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

She also accused the judicial panel seeking her removal of violating the US Constitution, which gives only Congress the power to impeach judges.

Newman has served on the court since 1984. She is a leading authority on intellectual property law, the author of rulings in several landmark cases.

But on Tuesday a three-judge judicial committee brushed aside Newman’s objections and cited several examples of what they said were her diminished capacities.

‘Multiple court staff members have reported concerns that Judge Newman cannot remember from day to day how to perform simple tasks such as logging into the computer network,’ they said.

‘Numerous personnel who interact with Judge Newman in the course of the court’s business have raised concerns about her comprehension, confusion, short term memory loss, agitation, and lack of focus,’ they added.

The panel ordered Newman to meet with a neurologist who would assess whether she suffers from a cognitive impairment and to submit to a ‘full battery of neuropsychological testing.’

It gave her until May 23 to inform the committee whether she will comply or face disciplinary action.

‘The litigants whose rights are at stake in the cases before this court deserve to have confidence that the judges ruling on their cases do not suffer from a cognitive impairment,’ it said.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201960/95-year-old-us-judge-under-pressure-to-step-down,2023-05-18 10:35:55,newagebd
902,30 Barishal journalists confined for taking photos of AL-BCL clash,"At least 30 journalists were kept confined briefly after they had taken photos of a clash between activists of the ruling Awami League and its student wing Bangladesh Chhatra League in Barishal on Wednesday night.

The confined journalists were freed following interventions by senior leaders.

The clash broke out between two factions of AL and BCL after a meeting of public representatives of Sadar upazila with Awami League candidate Abul Khair Abdullah Khokon Serniabat regarding Barishal City Corporation election on Wednesday night.

The incident happened at the residence of Juba League joint convener Mahmudul Haque Khan Mamun.

According to eyewitnesses, followers of Khokon Serniabat, Awami League leader Shahidul Islam and District Chhatra League vice-president Zobayer Abdullah Jinnah got involved in a dispute over the distribution of packets and giving speeches after the opinion exchange meeting of the AL-backed mayoral candidate.

Then, there was a scuffle between the two groups, they said.

The 30 journalists were confined by supporters of Shahidul and Jinnah, when they went there to take photos of the clash, they said and added that the situation calmed down with the intervention of senior leaders.

Azim Sharif, cameraperson of Asian Television, said, ‘BCL activists hit our cameras when we went to film the scuffle. We also had a fight over this. At one point, about 30 to 35 of my colleagues, including I, were locked in a room. Later, senior leaders of Awami League came and freed us.’

These two groups have done such things to embarrass the candidate of the boat, said AL leaders.

Jubair Abdullah Jinnah, vice-president of the district Chhatra League, said, ‘The conversation was over trivial issues and nothing else.’

Mahmudul Haque Khan Mamun, joint convener of the city unit of Juba League, said that there was a problem over trivial issues. ‘The matter was later settled.’",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201959/30-barishal-journalists-confined-for-taking-photos-of-al-bcl-clash,2023-05-18 10:35:56,newagebd
903,World's oldest near-complete Hebrew Bible sells for $38 mn,"A Hebrew Bible more than 1,000 years old sold for $38.1 million in New York on Wednesday, setting a record for the most valuable manuscript ever sold at auction.

The Codex Sassoon -- which dates to the late ninth to early 10th century -- is the earliest near-complete Hebrew Bible known to still exist.

It was sold by Sotheby's following a four-minute bidding battle between two bidders, the auction house said in a statement.

The Bible was bought by former US diplomat Alfred Moses on behalf of an American nonprofit that will gift it to the ANU Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, Israel, Sotheby's said.

‘The Hebrew Bible is the most influential book in history and constitutes the bedrock of Western civilization. I rejoice in knowing that it belongs to the Jewish People,’ said Moses, an ambassador under president Bill Clinton.

The sale surpassed the $30.8 million that Microsoft founder Bill Gates paid for Leonardo da Vinci's Codex Leicester manuscript in 1994 as the most expensive handwritten document ever sold at auction.

The most expensive historical document remains one of the first prints of the US Constitution, which Sotheby's sold for $43 million in November 2021.

The Codex Sassoon is one of only two codices, or manuscripts, containing all 24 books of the Hebrew Bible to have survived into the modern era.

It is substantially more complete than the Aleppo Codex and older than the Leningrad Codex, two other famous early Hebrew Bibles, Sotheby's said.

The manuscript bridges the Dead Sea Scrolls -- which date back as early as the third century BC -- and today's modernly accepted form of the Hebrew Bible.

It is named for previous owner David Solomon Sassoon (1880-1942) who assembled the most significant private collection of ancient Jewish texts in the world.

The manuscript was auctioned for the first time in more than 30 years and had a pre-sale estimate of between $30 million and $50 million.

The Codex Sassoon, which has moved about throughout its history, has only been presented once in the past to the public, in 1982, at the British Library in London, said Orit Shaham-Gover, chief curator of the Museum of the Jewish People.

According to carbon-14 dating, the Codex Sassoon is older and more complete than the Aleppo, written in Galilee in the 10th century and brought to Israel in the 1950s after being found in that Syrian city.

The manuscript is also considered to predate the Leningrad Codex, the oldest surviving copy of the Hebrew Bible text in its entirety, and dated to the early eleventh century.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201958/worlds-oldest-near-complete-hebrew-bible-sells-for-38-mn,2023-05-18 10:35:57,newagebd
904,Titanic shipwreck captured in first full digital scan,"The first full-sized 3D scan of the Titanic shipwreck published on Wednesday may reveal more details about the ocean liner's fateful journey across the Atlantic more than a century ago.

The high-resolution images, published by the BBC, reconstruct the wreck that lies at a depth of nearly 4,000 metres (13,100 feet) in great detail and were created using deep-sea mapping.

The luxury passenger liner sank after colliding with an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York in April 1912, leaving more than 1,500 dead.

The shipwreck has been explored extensively since it was first discovered in 1985 around 650 kilometres (400 miles) off the coast of Canada, but cameras were never able to capture the ship in its entirety.

The reconstruction was carried out in 2022 by deep-sea mapping company Magellan Ltd and Atlantic Productions, who are making a documentary about the project.

Submersibles remotely controlled from a specialist ship spent over 200 hours surveying the wreck at the bottom of the Atlantic, taking over 700,000 images to create the scan.

Magellan's Gerhard Seiffert, who led the planning for the expedition, told the BBC they were not allowed to touch anything ‘so as not to damage the wreck’.

‘The other challenge is that you have to map every square centimetre -- even uninteresting parts, like on the debris field you have to map mud, but you need this to fill in between all these interesting objects,’ Seiffert said.

The images show the wreck -- its stern and bow lying apart surrounded by debris -- as if it were lifted from the water, revealing even the smallest details, like the serial number on one of the propellers.

The new scans may shed more light on what exactly happened to the liner with historians and scientists racing against time as the ship is disintegrating.

‘Now we are finally getting to see Titanic without human interpretation, derived directly from evidence and data,’ Parks Stephenson, who has studied the Titanic for many years, told the BBC.

Stephenson said there is ‘still much to learn’ from the wreck, which is ‘essentially the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster’.

‘And she has stories to tell,’ he added.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201957/titanic-shipwreck-captured-in-first-full-digital-scan,2023-05-18 10:35:58,newagebd
905,City hit Real for four to reach Champions League final,"Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva celebrates after scoring his team's second goal during the UEFA Champions League semi-final second leg match against Real Madrid at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Wednesday. — AFP photo

Manchester City produced a stunning performance to reach the Champions League final as Bernardo Silva's double put Real Madrid to the sword in 4-0 thrashing, securing a 5-1 aggregate win for the English champions on Wednesday.

Eder Militao's own goal and Julian Alvarez's strike in stoppage time rounded off a memorable night for Pep Guardiola's men as they moved to within three wins of matching Manchester United's treble in 1998/99.

A fifth Premier League title in six seasons appears a formality with City needing just three points from their final three games, while United await in the FA Cup final on June 3.

But it is a first ever Champions League that City crave the most and they will be strong favourites to finally conquer Europe against Inter Milan in Istanbul on June 10.

Seven years into Guardiola's reign as City boss, the home fans were sent into seventh heaven by the quality of a display that rivalled the former Barcelona boss' Champions League final wins in charge of the Catalan giants in 2009 and 2011.

Madrid dashed City's dreams at this stage last season with a remarkable comeback from two goals down in the dying seconds of the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu.

But Carlo Ancelotti's men this time had no answer to City's excellence.

Were it not for Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, the defending champions would have been on the end of a hiding before half-time.

The giant Belgian needed all of his two-metre (6ft 7in) frame to claw Erling Haaland's header round the post.

Haaland had already been denied his 53rd goal of the season by Courtois with another downward header.

Rodri, John Stones and Jack Grealish also saw pot shots fly off target from the edge of the area, but Madrid's luck finally ran out on 23 minutes.

Kevin De Bruyne unpicked the lock as his pass found Silva inside the area, and he smashed high past Courtois' left hand.

The visitors had barely registered a touch inside the City half for the opening half hour, but were inches away from an equaliser 10 minutes before half-time when a piledriver from Toni Kroos rattled the crossbar.

Just as Madrid were beginning to settle, City grabbed the second goal their first half dominance deserved.

The in-form Ilkay Gundogan was denied a fifth goal in May by Eder Militao's block, but the ball looped up kindly for Silva to head into an unguarded net.

Haaland fired another blistering effort just wide and Courtois denied Silva an unlikely hat-trick as City attacks continued in waves before the break.

But they had to show a different side to their game early in the second-half to weather Madrid's reaction and ensure there was no repeat of last season's late drama between the sides.

The closest Real came to a lifeline was a dipping free-kick from David Alaba that Ederson tipped over.

At the other end Courtois continued to win his personal battle with Haaland by turning the Norwegian's shot onto the bar when one-on-one.

But City won the war to move within one match of completing a transformation in the club's fortunes since an Abu Dhabi-backed takeover in 2008.

The next blow to the Spanish giants was self-inflicted as Militao deflected Manuel Akanki's header past Courtois 15 minutes from time.

Haaland was replaced by Alvarez two minutes from the end and that was all the Argentine World Cup winner needed to make his mark as he slotted home from Phil Foden's pass.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201956/city-hit-real-for-four-to-reach-champions-league-final,2023-05-18 10:35:59,newagebd

908,Govt urged to protect fishing community’s rights,"Environmental activists on Wednesday urged the government to take initiatives to protect fishing community’s rights at a national dialogue at the National Press Club in the capital.

They made the demand at the dialogue on Coastal Hilsa and Fishing Community, organised by the Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon, the Waterkeepers Bangladesh and the Sunderbans and Coast Protection Movement.

They also demanded to establish organisations for the fishing community people at the national level to protect their rights.

BAPA president Sultana Kamal, who chaired the event, said, ‘We cannot give any positive information about the complaints made by the fishing community people. It is a failure of all concerned.’

Most of the fishing community people cannot reap benefits of the allowance cards given by the government because of irregularities, she said, adding that the government should pay more attention to social and cultural development of the people along with infrastructural development.

Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University’s Aquaculture department chair Mir Muhammad Ali said that Bangladesh ranked the 3rd in the world fishing and the 1st in Hilsa fishing.

The single contribution of Hilsa to the GDP is 12% and 80% of the world’s Hilsa comes from Bangladesh.

Citing his research information, he said, ‘Public and private activities should be carried out together, funds should be raised for livelihood improvement of the fishing community people.’

He also said, ‘Illegal establishments should also be stopped to improve the livelihood of fishing community people and resolve the crisis of Hilsa.’

BAPA general secretary Sharif Jamil wanted to know why the common people were not getting Hilsa if the production of Hilsa increased according to the government survey.

Fisheries researcher Syed Ali Azhar said that salary and emergency insurance should be arranged for the people along with preservation of Hilsa.

Speakers at the dialogue demanded to ensure adequate security to protect fishing community people from pirates and robbers.

They urged the government to ensure transparency of previous research on development projects to protect Hilsa sanctuaries and ensure the proper implementation of the protection laws enacted to protect Hilsa.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201953/govt-urged-to-protect-fishing-communitys-rights,2023-05-18 10:36:02,newagebd

910,Government must protect civilians in frontiers,"INDIA’S Border Security Force has killed one more Bangladeshi civilian in the Naogaon frontiers. The cattle trader, wounded early Wednesday after Indian guards had fired into a group of people, died in an upazila health complex. Barely two days ago on Monday morning, Indian guards killed another Bangladeshi civilian in the Naogaon frontiers. The death of unarmed Bangladeshis at the hands of Indian guards are shocking as they are, but what is gravely worrying is that Indian guards’ killing Bangladeshi civilians has continued apace, apparently without making Bangladesh authorities effectively lodge protests with India. Indian guards are reported to have so far killed at least 17 Bangladeshis in 2020. The border death at the hands of Indian guards totalled 43 in 2019, 3 in 2018, 17 in 2017, 25 in 2016 and 38 in 2015. Official Bangladesh statistics show, as New Age reported in June 2019, 302 Bangladeshis have been killed by Indian guards in January 2009–May 2019 while unofficial estimates that time put the figure of such death at 414 in 2009–2018. While all this happens, Indian authorities have come up, as New Age reported in June 2019, with a ludicrous argument, terming the death of Bangladeshi civilians at the hands of the Border Security Force as ‘unfortunate deaths of individuals.’

But why has the train of killing of Bangladeshi civilians in the frontiers by the Indian guards not stopped? People of Bangladesh have mostly all along protested against such high-handedness of India, generally and after almost every incident. They have, individually and collectively, mounted and tried to mount pressure on Bangladesh authorities and made the required noise for authorities to take up the issue with India boldly enough to stop this trend. Yet, Indians’ killing Bangladeshi civilians in the frontiers has continued when such death is not reported from India’s land border with China, Pakistan, Myanmar, Nepal or Bhutan. Why? Bangladesh authorities should owe the people an explanation for their failure to take an effective step in this regard. Border death may appear to be just numbers to authorities. But ordinary lives matter, on both the sides of the frontiers, to ordinary people. And people of Bangladesh do not, therefore, want any retribution or retaliation. But it is a fairly reasonable expectation of people that the border guards of Bangladesh would protect Bangladeshi civilians in the frontiers. Media reports of 2017 say that the Border Guard Bangladesh was then planning to recruit 15,000 personnel to add to the existing 50,000 that time. What do the Bangladesh guards do when Indian guards keep firing into civilians of Bangladesh? They are there not only to stop illegal cross-border movement and activities but also to protect the civilians with the required efficiency. The Bangladesh authorities concerned should also explain their failure in protecting the civilians.

India’s border guards earlier resolved to undertake joint efforts to end killing in the frontiers, but nothing happened. And there appears to be no reason for Bangladeshis to bank on such resolves until Dhaka takes up the issue with New Delhi with the required stringency and the political will. Bangladesh authorities must understand that their failure to stop Indian guards from killing Bangladeshis in the frontiers lies in their subservient foreign policy towards India. They must shrug off their capitualistic policy.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/108743/government-must-protect-civilians-in-frontiers,2023-05-18 10:36:04,newagebd
911,Quota-system of job distribution needs to be reformed,"RUTHLESS police action appears to have become a typical government response to any sections of the people that collectively differ with any policy of the incumbents — police actions against the university and college students, public and private, demanding reforms in the quota system in distributing government jobs being the latest example. The university graduates ready to apply for jobs often find the existing quota system a serious impediment towards getting a job on the basis of merits, for 56 per cent of the jobs are reserved for different sections of people based on various identities — gender, ethnicity and district, physical challenges and above all the descendants of the freedom fighters. While the university students have been demanding the reforms of the quota systems for quite some time, they have taken to the streets when the number of jobless among educated youths is on the rise on the one hand and various study reports and expert opinions are being published identifying the quota-system to be a major reason behind gradual deterioration of quality of the public servants on the other. Under such circumstances, any reasonable government would have taken up the issue of national interest for a sound review based on serious studies, seminar and symposium outputs and obviously public opinion. Instead, the incumbents have taken the path of silencing the vocal student demonstrations by using the inhuman police actions the way they are out to silence the opposition political camp/s protesting against the government’s autocratic practices. The banners and festoons carrying the portrait of the country’s founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman have also failed to protect the agitating students from the police batons and teargas canisters. Indeed, a typical autocratic practice.

However, the point that the governing quarters need to note is that the agitating students do not demand abolition of the quota system as such; instead they want ‘reforms’ of the system. Evidently, the students recognise the importance of the quota system as an affirmative action of the state for the marginalised sections of society. Their demand for ‘reforms of the system’ clearly suggests that they want an increased ratio in the quota system for distributing jobs on merit. This, we believe, is a rational demand, which is possible to meet, and with that comes the politically sensitive issue of the freedom fighters quota under which 30 per cent of the government jobs are reserved for the children and grand children of the freedom fighters.

It is indeed very important to reward the freedom fighters who have created the country by all possible means, patronisation of their children and grand children being one. This is, however, not less important to understand that the government should not pursue any policy that would eventually stand in the way of materialising the dreams of the freedom fighters for which they took up arms to liberate the country — the dream of developing the country in all possible directions, for which sets of meritorious and competent public servants remain an important component. We believe that the government should consider reducing the existing share of government jobs under the Freedom Fighters quota while adopting some other additional measures to compensate the descendants of the freedom fighters, and thus positively address the grievances of the new job seekers based on merit.

912,"Justice comes late, after 31 years","Now fifty five years old, with his beard gone all grey, poor farmer Abdul Kader, whose case involving smuggling remained buried in piles of pending cases for 31 years, was acquitted by the High Court on Wednesday.

After being jailed by a trial court for five years back in March 1987, he was released on bail serving a three-year term although his appeal record shows that he was still in jail.

Then a young man, Abdul Kader from Harinchandanpur of Sharsha in Jessore had appealed with the circuit HC bench of Jessore against the verdict that also fined him Tk 5,000 for smuggling six cows into Bangladesh.

The erstwhile BDR had lodged the case after they caught Kader with six Indian cows.

For 26 years Kader thought that he had served out his sentence but the High Court in a notice in November 30, 2017 reminded and asked him to appoint a lawyer as his defender Abdul Wahab had died.

Responding to the notice, Kader turned up at the High Court and sought free legal aid service from Supreme Court legal aid office.

The legal aid office appointed a lawyer to defend Kader in the High Court that acquitted him of the charge.

A bench of Justice Quazi Reza-Ul Hoque pronounced the verdict after hearing Kader’s appeal.

The judge was annoyed by the delay in disposal of the appeal against the short sentence.

SC legal aid’s lawyer Cumar Debul Dey appeared for Kader.

An emotional Kader, talking to reporters, said he had got justice, though a belated one.

He was now free of social stigma that the lower court verdict, without proper assessment of evidence, had imposed on him, he said.

913,Indian media report warrants no response: foreign ministry,"The foreign ministry said on Tuesday that Indian media report claiming smuggling of arms by Chinese boats into Bangladesh did not warrant any official response.

‘The report deserves no response,’ foreign ministry’s external publicity wing director general M Delwar Hossain told New Age on Tuesday.

A senior Bangladesh diplomat said that the report was published as a part of campaign by Indian intelligence agencies involving

Bangladesh using a section of Indian newspapers.

‘Chinese boats’ carrying arms reportedly entered coastal waters in Chittagong in December 2016 prompting the Bangladesh government keeping surveillance on a section of Coast Guard officials, according to a report published in Indian newspaper The Economic Times on March 19.

The arms were smuggled into Bangladesh through Chittagong Port area allegedly by local extremist groups and insurgent outfits in northeast India, it said.

‘Security establishments’ of India and Bangladesh were coordinating closely about the consignment which was smuggled through Chittagong port area for creating unrest ahead of the next general elections scheduled by the end of this year.

The coast guard ships were not on the coastal waters in the area when the consignment was transferred, the report claimed.

A section of the arms were also meant for India’s north-eastern states which were enjoying peace thanks to support of the Bangladesh government with handing over to Indian authorities insurgent leaders hiding in Bangladesh since 2009, the report said.

All senior officers of Bangladesh Coast Guard are brought on deputation from Bangladesh Navy, it added.

When asked about the reported surveillance involving alleged smuggling through coastal area, Inter Services Public Relation Directorate director Lt Col Alamgir Kabir said told New Age that the matter had no relation with the armed forces.

Bangladesh Coast Guard director general did not reply to e-mailed questions about the allegations involving the force.

New Age also drew attention of Bangladesh high commissioner in New Delhi Syed Muazzem Ali about the alleged transfer of arms and subsequent developments. He too did not reply.

Bangladesh high commissioner minister (press) Farid Hossain said that the high commission was aware of the report published in the Indian newspaper. ‘We have nothing to say,’ he said.

914,Follies in following in the footstep of Hindi,"A TEXT message that began my morning on Saturday was from the government system. A beep and a GovtInfo message said that the Dhaka South City Corporation — the north city corporation still lags behind — has taken up a programme named ‘Swachchha Dhaka’ on the birth anniversary of great politician Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The city corporation could clean up the dirtied places in the neighbourhood if requests are made to a number that the message provides.

The phrase that describes the programme readily rings the bell of another programme that India’s prime minister Narendra Modi launched in New Delhi in October 2014 — Swachh Bharat Abhiyan or Clean India Mission. The aim was to clean up the streets, roads and infrastructure of India’s cities, small towns and rural areas. The other aim was to eliminate open defecation through the construction of household- and community-owned toilets. The mission got going on the 150th birthday anniversary of Mohandas Karmachand Gandhi.

The programme that India launched in 2014 may have success in all these years. It is only expected that such a big programme, involving a huge amount of money, should have brought in the success that was aimed at. But when India launched the programme and its television channels started advertising it, they showed the spectacles of Gandhi, with the word ‘Swachh’ inside one glass and ‘Bharat’ inside the other.

As this was an all-India programme, television channels in all other languages may probably have aired the same promotional, designed in and dubbed from Hindi. At least television channels in West Bengal, where the state language is Bangla, did.

This reeked of a ploy of the Delhi government, which is hell bent on imposing Hindi on all non-Hindi states, much like the case of 1947–1952 when the West Pakistan-based ruling quarters tried to impose Urdu on the Bangla-speaking majority of East Bengal. The planners of the promotional did not use Bangla phrases, or from any other languages, for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan even when they were fed to people of other languages.

One assumption, or arrogance, that is at play is that the ruled would be knowing the words, if not the language, of the ruling quarters. ‘Swachh’, in Hindi, means ‘clean’. In Bangla, at least in West Bengal and at least in the case of the promotional in question, ‘swachchha’ — unlike Hindi, Bangla has an ‘a’ suffixed in pronunciation — started to mean ‘clean’ and most Bangla-speakers of West Bengal agreed to the proposition.

But in Sanskrit, where the word ‘swachchha’ has derived from, the word clearly does not mean ‘clean’, but ‘clear’. A Sanskrit English Dictionary by Monier Monier-Williams gives a series of meanings: very transparent or clear, pellucid, crystalline; bright-coloured; clear, distinct (as speech); pure (as the mind or heart); healthy, sound, convalescent (in this sense perhaps Prakrit for swastha); rock-crystal; the jujube tree; white, durva grass; a pearl; an alloy or amalgam of silver and gold; pure chalk.

The benchmark Bangla dictionary by Jnanedramohan Das, A dictionary of the Bengali language, which is said to have 36 per cent of its word coming from Sanskrit, mostly in the same spellings of Sanskrit’s and a little less in the same meaning as that, gives ‘clear; white’ crystalline; healthy’ as meanings. Bangla, which has not evolved from Sanskrit but was heavily influenced by it, in most of the cases follows what Sanskrit says as for words it has taken from Sanskrit or for words that have been Sanskritised, in spelling and meaning. ‘Swachchha’ in both Sanskrit and Bangla means ‘clear.’ Northing more than nothing less, more or less.

Even in view of such instances, many Indians who are proponents of the Hindi language believe that Hindi is closer to Sanskrit than Bangla is. This has never been the case. Bengalis need to write the Sanskrit word ‘swapna’ (dream) in a broken form, espeically in poems and songs, and they retain the ‘sw’ in the broken form ‘swapan’, almost religiously, although in both the instances the ‘w’ is silent. But in Hindi, the broken form has always been ‘sapna’, the last vowel being a long one, even in the written form. Hindi has never been a follower of Sanskrit as closely as Bangla has been.

But in Hindi, ‘swachch’ means ‘clean’, which has since October 2014 taken over the Bangla word ‘swachchha’ in meaning in the variety of Bangla spoken in West Bengal, to the consternation of some people and to the delight of many. Being in the same political entity of many languages, such instances of linguistic aggression by the language that is more powerful for reasons political and economic are nothing new. It has always so happened.

The problem has so far remained on the other side of the border in a land where people also speak Bangla. But the text message that I received on Saturday morning brings it here to. Some people in the city authorities, because of their absolute stupidity or because of their fine quality of imitating others thought it to be a way to name a campaign or programme. Here lies the problem.

With an official use of the word ‘swachchha’ to mean ‘clean’, it is highly likely that it, the meaning of ‘swachchha’ as is used in Hindi, might set in, firmly, in Bangla that we speak. There are other words in Bangla to mean ‘clean’ and there are many of them. What prompted the city authorities to use the same word that Hindi rulers of India in Delhi do to mean ‘clean’ in Bangladesh, which has for long been a different geographical and political entity?

Officials in city authorities could easily go for proper words such as ‘parichhanna’ or ‘parishkar’, both of which means ‘clean’. Very often in the morning, we come across people, both female and male, in green jackets sporting ‘parichhana karmi’ on the back. The authorities definitely wanted to mean ‘cleanliness worker,’ or ‘parichhannata karmi’, but used a phrase to mean ‘clean worker’, instead.

This is sort of a linguistic aggression of Hindi on Bangla, knowingly or unknowingly, with the authorities being in the know of it or not. It is bad if the city authorities have done it knowingly and it is worse if they have done it unknowingly. But the speakers of Bangla have never given the city authorities such a mandate to bring in such changes in the meaning of Bangla words. They must stop.

915,Waterbirds decreasing in coastal belt,"Waterbirds are struggling to survive amidst habitat loss and food shortage in country’s costal belt. The photo was taken recently in Bhola. — New Age photo

Appearance of waterbirds fell sharply in the country’s coastal belt over the last year, according the latest coastal bird census done in January.

Bird surveyors told New Age that there had been a drastic decline in waterbirds’ appearance since January 2017.

They said that they found the worrisome picture during waterbird census carried out at Bhola and Noakhali, the country’s central coastal areas in January.

During the census in January this year, a lone Spoon-billed Sandpiper, a critically endangered species, was seen at Char Ganguria, Noakhali.

The waterbird census is jointly carried out by the International Union for Conservation of Nature-Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bird Club, Bangladesh Spoon-billed Sandpiper Conservation Project, Prokriti o Jibon Foundation and the Department of Forest.

During the latest census, surveyors counted 26,525 individual waterbirds of 57 species down from 41,045 in January 2017.

At least six of the waterbird species were, at different times, declared as globally and locally threatened species.

The Spoon-billed Sandpiper remains a critically endangered species, the Great Knot -- an endangered species and Black-headed Ibis, Black-tailed Godwit, Curlew Sandpiper and River Tern continue to be nearly threatened species.

IUCN-Bangladesh chapter’s wildlife biologist ABM Sarowar Alam described the rare appearance of the Spoon-billed Sandpiper as quite alarming.

In January 2017, he said, 15 to 20 Spoon-billed Sandpipers were seen across the country’s coastal belt.

The number of the other waterbird species also declined sharply, he said.

According the latest census report, only three River Terns were spotted at Domarchar, Bhola besides 40 Great Knots that were seen at Bhola and Noakhali.

According to the report, at Domarchar 3,567 waterbirds were seen, the highest for any place across the coastal belt.

Char Mamtaz had the lowest number with 41 waterbirds of different species.

Baghmara, Char Kalokaiccha, Char Kukri Mukri and Shipchar in Bhola, once known as the heavens for a wide variety of waterbirds, now seldom see these beautiful creatures.

Habitat loss is the primary cause for the sharp decline in waterbird population, said Sarowar.

He called for further research to find out whether or not climate change induced temperatures had a bearing on the declining waterbird population.

‘Disturbance in food-chain due to climate change might also encourage the birds to migrate to elsewhere,’ he thinks.

Dhaka University teacher and president of Bangladesh Bird Club Obaidul Haque called it a matter of concern that coastal belt’s powerful people grab newly formed shoals, that often remain submerged, to turn them into grazing ground for their cattle, especially buffalos.

Obaid demanded holding thorough research to find out the impact of coastal afforestation for the faster reclamation of submerged shoals on waterbirds as small fish, mud insects and hydro planktons, waterbirds’ favourite food, thrive only in the muds of submerged shoals.

Sk Ahiul Islam, a recently retired coastal division officer of Bangladesh Forest Research Institute, admitted that transforming muddy shoals to pasture disturbs waterbirds’ quiet habitats.

Increased salinity hampers waterbirds’ food-chains forcing them to migrate.

DoF’s Wildlife and Nature Conservation Circle conservator Jahidul Kabir said, ‘More

research should be done to find out the actual cause of decline in waterbird population.’

916,"Not for anyone to walk dully along, and away","DISTURBING postings that did the rounds mostly on social networking sites in the evening of Wednesday — just after the ruling Awami League finished holding a rally in Suhrawardy Udyan marking the March 7 speech of Bangladesh’s founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman — narrated how some people, supposedly on their return from the rally, sexually harassed some girls. Such harassment of girls is unpalatable.

At least 10 of the girls, who were harassed, ventured in public Facebook postings to describe the incidents — how they came to be molested, taunted and teased. They described what they wished to do and what they could, and did, not do because of their helplessness or because of the persuasion by others standing by. One of them narrated how the marauding few, while harassing her, tried to video the incident and how a police officer saved her from a group of molesters and how she was sent to safety in a bus. Severely traumatised, the girl, who later took away her posting from public view to avoid nuisance, said that she would not stay in this country.

Although she said that she could return home safe in a public bus, a recent study shows that pubic transports in Dhaka are even not safe for girls and women. About 47 out of 50 women who travel in public transports in Bangladesh are found to have been sexually harassed, verbally, physically, or in other forms.

While the sexual harassment of women continues to happen and continues to be under-reported mostly because of the social stigma that goes, illogically though, with it, more so in a patriarchal society such as ours, the issue seems not to have been adequately attended to, by individuals, by society or by the government, which is grievously at fault being the manager of the state.

Yet, the most disturbing of the incidents in recent past was the sexual harassment of about 20 girls and women by some 30 to 40 rowdy young people near the gate to Suhrawardy Udyan at the 1422 Bangla New year celebrations of Pahela Baishakh in 2015. There were witnesses to the strings of incidents, there was video footage and a few venturing out to protect the girls and women were severely roughed up. Yet the investigation fell through.

Women coming to be sexually harassed was also reported when revellers had roaring celebrations of Bangladesh’s winning the ICC Trophy in 1997, which was the biggest push for Tigers on their way to beat Pakistan and Scotland in the 1999 World Cup. A few of the girls, thus harassed that time, standing in the middle of the road swore at the revellers, cursed them and wished, loudly, so that such a win that could mean indignity to women would never happen.

Events, or crimes, such as this have been taking place, all along, on a large, or small, scale. Every such occasion invariably whips along a furore, a public outcry, which dies down after a short or a long while. And the crimes recur again.

The public outcry, which now generally does the rounds on social networking sites, has failed to stop such crimes just because, as is the case with social networking sites as it is with the media, new issues surface, new crimes take place, offering something new for the media — print, electronic or social — to remain busy with for some more days. The public outcry has almost always been not loud enough to make the government stop such crimes, to make society feel bad about such crimes for long and to make individuals repent in the pain of not being able to do enough.

Whenever such crimes take place, the knee-jerk reaction of the authorities, supposedly in charge of looking after the issues — the government, the law enforcement agencies, society, family and, even, individuals — is to find fault with the people who are wronged. Instituting the cause of the crimes in the people thus wronged gives an easy way out for them. This also allows the authorities to wash their hands of the matter and mind other business of theirs.

In cases of the sexual harassment of girls and women, it is the girls or the women who first come to be examined, in how they dress, how they walk, how they talk and if there are any elements in them to lure the boys or men to indulge into such acts that they think are wrongly called crimes. This attitude is typical of the all authorities and is a great obstacles to resolving the problems.

Crimes must primarily be viewed as crimes, without any bells and trinkets. It is almost impossible to stop crimes as long as crimes are not singularly viewed as crimes. Any other considerations bring in justifications, which a justice dispensation system cannot afford. And if it so does, it does injustice to the system and humanity.

Authorities not acting adequately against such issues over the years has brought in a culture of impunity, which is buttressed more by the class of the powerful — political, economic or majoritarian — rather than the patriarchal mentality that society has yet to slough off. But patriarchy is no less to blame. Or, so to say, patriarchy and the culture of impunity borne out of political, economic and majoritarian power have always been hand in glove as all evil powers are.

There is another issue that has also been at play — viewing women as women and not as humans, often referred to as the weaker or the fair sex. below the vainglorious masculinity, although recent research, by Duke University in North Carolina, has shown that in times of famine, epidemic and hardship over the past 250 years, women, who may not be as strong physically as men are, have consistently outlived men.

The problem becomes grave enough even after this when society, family and individuals collectively start accepting such propositions about any impropriety that women may have in crimes of sexual harassment and the glory of masculinity. A remedy to such mentality, an opposition to such crimes and an antidote to such a situation must come from within the state, society, family and individuals.

But when will that happen? After every family may have at least one woman to have thus been harassed? It is better to make noise, louder enough to have a lasting effect, against wrongs at others being wronged in the slightest rather than after, or until, being wronged. The pain, the scar and the fearful situation that crimes of sexual harassment push women into have always been there. Only people have never been louder enough about this. It is, therefore, not time, for the government, for society, for family or for individuals who constitute family, society and the government, to walk dully along, and away, with every such incident taking place within the reach of conscience.

917,"New, outlying district public univs failing to woo students","Comparatively new public universities as well as those outside Dhaka are failing to woo students for their poor performance due mainly to shortage of teacher and infrastructure.

The number of vacant seats at these universities, mostly at the new ones and those in the outlying districts, tripled in the last three years.

According to University Grants Commission, about 4,100 honours and post-graduation level seats were vacant in 2016-2017 sessions in public universities — an increase by three times from 1615 seats vacant in 2014-15 session.

Against this backdrop, another 11 new public universities are in the pipeline and of them 10 are in the outlying districts.

Academicians have blamed hasty and unplanned opening of higher seats of learning without creating the needed infrastructure and recruiting required number of teachers.

‘Students and their guardians do not prefer the new universities as well as those in outlying districts as these institutions have failed to earn their confidence,’ Dhaka University professor emeritus Serajul Islam Choudhury said.

‘Most of the new universities do not have adequate number of teachers, library, laboratories and dormitories,’ he said.

Former UGC chairman AK Azad Chowdhury also cited inadequate teacher and infrastructure for these universities’ failure to attract students.

Guardians do not feel confident about sending their children to the universities outside Dhaka and those which are comparatively new, says UGC chairman professor Abdul Mannan.

The latest UGC annual report, placed at parliament in second week of February, shows that in 2016-17 session 4,098 out of 82,948 seats at honours and Master’s level were vacant.

Of the vacant seats, around 79 per cent are from universities in outlying districts. Currently, there are 39 public universities functional and among them nine are in the capital.

The UGC report shows that no seats were vacant at Dhaka University, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University, Bangladesh University of Textiles, Islamic Arabic University, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and Jahangirnagar University at both honours and Master’s level.

No honours level seat was vacant at Jagannath University and Bangladesh University of Professional but there were 800 seats at Master’s level were vacant

at Jagannath and 20 at BUP. Both the universities were established after 2005.

UGC officials said that in 2015-16 session 1,629 seats out of 74,540 were vacant at the same level while in 2014-15 session 16,15 out of 74,322 seats were vacant.

UGC said 125 Master’s seats in 2016-17 session were vacant at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology established in 2003.

Khulna University of Engineering and Technology VC Muhammed Alamgir said that a few seats could remain vacant.

He, however, contested the UGC data saying that number of vacant seat would not be 125.

The UGC chairman said that the annual report was prepared based on information provided by the universities, so they should not deny the figures.

UGC report said that 670 Master’s seats remained vacant at Comilla University established in 2006.

The university registrar, M Majibur Rahman Mazumder, said that in the Master’s programme they tried to enrol students based on merit, therefore a large number of seats remained vacant.

Besides, many students of Master’s discontinue courses as they get jobs or go abroad to study at foreign universities, he says.

‘It is very unfortunate that so many seats remain vacant when many students are going abroad and taking lesson at high cost private universities,’ said Serajul Islam Choudhury.

The number of students heading for universities abroad has doubled in one decade as shown by the latest data of UNESCO.

A total of 33,000 Bangladeshis enrolled for higher education at universities abroad in 2016, over a double from 15,700 in 2007.

‘This is waste of public money,’ Shahjalal University of Science and Technology vice-chancellor Professor Farid Uddin Ahmed said.

UGC 2016 report shows that 51 seats at honours and 681 at Master’s level were vacant at SUST in 2016-17 session.

Often the honours students do not continue and leave the courses midway, therefore the seats fall vacant, Farid Uddin Ahmed points out.

Since it is a technology university, many students start their jobs after the honours and do not feel the need to continue Master’s courses, he adds.

At Rajshahi University, 343 seats at honours level were vacant in 2016-2017 session, shows the UGC report.

RU pro-VC Ananda Kumar Saha said the students often moved to other universities.

Education ministry and UGC officials said that laws for forming a digital university in Gazipur, two medical colleges in Rajshahi and Chittagong and a technical university in Jamalpur were passed by the parliament.

The government is planning to set up another seven universities in Dhaka, Habiganj, Laxmipur, Netrokona, Kishorganj, Chandpur and Bogra.

Spreading higher education was needed but that not should be only for publicity, said Serajul Islam adding many of the new universities did not turn into proper universities.

‘Emphasis should be put on issues of teacher, labs and infrastructure when you are setting up new universities,’ AK Azad Chowdhury suggested.",,http://www.newagebd.net/article/36037/new-outlying-district-public-univs-failing-to-woo-students,2023-05-18 10:36:11,newagebd
918,40pc works still to be done as deadline missed,"Almost 40 per cent of the construction work of haor crops protection embankments in Sunamganj remained incomplete till Saturday, three days after the February 28 deadline, raising farmers’ fears that flash flood may damage their crop like last year.

Water resources ministry allotted Tk 177 crore to construct and repair a total of 550 kilometre embankments along 54 haors in the district, according to Water Development Board sources.

As per a ministry circular, a total of 975 projects were finalised to construct and repair embankments and the same number of project implementation committees comprising local farmers were also formed.

The ministry had instructed formation of the implementation committees by November 30 to start the project works by December 15, 2017 and complete them by February 28 this year.

But, farmers of different parts in the district alleged that apart from various irregularities, construction work of maximum 60 per cent of the haor crop protection dams was completed till Saturday.

Saidur Rahman, a farmer of village Bhorakhali along Naluar Haor at Jagannathpur, told New Age that they had expected that the work of dams would be completed in time since the embankments had been damaged by flash floods last year as the projects did not end in time.

‘Forty per cent work of the embankment near Bhorakhali Sluice Gate along the Naluar Haor has remained incomplete,’ he claimed.

Tahirpur upazila monitoring committee member Alamgir Hossain, also engineer of the upazila office of Local Government and Engineering Department, said that on average only 50 per cent work of the haor embankment projects were completed so far.

Freedom fighter Bazlul Mazid Chowdhury, convener of Haor Banchaw Sunamganj Banchaw Andolan, a local pressure group, said that they were in fear as the embankment construction and repair was not completed by the stipulated time.

‘The standing boro paddy on vast tracts of marshlands in the district may be damaged if case of any early flash flood like last years,’ he said.

Stating that government officials were claiming that 65 per cent works of the projects were completed so far, he asked, ‘When will be the rest work done? Who will take responsibility if the only annual crop of the haor belt’s farmers is damaged again in early flash flood?’

Sunamganj WDB-1 executive engineer Abu Bakkar Siddique Bhuiyan told New Age that the projects could not be completed in the stipulated time because of delayed beginning of the work.

‘The implementation committees could not start working in time because of slow recession of the haor water this year,’ he said, claiming that they were expecting that the remaining work would be completed within the next week.

Sunamganj deputy commissioner Sabirul Islam told New Age that everything was under their close watch.

‘Steps would be taken against the people concerned if the dams were not completed within

the first week of March,’ he warned.

The district Department of Agricultural Extension had set a target of

boro crop cultivation on 2,24,000 hector land this year and the target has been fulfilled.

According to the DAE, standing boro paddy of 1,66,612 hector out of a total 2,23,082 hector wetlands in the district was damaged badly by early flash flood triggered in the end of last March that affected 3.5 lakh families.

Organisations of the farmers and rights activists, however, claimed that more than 90 per cent of the standing boro was damaged by the floods.

919,Rice prices up by 30pc in one year,"A man sells rice the price of which has kept increasing, hitting hard the poor people. The photo was taken at Kaptanbazar in the capital on Friday. — Focusbangla photo

Prices of rice witnessed about 30 per cent hike in past one year and still the prices of the staple showed no sign of decreasing.

According to the government statistics, the prices of rice in last one month increased by up to 3.85 per cent.

According to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, the prices of standard varieties of najirshail and miniket rice increased by 27.08 per cent to Tk 60-62 a kilogram in last one year while the prices of the varieties rose by 1.67 per cent in one month.

Data show that the prices of fine varieties of najirshail and miniket rice increased by 27.36 per cent to Tk 65-70 a kg in last one year.

The prices of the varieties in the last one month increased by 3.85 per cent.

Though the TCB data show the prices of fine varieties of najirshail and miniket at Tk 65-70 a kilogram, in many cases the items are sold at Tk 68-72 a kg in the city.

The TCB data show that the prices of coarse varieties of rice (swarna/China) increased by 18.18 per cent to Tk 44-47 a kg in last one year while the prices increased by 1.11 per cent in last one month.

According to the food ministry, the prices of coarse varieties of rice started to soar in the retail market from March last year and the prices increased to Tk 41.50 from Tk 33.21 a kg in mid-September.

The prices of coarse varieties of rice rose to Tk 50-52 a kg in November and the prices decreased slightly in December due to import of rice and sufficient production of aman.

The prices of rice would remain high for one more month and the prices might decrease in May after starting the harvesting season of boro paddy, said Syed Manirul Islam, proprietor of Barisal Rice Agency at Mohammadpur Krishi Market in the capital.

He said that the rice imported from India was being sold at lower prices than the local varieties but consumers were

showing little interest for the items due to variation in taste.

Amid the price hike of rice, the government has decided to start open market sales of coarse rice from Sunday with a view to intervene the market of the staple.

Under the OMS programme, the government would sell rice at Tk 30 per kilogram and it would continue until the harvest of boro beginning in May.

According to the food ministry, the current stock of rice is over 11.12 lakh tonnes.

Food minister Quamrul Islam on Thursday told New Age that the government was going to start OMS against the backdrop of continued increase in the prices of rice.

The minister hoped that the OMS would create an impact on the rice market.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/35879/rice-prices-up-by-30pc-in-one-year,2023-05-18 10:36:13,newagebd
920,New drug Ice raises concerns,"Representational image.

A relatively new but far more dangerous drug, crystal meth, has turned into a new menace in the country as there has been increased smuggling of the drug from Myanmar in recent months.

The recent major seizures of crystal meth near the Myanmar border have indicated that the market for this relatively expensive drug is booming, raising serious concerns.

Crystal meth, popularly known as Ice, is the common name for crystal methamphetamine, a strong and highly addictive drug that is more harmful than yaba pills, experts said.

Meth is far more expensive than most drugs, including yaba pills, and youths from well-off families in major cities mostly consume meth, said the Department of Narcotics Control director for operations and intelligence, Tanvir Mamtaj.

But more and more substantial volume seizures of the drug near the Myanmar border suggest that there have been growing demands for the drug in Bangladesh, he said.

‘Based on the recent developments, we fear that crystal meth might replace yaba pills in the coming years, which will pose a greater danger. Yaba pills were also pushed into the Bangladeshi drug market gradually and similarly. At the primary stage, yaba pills were also very expensive and gradually got cheaper,’ said Tanvir.

The Rapid Action Battalion and Border Guard Bangladesh seized around 40 kilogrammes of crystal meth in May at Teknaf and Ukhia of Cox’s Bazar and Naikhyangchari of Bandarban after those were smuggled into Bangladesh from Myanmar.

According to the DNC, law enforcement agencies seized 65 grammes of crystal meth only in 2020, 36.798 kilogrammes in 2021, and 113.331 kilogrammes in 2022.

Over 100 kilogrammes of crystal meth were seized in the first four and a half months of 2023.

Crystal meth first came to light when the DNC busted a manufacturing laboratory in the capital’s Jhigatola area in February 2019 and arrested three youths.

A DNC official said that there are three main meth smuggling zones in Bangladesh - the Teknaf border, the Ukhia border, and the remote, steep Naikhyangchari border in Bandarban. The Teknaf and Ukhia borders account for the lion’s share of meth and yaba smuggling.

Most of the crystal meth smuggling into Bangladesh from Myanmar is done through the Naf River. The Ghum Dhum border of Naikhyangchari is another point.

The gang used to collect meth from the Myanmar syndicate through the Ghum Dhum border and store the drugs in Rohingya camps or in steep hills before supplying them to Dhaka and other parts of the country, said a RAB officer.

On May 8, RAB seized over 24 kilogrammes of crystal meth from Cox’s Bazar’s Ukhia in the biggest-ever seizure of the drug in the country.

The seizure took place within 10 days of the previous largest seizure of 22 kilogrammes by the Border Guard Bangladesh in Ukhia.

BGB also seized over 14 kilogrammes of ice and yaba pills on May 11 from Teknaf and Naikhyangchari.

Law enforcement and DNC officials could not speculate on what percentage of smuggled drugs they could seize and what percentage sneaked into the market.

Quoting international studies on drug seizure, professor Arup Ratan Choudhury, president of anti-drug campaign organisation MANAS and member of the National Advisory Committee on Drug Control, said that around 10 per cent of meth might be seized and the rest sneaked into markets.

Arup Ratan said that meth was far more dangerous than yaba pills and might cause greater harm to society.

‘Ice is more stimulating, has a quicker effect on the body, and it may cause organ failure quickly,’ the physician and anti-drug campaigner said.

DNC’s chief chemical examiner, Dulal Krishna Saha, told New Age that the demand for crystal meth had increased in the country because it contained 96 per cent of methamphetamine, while yaba pills contained 10-15 per cent of methamphetamine.

He said crystal meth is new, light, and easy to carry, and in many cases, law enforcers might not recognise it immediately, which encourages smugglers to get more and more engaged in smuggling the drug.

Consumption of a little crystal meth creates both physical and mental reactions, and that is why yaba addicts are getting interested in crystal meth, he said.

Law enforcement officers said that a gram of Ice is sold for between Tk 10,000 and Tk 12,000 in Dhaka, and Ice is more stimulating. Heavy yaba pill addicts now feel that they need something stronger and turn to it.

RAB and police officials said Rohingya camps in Cox’s Bazar have become a major concern for drug smuggling.

Smugglers mostly store drugs in the camps after smuggling them from Myanmar and then supply them to the rest of the country in small consignments.

Syed Harun or Rashid, additional deputy inspector general of APBn-14, the unit dedicated to Rohingya camps, said that most of the clashes inside the camps in recent times took place over drug business control.

‘Whoever controls the camps can control the drug smuggling business, which leads to fatal clashes,’ the police officer said, adding that they often raid the camps and recover drugs there.

RAB-15 commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Saiful Islam said that since crystal meth was expensive, there had been efforts to smuggle it in large consignments.

‘We are alert to meth smuggling with our intelligence and operations activists.’ RAB and BGB’s recent seizures indicate our vigilance,’ said the officer.

‘The recent biggest seizure was made just opposite the Rohingya camp. If the smugglers manage to take the drug into the camps, it will be very difficult to trace it out. So their priority is to sneak it into the camps. But we managed to thwart their effort during the biggest seizure,’ said Saiful.

DNC director Tanvir said that the recent major seizures of meth left them concerned, and as a result, they beefed up intelligence work.

‘The main problem is Myanmar’s non-cooperation. Bangladesh has been sharing intelligence information and details of drug laboratories in Myanmar and seeking their cooperation, but the country is not helping,’ he said.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201939/new-drug-ice-raises-concerns,2023-05-18 10:36:22,newagebd
921,New poor accounts for 51pc of city poor: BIDS,"Shanties on footpaths in the capital keep rising showing that more of the new poor are coming to the city. The photo was taken at Khilgaon in Dhaka on Wednesday. — Sony Ramany

The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed up the poverty level in the capital, with the new poor accounting for 51 per cent of the city poor people, according to a study by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies.

The study was conducted between 2019 and 2022 and the findings were revealed at a programme in a city hotel on Wednesday.

In his address, BIDS director general Binayak Sen said that the emergence of new poor in the capital was the direct consequence of Covid-19, and self-employment played a major role in reducing poverty in the post-corona period.

This happened because initial adverse effects of the pandemic faded away quickly as economic activities returned to normalcy by the beginning of 2022, he pointed out, saying that many had to break their savings to cope with the changing situation.

Urban remittance did not play a direct role in reducing poverty during the period, according to the researcher.

The prolonged Covid-19 had other adverse impacts on the life of the poor as 23.5 per cent extreme poor households stopped education activities for their children, said the study report.

The inaugural session of the programme was attended among others by planning minister MA Mannan and state-minister for planning Dr Shamsul Alam.

Mannan said that poverty could be checked but it could not be eliminated completely.

He noted that poverty was a result of socio-economic factors that could be addressed.

The minister argued that the government implemented social safety net initiatives to improve the living standards of the poor.

Mannan emphasised the need for recognition of the contributions of domestic work to the economy and called for a comprehensive study in this area.

The planning minister stated that understanding the economic value of domestic work would provide a more accurate picture of the country’s economy.

Binayak Sen argued that a special education recovery programme was needed for the urban poor children to minimise their learning loss and reengage them in education.

He urged the policymakers to pay special attention to the new poor for ensuring sustainable development.

The BIDS director general said that their study did not find any significant adverse impacts of corona on increasing divorce rate, adolescent marriage rate for daughters or deterioration of law and order during the difficult months of the pandemic.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201940/new-poor-accounts-for-51pc-of-city-poor-bids,2023-05-18 10:36:23,newagebd
922,Two Bangladesh Army soldiers killed in KNA attack in Bandarban: ISPR,"At least two Bangladesh Army soldiers were killed and two officers injured in an ambush and explosion in Bandarban district on Tuesday.

The incident occurred near Panirchhara in Ruma upazila of the district, Inter-Services Public Relations said, confirming the casualties.

Local administration, however, said that the incident happened in Bilaichari upazila in Rangamati district, which is next to Bandarban’s Ruma upazila.

The ISPR issued a press release on Wednesday stating that the attack was carried out by the Kuki-Chin National Army-KNA, a group based in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

It said that a patrol team, led by Major Mohammad Monowar Hossain, had left Sungsungpara army camp based on an intelligence report regarding the presence of armed ‘miscreants’ in Jarulchharipara.

While en route, the team was ambushed by the Kuki-Chin National Army using improvised explosive devices and gunfire at approximately 1:55 pm, the release said.

The injured personnel were airlifted to the Combined Military Hospital in Chattogram, where Sainik Touhidul Islam, 20, and Sainik Altab Hossain, 24, died.

Their operational commanders, Major Mohammad Monowar Hossain, 30, and Captain Ishtiaq Ahmed, 24, are currently undergoing treatment at the same hospital.

The ISPR highlighted that the Kuki-Chin National Army has been creating an ‘anarchic environment’ in the deep forests of Thanchi, Ruma, and Rawangchari upazilas in the Bandarban district.

KNA did not take responsibility for the incident on its social media page.

Rangamati district police additional superintendent Shah Imran said that the incident was reported in an extremely remote area and that the police were trying to get a ‘clear picture’ of the incident.

‘We can give details of the incident once we receive a complaint on this,’ he told New Age on Wednesday.

Bilaichari upazila nirbahi officer Mizanur Rahman said that they were still gathering information about the incident that took place near Barthali union along the Rangamati and Bandarban border.

Barthali union parishad chairman Atomong Marma said the incident took place some 12 kilometres from the Myanmar border, and they had learned that there was an exchange of fire between the army and KNA.

‘We will get actual information when we can talk to porters accompanying the army team,’ he told New Age.

General SM Shafiuddin Ahmed, the army chief, who is currently on a visit to the United States, expressed his heartfelt condolences to the fallen soldiers and extended his sympathies to their families.

This is the third killing of soldiers in recent months.

On March 12, master warrant officer Nazim Uddin of the army was shot dead and two others were injured after the Kuki-Chin National Army allegedly ambushed an army patrol in a remote area of Rawangchari in Bandarban.

In February 2022, an exchange of fire at a remote village in Ruma upazila in the same district left senior warrant officer Habibur Rahman killed and a soldier named Firoz injured.

The latest ambush that killed two rankers took place within 10 days after three members of the Christian Bawm community, including a ward-level ruling Awami League leader, were found killed near a small village in Rawangchari upazila in Bandarban district on May 8.

One of the victims, Nem Thang Bawm, 35, who runs a local shop, was the president of Ward No 5 Awami League in the union. Local identified two other victims as Sang Lian Bawm, 19, and Lal Lom Lian Bawm, 25.

They are all members of the Bawm Christian community of the Kuki-Chin tribe in Ronin Para, Rawangchari.

Following the incident, the Kuki-Chin National Army-KNA on their Facebook page said that they would never tolerate such ‘inhumane behaviour’ and ‘genocide’ by the ‘joint forces,’ including a faction of the United People’s Democratic Front.

On April 7, the police recovered eight bodies of men in military camouflage in the hilly area of Bandarban’s Rawangchari, several hours after locals heard the sounds of a ‘gunfight.’

The police identified them as KNA activists.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201893/two-bangladesh-army-soldiers-killed-in-kna-attack-in-bandarban-ispr,2023-05-18 10:36:24,newagebd
923,PM urges leaders to make AL stronger from grassroots,"Senior leaders of the Awami League and its associate bodies greet prime minister and party president Sheikh Hasina with a bouquet at her official Ganabhaban residence marking her return to the country in 1981. — PID photo

Prime minister and Awami League president Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday urged the party members to make the party and its associate bodies stronger from the grassroots and work to maintain people’s trust and confidence.

‘Reorganise each of the organisation from the grassroots because the Awami League is the only party that thinks for the welfare of Bangladesh,’ she said.

She said these when senior leaders of the Awami League and its associate bodies greeted her with a flower bouquet at her official Ganabhaban residence, marking her return to the country 42 years back.

The prime minister said that the Awami League was formed by the masses and that every achievement of the country had come through it.

‘Bangladesh Awami League is an organisation of the people and it will work for the masses. It is our only pledge,’ she said.

Terming the remaining other parties as looters, she said, ‘They never work for the people’s welfare. So keep that in mind, everyone should remain vigilant so that the parties of terrorists, killers, or war criminals cannot play ducks and drakes with the fate of the people.’

She said that it was unfortunate that the vote thieves and dacoits were now talking about democracy in the country.

‘We have to hear democratic lessons from them (vote thieves),’ she said.

The AL is the party that has earned people’s confidence in voting rights by introducing transparent ballot boxes and preparing a voter list with photographs.

On the contrary, the BNP-Jamaat alliance had prepared the voter list with 1.23 crore fake votes aimed at manipulating the election.

‘We will always stand beside the masses to change their fates. We will keep continuing our work as we have come to power by winning trust and confidence,’ she said.

The prime minister said that her party successfully maintained the confidence, trust and popularity of the masses despite the fact that it was almost impossible to do so with saying in power for such a long period since 2009 till the date.

Referring to the 2008 general election, she said that the BNP-Jamaat alliance got only 29 seats, while the AL-led grand alliance received the remaining others, proving people’s perception wrong that the Awami League and BNP were the same.

‘We have to keep the confidence and trust of the people in the Awami League. Our only strength is the trust and confidence of the people, and we have no other power,’ she said.

She reminded her party members that military dictator Ziaur Rahman had tried his best to break the Awami League.

The prime minister said that all have to keep in mind that the people of Bangladesh were the only friends of the Awami League.

She greeted all, particularly her party members, for helping her in the endeavour of building the country as well as the party in the last 42 years since she took charge of the Awami League on May 17, 1981, after returning home.

After returning to the country, the prime minister said that she found the people of the country and leaders and activists of the AL beside her instead of getting her near and dear ones, including her parents and brothers.

‘Since then, the people of the country and the Awami League is my family,’ she said.

The prime minister, with due gratitude, had recalled those who had stood beside her during her bad days after her return to the homeland and had now died.

‘After returning home, my only target is to bring the country back on the path of the Liberation War spirit and let people know the country’s true history,’ she said.

She said that her party was almost ready to reach all the civic amenities in the villages.

The AL always stood beside the people in any disaster and thus earned the people’s confidence and trust, she said.

The AL president asked her party members to stand beside the people, making sure the continuation of the country’s development.

‘We will bring smiles to the faces of the distressed people and build Sonar Bangla as dreamt by the Father of the Nation,’ she said.

The prime minister said that Bangladesh got recognition as a developing country due to the continuation of the democratic process in the country.

‘We have to march ahead while keeping intact the status of a developing country,’ she said.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201941/pm-urges-leaders-to-make-al-stronger-from-grassroots,2023-05-18 10:36:25,newagebd
924,BNP asks people to prepare for mass uprising,"The Bangladesh Nationalist Party Dhaka South City unit staged a march from Bashabo to Malibagh with a call for a mass uprising to oust the government. — Sony Ramany

The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party on Wednesday asked the party people to get ready to oust the ruling Awami League government through a popular uprising.

‘No dictatorship just goes away. It has to be removed. So there is no alternative to a popular uprising to remove this government. Prepare for this,’ BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain asked the party leaders and activists.

Addressing a rally in Dhaka, Mosharraf said that there had been no incident like the withdrawal of escorts of foreign diplomats in the country in 51 years of independence.

‘The government did not get any benefit by visiting foreigners. So the government has gone mad. Be careful. Don’t fall into any conspiracy or trap. The government will be forced to hold elections under a non-partisan, neutral government,’ he said at the rally.

The rally was held before the start of a road-march programme organised by the Dhaka metropolitan north unit of the BNP to protest against the continued arrest of BNP leaders and activists across the country.

Mosharraf said that there was corruption from the highest level to the lowest level in Bangladesh.

The country’s money has been smuggled and emptied, and the people of the country cannot eat their two full meals in a day, he said.

‘The middle class is getting poorer. The government has increased the prices of daily necessities at its will,’ he said, adding that the people of the country do not go to vote during this government.

‘A by-election held a few days ago saw just 14 per cent voter turnout. This means that no one wants to vote under this government. Sheikh Hasina [prime minister] will not allow any more votes to remain in power,’ he said.

At the end of the rally, the activists started the road march in front of the North Badda Shahjadpur Subastu Tower, passed through Rampura, and ended at the Malibagh Abul Hotel crossing.

Several hundred BNP leaders and activists joined the road march with colourful caps and placards.

BNP vice-chairman Abdul Awal Mintoo, social welfare affairs secretary Kamruzzaman Ratan, student affairs secretary Rafiqul Islam Bakul, health affairs secretary Rafiqul Islam, and national executive committee member Tabith Awal spoke at the programme, among others.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201942/bnp-asks-people-to-prepare-for-mass-uprising,2023-05-18 10:36:26,newagebd
925,Equal education leads to a better society,"— Change

EDUCATION is known to be strongest when voices and diverse perspectives are heard and shared around the community. It is vital that young people are given the space and safety to express them without feeling ashamed. The idea of special education is governed by the concept that education is for all. It is true that not everyone learns the same way; hence, teachers in institutions should examine how a child learns and what struggles they face regularly.

A system called ‘Special Educational Needs’ was developed to help individuals who needed it learn more effectively. Special needs that are not met are a problem in Bangladesh and other countries. More support is needed to guarantee that kids with SEN have the same learning opportunities as students without SEN. Due to hidden or neurodivergent difficulties, children in special education may need instructional adaptations.

SEN children are entitled to thrive just like other children. They should get the opportunity to express themselves. People should be able to accept that it is okay for a child to be different, and it is not out of the ordinary for a child to have a learning difficulty. What is wrong is that people discriminate against normal kids and make them feel less. They need to consider what help a child may need when it comes to education.

By focusing on attentive learning and incorporating hands-on activities and visual aids into their lessons, teachers can assist students with unique educational needs. To monitor the student’s development, a specific mentor should be appointed. The students should undergo routine health examinations in schools, and there are programmes in the US and UK for the less fortunate. Schools have connections to professionals who can aid in the education of children with SEND, and teachers are skilled at assisting pupils who are having difficulty learning.

The most crucial information to take is that children with special needs frequently encounter discrimination, bullying, and social injustice. Parents should try to offer them emotional support as well as educate others about SEN and promote awareness of it. All schools and teachers should receive special education needs training, and colleges should include this topic in their curriculum. Using a variety of learning techniques, including read-and-write, kinaesthetic, auditory, and visual, teachers and parents can support their children’s academic performance. SEN students often struggle with a variety of issues, including behavioural issues, physical challenges, emotional challenges, etc.

Those who are categorised as having learning difficulties also deserve access to education. Students in mainstream school yet experience difficulties when it comes to having support at school. Obstacle to supply quality literacy must be overcome in future. It is a challenge for SEN students to learn the same content without extra support. They will need more time and teachers and parents should be patient enough to encourage and motivate the child towards learning.

926,Will a pilot project ensure Rohingya repatriation?,"— Agence France-Presse

EVEN though the repatriation of Rohingyas has made no substantial progress in the last five years, a delegation of Rohingya refugees travelled to Myanmar on May 5 to see new facilities erected in preparation for the resurrection of the long-stalled plan. Officials have expressed optimism that repatriations will resume later this month.

Over one million Rohingya are currently residing in the world’s largest refugee camps in Bangladesh, and the vast majority of them fled a 2017 military offensive in Myanmar that is currently under investigation by the United Nations for genocide. Repatriation of Rohingya refugees is currently the main concern for Bangladesh, and there have been difficulties with overpopulation, instability, and violence in the refugee camps.

When it comes to helping the Rohingya, Bangladesh has already gone above and beyond. Bangladesh is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention. As a result, Bangladesh is not required by law to house any refugees on its territory. However, for humanitarian reasons, Bangladesh has provided Rohingyas with shelter.

Previous futile attempts

IN JANUARY 2018, Bangladesh and Myanmar signed the Physical Arrangement Agreement. In accordance with its terms, Myanmar was supposed to make all necessary preparations for their return, and from the date the repatriation begins, they would finish it within two years. Since then, unfortunately, little progress has been made, and the United Nations has repeatedly warned that conditions are not suitable for their repatriation.

Following the widespread exodus of the Rohingyas from Myanmar’s Rakhine state to Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar in 2017, two unsuccessful repatriation attempts were made in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In both instances, the Rohingyas refused to return to their homeland out of fear of further persecution and a hostile resettlement environment. With the military takeover of Myanmar in 2021, the junta, liable for mass murders and genocide against the Rohingyas, was consolidating its power, uninterested in resolving the crisis despite Bangladesh and other allies’ efforts and initiatives.

Why is repatriation stalling?

THE primary causes of the impasse in the repatriation process are Myanmar’s reluctance, the Covid pandemic, and the military coup in Myanmar. In June of last year, the Rohingyas staged a massive demonstration and expressed their desire to return home. The primary obstacle lies in figuring out how they are going to return.

Growing threats

IN ORDER to establish 34 settlements in the Ukhia and Teknaf regions, Bangladesh had to endure enormous ecological damage. There are now over 12 million Rohingya residing there. Every year, there are 35 thousand births. Once-forested land covering 4,500 acres has been completely destroyed. In addition, funding for Rohingya refugees in 2022 has decreased substantially compared to the two previous years, which has alarmed humanitarian organisations and the Bangladeshi government.

The situation in the Rohingya refugee settlements is deteriorating because Western countries have shifted their focus to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Multiple global crises have exacerbated the condition. In 2022, only 43 per cent of the required amount of $881 million under the Joint Response Plan was funded, according to reports. In 2021, 72 per cent of the required $943 million was disbursed.

Sudden appearance of ‘pilot project’

ON MAY 5, a delegation of approximately 20 Rohingyas and seven Bangladeshi officials, including a border patrol officer, were sent to visit the two model villages constructed for the pilot return project. According to Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, the new facilities for returning refugees include a market, hospital and reception centre.

Officials anticipate that the repatriations will commence later this month, prior to the annual monsoon season. Previously, a list of more than 880,000 Rohingyas was sent to Myanmar, where the identities of approximately 70,000 were verified by them. As previously stated, approximately 1,100 individuals were verified in the initial phase as a pilot initiative for their return. Later, Myanmar objected to the inclusion of 429 individuals on the list.

Compulsive reactions of NGOs

WHILE Bangladesh is trying heart and soul to repatriate the Rohingyas to their birthplace, the NGOs are not doing enough for the most persecuted community of our time. While Bangladesh and Myanmar are preparing their returnee lists and facilitating the repatriation, INGOs and NGOs are expressing concerns over the plan. The UNHCR and other NGOs are only maintaining the camps. Due to other emerging crises and donor fatigue, these NGOs are also reducing their efforts in every aspect after six years. Recently, the World Food Programme reduced its monthly per capita ration from only $12 to $10, citing a fund shortage.

Advocacy networks such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International failed to create effective pressure on Myanmar. Like the NGOs, the great powers also failed to pressurise Myanmar effectively. As a result, Bangladesh is carrying the burden alone. China’s involvement and the junta’s willingness can therefore be seen as burden-sharing for Bangladesh. And Bangladesh, which has not seen any results in the last six years, cannot help but explore the option. The declining fund, deteriorating camp conditions, growing insecurity, and adverse impact of the refugees on the host community have made Bangladesh a desperate host looking to reduce the burden, where its international partners are only performing their formal duties within a set boundary.

Moreover, the ‘conducive environment’ debate is also a politically biased one. As the junta is repatriating, it is guaranteeing their safety. The other stakeholders in Rakhine and Myanmar, the Arakan Army and the National Unity Government, have already recognised the Rohingya. Furthermore, as China is backing the deal, it also has the responsibility to provide an external guarantee for the Rohingya’s safety upon repatriation. Therefore, it may not be unsafe to explore the possibilities of repatriation with the Junta. It seems the NGOs are driven by their own compulsion to lengthen ‘projects’ and squeeze their donors, displaying the plight of the refugee community. Thus, INGO and NGO politics must be avoided in this regard.

Impact of pilot project?

HOW beneficial would the pilot repatriation be for Bangladesh and the Rohingya people? The answer could be positive. The programme may be viewed as the beginning of a long-overdue repatriation, which may inspire greater repatriation in the future. Bangladesh has a severe dilemma regarding how to handle this refugee crisis for years to come, including questions of national security, funding, administration, and the treatment of refugees and host populations. Due to the Ukraine conflict, the Rohingya humanitarian crisis has already lost its urgency for the international community.

The pilot repatriation project offered by Myanmar may pave the way for the early repatriation of 1.1 million Rohingyas.

We can consider the pilot project the beginning of the long-overdue repatriation, which might inspire the Rohingyas to return to Myanmar from Bangladesh in the future. Rohingyas should go back to their homeland, Myanmar, now, as the whole population cannot spend years in another country in refuge. Rohingyas have the right to go back to their own nation, their own territory, and their own homes, where they can exercise all of their civil rights and strive towards constructing a better life and future for themselves and their offspring.

Bangladesh’s government and the majority of its citizens share the Rohingya’s humanitarian concerns. We cannot, however, provide refuge for this enormous population for very long. Although our nation is small, it has a sizable population. In the Rohingya camps, extortion, murder, rape, and the sale of arms have all been documented. Internal anarchy is growing. The decision to provide asylum to the Rohingya was an act of humanitarianism.

The international community now has a duty to help repatriate them. The international community actively participate in ensuring an early repatriation of the Rohingyas. Myanmar must ensure that the return of Rohingya Muslims is continuous, dignified, and sustainable.

927,Too famished to sing paeans,"Congress supporters celebrate the party’s victory in the Karnataka state legislative assembly election in front of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee office in Bengaluru, India, on May 13. — Agence France-Presse/Manjunath Kiran

A QUAINT Hindi metaphor nicely describes the results from the Karnataka state polls that saw prime minister Modi’s religious bigotry roundly thwarted. ‘Bhookhe bhajan na hoey, Gopala.’ In other words: ‘Lord, much as we love you, it’s not possible to sing your praise on an empty stomach.’ Indeed, while the BJP continued its communal rant against Muslims, their dress code, their food culture, and promoted religious polarisation to dip into a cynically assembled Hindu vote bank, the Congress stole a march on its opponent by committing to poverty alleviation, promising free rice to the poor, useful units of electricity, unemployment stipend for graduates and diploma holders, and free bus travel for women across the state.

Every detail that Rahul Gandhi had culled from his long march was put into the election manifesto. The party wouldn’t allow communal rhetoric by the BJP to shift focus from the yawning rich-poor disparity, a major issue with India’s IT hub. It squarely targeted crony capitalism for the mess, underscored by backing public ire against pervasive corruption. Simultaneously, the Congress promised to deal firmly with communal violence.

The promise rekindled the party’s lost habit to confront the Hindutva challenge boldly on two fronts, economic and social, by rallying against crony capitalism and poverty and a commitment to repair the social fabric damaged by BJP’s communal politics. Rewards came swiftly. Commitment to fight communalism saw traditional Muslim votes shift from their traditional support for former prime minister Deve Gowda’s Janata Dal (Secular) party. Its recent flirting with the BJP cost it dear, and shored up the Congress percentage of vote share to over 43 per cent, roughly a 5 per cent rise from 2018. However, the BJP vote stayed more or less uniform at 36 per cent. In other words, the Hindu right has kept its flock together, losing less than 0.5 per cent to the Congress.

While the BJP studiously shunned them, the Congress fielded 15 Muslim candidates of whom nine won. Symbolically and as material support to a hounded community, the Congress promised to restore a 4 per cent quota of reservation for jobs and admission in educational institutions for Muslims. The BJP had taken away the quota marked for the community and split the 4 per cent equally between two Hindu castes. Above all, the Congress promised to rein in vigilante assaults unleashed by groups like the Bajrang Dal and lumpen street brawlers sponsored by Hindutva minders. The Bajrang Dal is so called after Lord Rama’s heroic aide, Hanuman. An interesting aside in the elections was Modi’s last minute bid at the fag end of the campaign to liken the Congress promise to shut down Bajrang Dal’s violence as an insult to Hanuman, and on cue it became the main narrative on TV channels loyal to the prime minister. The adverse results could be seen as a rebuke to Modi’s equating the lumpen group with a revered deity.

Commonly known as ‘WhatsApp University’ its Muslim-baiting saw the BJP inventing two Hindu characters from a particular caste, claiming they were the ones who killed the Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan, the legendary challenger to British rule. Tipu eventually fell in May 1799 to a joint force of the Marathas, British troops and the army of the Nizam of Hyderabad. The BJP has been on a spree of overturning historical facts or making them vanish from schoolbooks.

To restore the impugned books and revive intellectual vigour, or generally to fortify the democratic institutions against future subversion, the opposition needs to defeat Modi in 2024. Analysts see the Karnataka results in which the Congress has won an impressive 135 seats against the BJP’s 66 in a 224-seat House, as a prelude to that end. Before the general elections, however, there would be more contests later this year, in which the Congress faces the BJP. Elections in Congress-ruled Rajasthan and BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh in particular would be crucial pointers to the headwinds ahead.

Winning back power from the BJP in a southern state is possibly easier than fighting a communal challenge in a northern state. There is a clear north-south divide in communal politics. When Indira Gandhi was routed in the post-emergency elections in the north, the southern states stood resolutely with the Congress in 1977. Gandhi began her revival from Karnataka, winning the Lok Sabha seat vacated for her in Chikmaglur. A slogan mocked the Janata Party, which collapsed with internal feuding soon after routing the Congress. ‘Ek sherni sao langur. Chikmagalur bhai Chikmagalur.’ (One tigress is enough to take on 100 monkeys. Thank you Chikmagalur.) Could Karnataka again revive the Congress party’s fortunes?

The question can be framed differently. Would the magic of Rahul Gandhi’s long march shored up by powerful local leaders in Karnataka replicate in, say, Madhya Pradesh in a straight fight with the BJP? Also, the Congress is a house divided in Rajasthan, where the chief minister confessed to taking help from a former BJP counterpart to thwart an internal coup. Five years ago, the Congress managed to significantly win a 39.3 per cent vote share, 6 per cent more than what it got in 2013 when it won a paltry 21 seats. In comparison, the BJP’s votes went down from 45.2 per cent to 38.8 per cent, a difference of 6.4 per cent. Today, both are nearly at par. Much would depend on how the Congress positions itself with other opposition parties. Would they be able to arrive at a modus vivendi about their larger future soon, preferably with a common minimum programme to avoid ideological logjam? Karnataka is a good beginning, not least for the way the Congress has tackled attempts by the BJP to introduce communal discourse. It stuck to secular issues. The question is: will the northern voters be ready to sing paeans to anyone, on an empty stomach?

928,Respecting invisible geopolitical faultlines,"— Counter Punch/Luca Bravo

IF WE look back on the major wars of the prior century and forward to the growing menace of a war fought with nuclear weaponry, there is one prominent gap in analysis and understanding. This gap is to my knowledge rarely acknowledged, or even discussed, by political leaders or addressed in the supposedly independent main media platforms in the west. Indeed, the gap seems to be explicitly denied, and given a hegemonic twist, by the Biden presidency, especially by Antony Blinken’s repeated insistence that American foreign policy, unlike that of its principal adversaries, is ‘rule-governed.’

At first glance ‘rule-governed’ might be nothing more than a concise synonym for adherence to international law. Blinken makes no such claim, and even a foreign policy hawk would have a hard time straining to rationalise American international behavior as ‘law-governed,’ but rather might say, or at least believe, following Thucydides, ‘that strong do as they will, while the weak do as they must.’ Some have speculated that ‘rule-governed’ as a phrase of choice these days in Washington is best associated with a rebirthing of ‘Pax Americana,’ or as I have previously suggested a dusting off of the Monroe Doctrine that had guided U.S. foreign policy toward Latin America to proclaim after the Soviet implosion in 1991 what is in effect a Monroe Doctrine for the world, or seen from a different perspective, the NATO-ization of the post-Cold War world.’

Such provocative labels seems descriptive of the NATO response to the Russian 2022 attack on Ukraine, which from day one was treated by the West as a flagrant instance of a Crime Against the Peace, more generally viewed as a war of aggression, and so declared by a large majority of countries by way of a UN General Assembly resolution ES-11/1, of March 2022, by a vote of 122-5, with 35 abstentions including China and India) although without comparable support for the follow up to denouncing the attack by way of imposing sanctions, supplying weapons, and diplomatic strong-arming looking toward a military victory rather than a political compromise achieved through a ceasefire followed by negotiations.

What seems to many, mostly in the West, obvious at first glance at the Ukraine war is not so clear if a closer look is taken. There is the matter of the pre-war context of Ukrainian and NATO provocations as well as the Russian right of veto entrenched in the UN charter, amounting to a green light given to the winners in World War II to the use of international force at their discretion when it comes to peace and security issues, and in the process ignore Charter obligations to seek a peaceful settlement of all international disputes.

The US/UK unprovoked attack on Iraq in 2003 is indicative of this double standard manifested by the response to the Russian attack, as were the NATO regime-changing intervention in Libya and Euro-American support for the Saudi intervention in Yemen and a host of other examples going back to the Vietnam War. In other words, ‘rule-governed’ as a practical matter seems to mean impunity whenever the US, its allies and friends, launch ‘wars of choice’ and accountability in relation to international law for its adversaries, particularly its geopolitical rivals, who are denied the intended benefits of their right of veto and held responsible for adherence to international law in the war/peace domain as it is presented in the UN charter. In effect, international law is not a restraint on the US/NATO with respect to war-making, but it functions as a strategic policy and propaganda tool for use against adversaries. Such duplicity in deploying the authority of law is widely seen outside of the West as a glaring example of moral hypocrisy that undermines more generally the aspiration of substituting the rule of law for force in relations between the Great Powers in the nuclear age.

These is more to this exhibition of double standards and moral hypocrisy as illustrated by another related Blinken elaboration of the kind of world order he affirms on behalf of the US. It is his ahistorical assertion that ‘spheres of influence’ should have been thrown into the dustbin of history after World War II, and therefore the fact that Ukraine (and Crimea) border on Russia, with long intertwined historical experience, ethnic ties, and territorial instabilities be treated as irrelevant. Surely, Cubans or Venezuelans, or earlier Chileans and certainly Central Americans, would be excused if they laughed out loud, given the forcible contemporaneous efforts of Washington to deny the populations of these countries respect for their sovereign rights, including even the inalienable right of self-determination. Spheres of influence are admittedly abusive with respect to bordering societies, whether maintained by Russia or the United States, and yet in an imperfectly governed world such spheres in certain regional settings play crucial war prevention roles. They can mitigate potential geopolitical confrontations in which deference by antagonists to previously well-delimited spheres of influence can be credited with providing a brake on escalation at times of crisis. East/West spheres of influence for preserving world peace during the most dangerous crises of the cold war, most notably at the time of the Berlin Crises (1950s), Soviet interventions in Eastern Europe (1956–1968), Cuban missile crisis (1961).

Rather than dispensing with spheres of influence the wartime leaders of the US, the UK, and the USSR in World War II recognised even during their common cause against Naziism that an anticipated post-war rivalry between the winners to pursue their distinct national interests by extending their ideological, political, and economic influence, especially in Europe could turn dangerous. These leaders, although espousing hostile ideologies, sought agreements to avoid postwar confrontations in Europe at a series of conferences. The leaders of the US, the USSR, and the UK reached agreements, most notably in 1945 at Yalta and Potsdam, that might have done more to prevent a slide into World War III than certainly the UN Charter and maybe even the much invoked doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction (or MAD as denoting the pathology of genocidal peacemaking in the nuclear age).

These wartime agreements did not explicitly use the cynical language of spheres of influence but rather stressed the divisions relating to the occupation of European countries previously controlled by the defeated fascist states, with a particular attention given to Germany that was seen as the most culpable and dangerous actor among the Axis Powers. In this regard, alone among European states, Germany was divided into East Germany and West Germany, and its capital city of Berlin was notoriously divided into West Berlin and East Berlin. For the rest of Europe, the Soviet Union was given responsibility for occupation and state building in East Europe while the victors assumed a comparable responsibility in Western Europe.

This language of division did not inhibit both ‘superpowers’ from engaged in propaganda wars with one another throughout the Cold War. Yet what it did do was to induce international prudence in a form that was respectful of these wartime assessments of control. This prudence was in stark contrast to the inflammatory response of the West to the 2023 Russian attack on Ukraine, accentuated by disdaining diplomacy, a political compromise, and openly seeking the Russian defeat so as to confirm post-Cold War unipolarity when it comes to peace and security issues. Undoubtedly, the wartime atmosphere in 1944-45 contributed to the importance of taking preventive measures to guard against the recurrence of a major war fought over the control and future of Europe. The Potsdam Conference took ended less than a week before an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Harry Truman informing Stalin that the US possessed a super-weapon that would hasten the unconditional surrender of Japan, as indeed it did.

Although conducted prior to the use of the atomic bomb this wartime diplomacy was fearfully aware that a future war would be far more destructive than two earlier world wars. In this sense, these fault lines in Europe were established in an atmosphere of hope and fear, but also within limits set by state-centrism and geopolitical ambition, giving rise quickly to tensions that extinguished hopes of retaining postwar international harmony, thereby dimming hopes of transcending the high-risk Great Power rivalries of the past. This led to Cold War bipolarity with its complex ideological, military, territorial, and political dimensions of intense conflict. And yet World War III was avoided, despite some close calls, in the ensuing 45 years after the end of World War II.

The idea of ‘geopolitical fault lines’ and even ‘spheres of influence’ are not well established in the practice or theory of international relations, but their existence is profoundly necessary for the maintenance of peace and security among Great Powers, and for the world generally. This relevance of geopolitical fault lines is partly a result of the failure of international law to have the capability to enforce consistently limits on the coercive behavior of the reigning Great Powers, granting them de facto impunity for acting beyond the limits of the law. In this sense, geopolitical fault lines and related agreed territorial divisions offer an improvised substitute for international law by setting formally agreed mutual limits on behavior backed by the specific commitments of Great Powers, which it is known that when transgressed result severe tensions, and possibly catastrophic warfare, between the most heavily armed states in the world might result.

The overriding point is that the Biden/Blinken response to the Ukraine War and the rise of China are contemptuous of the geopolitical prudence and diplomatic techniques that helped save the world from a disastrous conflagration during the Cold War Era. Of course, costly warfare broke out in the divided countries of Korea and Vietnam, but in settings where there was no assent to the temporary division imposed from without and the strategic stakes of challenging these imposed supposedly temporary divisions were peripheral as contrasted with Germany where they were of the highest order. Despite this, in the Korean and Vietnam contexts, the stakes were still high enough for the US to threaten the use of nuclear weapons to maintain the status quo, most menacingly in relation to Korea, and China acting on the basis of border security entered the conflict.

It goes almost out saying that geopolitical fault lines and spheres of influence are second-order restraints whose indispensability reflects the weakness of international law and the UN. Remedying these weaknesses should be accorded the highest priority by governments and peace-minded civil society activists. In the interim, spheres of influence are a recognition of multipolarity, a prelude to a more cooperative world order, and a sign that the distinctive challenges to the global public good posed by climate change and nuclear weaponry do indeed require a ‘new world order’ reflecting imperatives for leading states to act cooperatively rather than conflictually. Perhaps, the Ukraine War can yet be interpreted to produce such a transition in outlook and behavior.

929,What Congress win in Karnataka means,"Congress supporters celebrate the party’s victory in the Karnataka state legislative assembly election in front of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee office in Bengaluru, India, on May 13. — Agence France-Presse/Manjunath Kiran

JUST as the Congress was being written off as a party that was slowly fading away from the political space, it won in Karnataka. This is a big surprise because the ‘grand, old party’, as the Congress is often called, received a serious blow after Rahul Gandhi had lost his parliamentary qualification to hold his seat as a result of his alleged slur on Modi’s surname. He has appealed to the Gujarat High Court but the assigned judge recused himself, expressing his inability to listen to the appeal. More drama is expected.

Meanwhile, the Karnataka election came into the centre stage which the under pressure Congress won, defeating the in-power Bharatiya Janata Party. Given the kinds of relative political strength on display, the victory certainly has echoed in many chambers. Indian politics has major ramifications in not just the region but beyond that as well.

Why Congress won

NOT many were expecting this result; so, few analyses are available that predicted such a victory. However, since the win, Indian media has been scrambling to explain what happened. Media commentators in general agree that the biggest factor is that local issues dominate rather than the usual national issues that come with the Modi wave. It was, thus, more of a local campaign.

The Congress party, for example, focused on the corruption of the BJP incumbency. BJP leaders have become both greedy and complacent since being in power. Even the Karnataka State Contractors’ Association said that they had to shell out up to 40 per cent as commission to finish projects and get paid. ‘The 40% government’ became a slogan and it hurt the BJP. The Congress’s strategy of not mentioning national issues or Modi which has helped in the past also helped it to make it a largely local election.

Managing vote clusters

THE Congress also ran targeted campaigns, focusing individually on various castes and Muslims votes. Its support among the scheduled castes was 60 per cent this year— higher than before — and 88 per cent Muslims backed the Congress, say exit polls. The Lingayat community, which has traditionally backed the BJP, did not make a critical difference. So, this approach, instead of a single blanket for all approaches, worked.

This policy to revive the cause of the backward or less privileged communities went well. Former CM Siddaramaiah’s revival of AHINDA, or the platform for backward classes and castes, gave it a mass face which benefited the Congress party at the polls.

Managing infighting

THE two local top leaders — Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar — are both rivals, but the central party leadership was able to contain it. This led to joint campaigns, which were a great boost for the party in the internal cohesion, image management and the public mobilisation sector.

BJP looked a bit complacent

THE Bharatiya Janata Party had three major obstacles. Its local leadership was not strong enough to counter the strategy of the recently victorious local leadership of the Congress party. It also lost the support of the Lingayat community on which it over depended. And lastly, its main ally Janata Dal (S) also did badly.

It may also have become complacent because of the Congress party’s apparent lack of clout. The Lingayat reservation demands were listened to only too late and the removal of the Muslim reservation to appease them looked more hurriedly done electoral than political policy based. And the corruption issue did hurt them badly.

Future signs?

MANY are finding signs that the BJP wave has finally washed away, but there is no proof that it has. The Congress has four states including this and Aam Admi Party has two and has become the major opposition parties. However, it shows, just as the BJP has developed incumbency-related weaknesses, the parties opposing it realise that a joint front both within and across parties is what makes a difference.

The BJP wave is real and its strength in the relatively impoverished north India, particularly Uttar Prades and Bihar, is quite unchallenged. There too, some local BJP leaders like Yogi Yadittyanath who are great managers of politics and these factors matter.

Right now the Bharatiya Janata Party has the confidence of the majority of poor and middle-class Hindus as well as the economically aspirant class. Minority issues do not matter and India may well be masking the fact that there is no national issue anywhere other than the rule of the majority. Karnataka showed that. Where there is a division, winning means playing the cluster game which the Congress did well.

Electoral wins are matters of numbers and those who win are the ones who get more votes, not why. The BJP has done that very well till date. Toppling it means learning from the BJP how it did it. Elections are not about idealism; it is about the cynical management of public sentiments and that applies anywhere.

930,Freshwater scarcity already a big problem,"— Undark Magazine

The availability of safe drinking water, particularly in Bangladesh’s hard-to-reach areas, is feared to worsen as the country experiences the effects of climate change. According to a study by the World Bank’s water and sanitation programme, about 28 million Bangladeshis are living in harsh conditions in the hard-to-reach areas that make up a quarter of the country’s landmass. The study found that char land that emerges from riverbeds as a result of the deposit of sediments is among the most inaccessible, along with hilly areas, coastal regions, and haors and wetland areas in north-east Bangladesh. People living in hard-to-reach areas are often vulnerable to natural calamities like flooding, riverbank erosion and siltation.

As a result of climate change, salinity in Bangladesh’s coastal areas has increased, causing a lack of sweet water. Women in coastal and haor areas need to travel miles to collect a pitcher of safe drinking water. Bangladesh has made significant progress in universal access to improved water sources, with more than 97 per cent of the population having had access in 2013. But access to safe drinking water is still low at 34.6 per cent. Between 2000 and 2012, the proportion of the population drinking arsenic-affected water dropped from 26.6 per cent to 12.4 per cent. Yet Bangladesh is still the country with the largest proportion of people exposed to arsenic contamination in the world. More than 1.8 million people in Bangladesh lack access to an improved water source, and 36 million lack improved sanitation.

Now more than ever, access to safe water is critical to the health of families in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a global leader when it comes to microfinance and is known as the birthplace of this innovative financial model. Since the 1970s, vibrant and sustained growth in the microfinance sector has had an enormous impact on the financial inclusion of those living in poverty, particularly women.

Bangladesh’s high need for water and sanitation improvements, along with its healthy microfinance sector and government support, makes it an ideal market for Water.org’s financial solutions to the water crisis. We need to expand our impact with our current partners and create new partnerships with additional microfinance institutions and commercial banks. Commercial banks are critical to the expansion strategy as they can offer low-interest loan products to a broad audience of people in need.

Bangladesh will also partner with financial institutions to explore offering loans for water and sanitation through digital financial services so that customers can access and repay loans using their mobile phones. Water.org has strong partnerships with sector stakeholders in Bangladesh, such as the World Bank and the Palli-Karma Sahayak Foundation. Such partnerships are critical to driving policies that free capital for water and sanitation lending and encourage the uptake of financial solutions to help end the water crisis. Bangladesh is looking forward to recharging its aquifers with storm water, reclaimed water, desalinated water and potable water in an effort to ward off the depletion of this precious resource.

Bangladesh ranks sixth in the world for countries with the largest estimated annual groundwater extraction, according to the UN World Water Development Report 2022. By 2030, groundwater levels in the greater Dhaka area may drop by between 3 and 5.1 metres per year, approximately 70 per cent faster than the current rate, according to a study by the Bangladesh Water Partnership and supported by the 2030 Water Resource Group. There are vast stores of fresh water held in a permeable rock layer underground that are usually recharged by surface water seeping into the ground. In cases where the rate at which water is extracted from the aquifer exceeds the rate of recharge, managed aquifer recharge can inject water from other sources that typically would not reach the permeable rock.

This includes storm water, reclaimed water, desalinated water and drinking water, allowing a subsequent recovery or environmental benefits for Bangladesh. The country’s economy relies heavily on agriculture, as 63.2 per cent of the country’s population works in industries and agriculture. Even with an unemployment rate of less than 4 per cent, the poverty rate is 21.8 per cent. The dense population, small area, reliance on agriculture and poverty rate cumulatively create a crucial need for clean water.

Humanitarian organisations aim to improve the water quality in Bangladesh. Water quality in Bangladesh has been a long-term struggle. Since the country’s independence in 1971, international aid agencies have helped Bangladesh with its water crisis. At the time, a quarter of a million Bangladeshi children were dying each year from bacteria-contaminated surface water. Because of contaminated surface waters in the region, 90 per cent of the population relies on groundwater. Groundwater is the water that lies below the earth’s surface between soil pore spaces and fractures of rock formations. This water source is accessible through tube wells in the region.

International aid agencies such as UNICEF and the World Bank helped Bangladesh improve access to water. To combat the poor-quality surface drinking water and provide more water for agriculture, these organisations funded the installation of about four million tube wells between 1960 and 1970. The tube wells created access to groundwater throughout the entire country. Unfortunately, this led to mass poisoning because of contaminated groundwater. The largest mass poisoning in history occurred in Bangladesh. In the 1990s, arsenic was detected in the well water. The wells dug in the 1960s and 1970s were not tested for metal impurities, impacting an estimated 30–35 million people in Bangladesh. Ailments from exposure to arsenic include gastrointestinal diseases, physical deformities, cancer, nerve and circulatory system damage and death. About 1.12 million of the four million wells in Bangladesh are still contaminated with arsenic. Poor water quality significantly impacts public health. Arsenic poisoning is now the cause of death for one out of five people in Bangladesh.

However, officials used poor testing kits to examine the wells, leading to incorrectly marked wells. Unfortunately, many green-marked wells hold contaminated water that the public still uses. Additionally, the wells that were marked red were never properly closed off and can still be used today. When both the wealthy and the impoverished in Bangladesh struggle greatly with poor water quality, the population living below the poverty line struggles in accessing safe water and from water-related diseases and illnesses three times more. Roughly two million people in poverty still lack access to improved water sources.

Worsening weather extremes that bring floods, storm surges and cyclones are contributing to increases in water salinity and other problems such as accessing clean water in hard-to-reach areas. River bank erosion has turned many people in these areas into refugees. Since they are very close to the Bay of Bengal, the amount of arsenic in the groundwater is also very high. We need to dig much deeper to get arsenic-free water. The struggle to find drinkable water intensifies during the summer. In the drought-prone Barind Tract area in north Bangladesh, people need to dig more than 350 metres to get safe drinking water.

Even in Dhaka, people have reported dwindling water supplies. Dhaka’s underground aquifers are usually recharged with water that percolates underground in nearby districts, but the levels of underground fresh water in those districts have also dropped, allowing seawater to start seeping into the aquifers. If this continues, Dhaka’s drinking water could become increasingly undrinkable. The quality of water in many parts of Bangladesh has, as studies show, already deteriorated, leaving a significant part of the population without access to safe water.

931,Preparing or posturing for Lanka elections?,"— News Cutter

THE discussions that Sri Lanka’s president Ranil Wickremesinghe has commenced with the Tamil parties in the north and the east are seen as a possible precursor to elections in those two provinces. The talks are scheduled over three days. The president has an interest in holding some form of elections as the government’s moral legitimacy has been undermined by its refusal to conduct the local government elections on schedule. The president would be conscious that the manner of his election, by parliament and not by the people, creates an issue of moral legitimacy that needs to be addressed. The grounds for the repeated postponement of local government elections, that the money is either unavailable or better spent elsewhere, is clearly unacceptable from a democratic or rule of law perspective. The opposition leader Sajith Premadasa’s offer to pass a constitutional amendment to have early presidential elections reflects this sentiment.

There is speculation that provincial elections will take place before presidential elections which are expected to take place by the end of the year and this is the reason for the president to engage in discussions with the Tamil parties. One of the matters taken up for discussion has been the construction of several Buddhist temples in areas in which there are few if any Buddhists currently living which is causing much heartburn to Tamils and Muslims living there. Ancient Buddhist ruins are re-discovered in different parts of the north and east by the archaeology department. At the same time there has been destruction of existing Hindu shrines, both ancient and more recent, by unidentified groups which has led to a suspicion that there is a government hand on account of the large presence of security forces in those areas.

Wickremesinghe has moved swiftly to address the problems by discussing these matters with officials from the archaeology department. On inquiry, they have admitted that their archaeological work in the north and the east is funded by Buddhist monks and not by the government as the government has no money at the present time. The director general of the archaeology department told the president that priority has been given to the north and the east, because it was neglected for 30 years and mostly they do not get government money, but from different funding agencies. The official said sometimes the archaeology department is given funds by monks. The president had expressed the view that archaeological sites belonged to the country and it would be the state that looked after them.

Inclusive approach

THE Buddhist heritage of Sri Lanka is a deeply held sentiment within the country’s ethnic and religious majority, and is often reflected in the state itself. The constitution itself gives the foremost place to Buddhism, although it gives other religions the right to proselytize and to practice. The official logo of the archaeology department is an image of the stupa, which is the most visible component of the country’s Buddhist heritage. The special place of Buddhism in Sri Lanka has been exploited for political purposes by politicians who claim that either the religion or race or both together are at risk, and that if they are voted into power they will protect them and the country. Many of them seem to survive by articulating conspiracy theories to consolidate their nationalistic viewpoints. Only a handful of national level politicians have been willing to counter this parochial nationalism. The current president is one of them.

During the period of the Aragalaya, the venality of the political leaders in power at that time became exposed with the country’s economic collapse. It led to youthful protesters, many from the universities, to voice out that they would not be tricked anymore by such claims and that regardless of race or religion everyone was an equal citizen. It is ironic that after ascending to the pinnacle of the presidency as a result of the Aragalaya that drove out his predecessor, that the president should have moved to silence the youthful voice that called for equality, greater justice and accountability for economic crimes. It would have been better if he had taken the challenge of harnessing their energy and idealism to the great task of building a Sri Lankan nation that is united to develop the country and its economy without robbing it at every possible turn.

The straightforward manner in which the president addressed the officials of the archaeology department is indicative of a value system in which the state is the neutral arbiter of its ethnic and religious plurality. His willingness to speak openly and clearly and to seek to guide the state institutions along an inclusive path would be much appreciated by the ethnic and religious minorities. This rational quality of the president was also seen a few months ago when he advocated the implementation of the 13th amendment to the constitution as mandated by the constitution. Unfortunately, these good intentions have remained in the realm of words only and not yet been translated into implementation on the ground.

Bleak prospects

THE main feature of the 13th amendment is the establishment of a system of devolved power to elected provincial councils that would empower the people of each province to elect their leaders who would govern them in specified subject areas. However, provincial council elections have not been held for over four years and they are non-functional as institutions of devolved power. Instead they are ruled by governors appointed by the president which has made a mockery of the devolution of power. The provincial councils have become administrative bodies run by a presidentially appointed governor who can act, and do act arbitrarily, without consulting the people of the province. It is necessary to revise the provincial council law that gives more powers to the Governors beyond the elected representatives.

Unfortunately, the origins of the provincial council system in the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord in 1987 has caused it to be viewed with a measure of skepticism by the Sinhalese majority as an Indian imposition that would weaken the Sri Lankan state. The Indo-Lanka Peace Accord was controversial when it was signed and continues to be downplayed in the public life of the country. According to it, India agreed to disarm the LTTE and Sri Lanka agreed to establish provincial councils on the Indian model. Neither happened in full measure. Today the non-implementation of the provincial council system has turned them into white elephants as the system has not been implemented as it should be.

The problem with holding provincial council elections starting with the Northern and Eastern provinces is that it can fan Sinhalese apprehension which will be exploited by parochial nationalist groups who are currently displaced from the centre of power. They will have no qualms claiming that the president is favouring the Tamils, paving the way for the domination of the north and east by India, or some other scare mongering claim. If provincial council elections are to be held, they need to be held in the entire country and for all the provinces at one time. In such a situation the government will face the same dilemma it faced in deciding to postpone the local government elections. The prospects for elections in the near future continue to be bleak.

932,Lessons from Karnataka,"— Countercurrents

THE result of the 2023 Karnataka assembly elections has surprised those who, directly or indirectly, had already read its obituary. Congress has secured 136 seats out of 224, and the BJP has managed to retain only 64. However, contrary to the observation of most commentators, Congress was successful not merely because of its local focus. At least three factors solidified Congress’s campaign against the currently dominant Bharatiya Janata Party. Therefore, there are some lessons to be learnt from its political campaign.

The first factor is the politics of courage. In an atmosphere of political gloom where an alternative to the aggressive posturing of the BJP seemed distant, the disposition of courage by Congress leadership in the Karnataka elections refreshed the practice of politics. Compassion and reason were the much-needed antidotes to rescue politics from authoritarian hyperbole. Courage as a political practice, thus, infused politics with almost a redemptive heroic quality to confront cruelty and fear in the service of humanity.

It is no secret that, to some extent, the BJP had successfully exhausted Congress’s energies by dragging its leaders into legal and extra-legal political battles. At a time when Congress did not have sufficient support and was being bullied by all means, its leadership has shown exemplary leadership qualities by practising unflinching defiance of fear and intimidation and demonstrating the much-needed courage and energy to amass popular support. Fortunately, it did not go unnoticed by the electorate. One can argue that the momentum of the mass-contact Bharat Jodo Yatra consolidated the party’s presence in Karnataka too. Its people-oriented campaign did not resort to vague promises but categorically emphasised the significance of peace, harmony and brotherhood. It seems to have clicked with the electorate in Karnataka and hence made a case for a renewed political responsibility based on conscientious citizenship.

The second factor is the disciplined, clear and consistent election campaign and political messaging run by the Congress party. Its campaign focused on relatable notions of civic virtue and liberal ideals such as rights and human dignity. Thus, puncturing the juggernaut of discursive violence of a communal narrative that is self-sustaining and self-serving. From grassroots workers to its top leadership, the party exhibited commendable discipline and astute engagement with popular issues. During this campaign, Congress did not fall prey to the BJP’s trap of communal rhetoric and carefully manoeuvred a few instances where it was cornered in the name of religion and community.

The people-oriented campaign raised issues like inflation and unemployment and, unlike BJP, did not invoke abstract fears and inconsequential sectarianism. The clarity and consistency of political messaging provided a shot in the arm for Congress’s campaign. The electorate responded to the political messaging of the Congress party and realised the dangers of zero-sum game politics. The form of politics has triumphed over the force of politics. Reason and dialogue emerge as significant medium to restore political hope.

The last but the most potent was the politics of love, inclusion and humanity. Toleration and civility were the central pillars of the Congress campaign. The ideological thrust of such ideas creates meaningful coordination between various aspects of public and private life, thus offering a radical configuration of political engagement. It emerged as a formula that redefines obscure junctures where commonalities overtake differences. As the famous French philosopher Alain Badiou has observed in his work In Praise of Love that love is an existential project and, therefore, a constant unravelling quest for truth. Badiou’s analysis proposes that the moment or point of engagement is a moment of encounter. This encounter transforms the relationship between two parties by challenging them ‘to see the world from the point of view of two rather than one.’ Badiou understands it as love’s most concrete transfiguration. Thus, the politics of love is a magnificent quest to explore and celebrate differences and dilutes our obsession with ourselves.

As they say, with great power comes great responsibility. Congress faces a challenging task that ranges from diffusing any party infighting, posing as a unified organisation and meeting the expectations of the state’s people, keeping in mind the impact their governance model can have on potentially reviving their fortune in the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The Karnataka results must not be seen as momentary but as the symptom of a legitimacy deficit of the BJP government and its policies.

933,The hidden hand of the IMF in Sudan’s crisis,"— Peoples Dispatch

SUDAN is experiencing its fourth week of conflict between two military factions, which has caused the death of over 700 people.

Sudanese civilians have fled the capital and the country altogether while the fighting continues with no end in sight. Commentators have so far focused on the military factions and ethnic conflicts.

A reductive explanation has been given for the food crisis in Sudan; such as economic crisis, climate change and the Ukraine war. The significance of macroeconomic policies and the institutions that promote them at the root of these crises tend to be overlooked.

Toppling over the breadbasket

THE IMF imposed liberalisation in Sudan, particularly in the agricultural sector, to promote exports. Liberalisation means removing any barriers to trade and eliminating obstacles to foreign investment, while at the same time reducing the size and power of the government to regulate the economy.

Orthodox economics is the ideology of the rich and powerful. Poor countries trying to develop like Sudan cannot afford a regime of free trade. Sudan should have been left to develop its agricultural sector to serve its own people first.

Seeing Sudan in the news now, it’s hard to imagine that it was once destined to be the ‘breadbasket of Africa.’ Sudan is not only rich in oil and minerals, but also arable land.

As explained in Oxfam’s 2002 report, rapid agricultural liberalisation was a key cause of rising poverty and food insecurity in Africa. The consequences are still experienced to this day.

Liberalisation policies are also eerily similar to extractive practices in the colonial era; in this case, turning Sudan into the world’s farm while the people starve. Back then, there were also local and not-so-local businesses and politicians who facilitated the colonial powers in extracting Africa’s riches and exploiting its labour force.

Sudan has a diverse population of over 600 ethnic groups speaking 400 languages, with Islam being the predominant religion. The country has experienced two civil wars, three coup d’états and a 30-year military dictatorship under Omar Al-Bashir that ended in 2019 following an uprising.

A transitional government was established under prime minister Abdalla Hamdok, but it was fragile and in October 2021, the military dissolved the government and placed the prime minister under house arrest, leading to protests and violent crackdowns that have resulted in more than 100 civilian deaths and many more injuries.

The IMF has long been involved with Sudan. To date, Sudan has undergone at least 11 IMF programs in between civil wars and conflicts. Between 1979 and 1985 alone, under Nimeiri’s regime, there were five IMF loan programs in Sudan. Outside of the programs, the IMF maintained counsel to the government, giving policy advice that would ‘help’ Sudan’s creditworthiness and access to the international market.

From the start of their relationship, Sudan has been in the weaker position. Highly ambitious development projects in the 1970s combined with years of ill-advised investments left the country in a severe deficit and with no bargaining power against international institutions and foreign powers.

The IMF dealt with Sudan in a very autocratic manner, handing down conditionalities and expecting the Sudanese government to implement them with no care of how it’s done.

An unusual feature of the IMF-Sudan relationship was that Sudan was almost always expected to conceive and implement austerity on its own, prior to receiving loans.

The IMF also dealt with Sudan harshly, cutting off credits and aid at the slightest sign of non-compliance or policy disagreement and imposing increasingly severe terms. The dynamic was so perplexing that scholars used Sudan as a case study to understand power struggle in IMF programs.

Protests, riots, coup, repeat

IMF ‘riots’ took place many times in Sudan throughout the 1970s and ’80s because of cuts in subsidies and currency devaluation which made basic commodities expensive.

For a large and diverse country divided by factions like Sudan, such policies quickly turned to social unrest. One of these protests in 1985 led to a coup d’etat when the military intervened.

Scholars have studied social unrest during IMF programs over the past 40 years and found a correlation with coup d’états. IMF programs create winners and losers among both common people and regime elites, leading the ‘losing’ elites to put up a new leader who is more likely to reject conditionalities unfavourable to their interests.

Sudan’s diverse nature and complex historical context have contributed to internal conflicts in the country. The IMF’s push for foreign investments has brought in foreign actors with their own interests, further complicating matters and making Sudan a hotbed for geopolitical struggles and power plays.

In 2012, anti-austerity protests brought thousands of people to the streets of the capital, Khartoum. Citizens were angry over the fuel-subsidy cuts imposed by the IMF combined with rising inflation and called for Bashir to leave the presidency.

Clashes ensued. It also led to another coup d’etat attempt which ultimately failed.

Still, the IMF pushed for subsidy cuts demanding the government ‘communicate the shortcomings of price subsidies and the urgency of the need for reform.’

It noted that cuts should be implemented gradually, while also acknowledging that ‘given the unstable political conditions, [subsidy reform] should be launched ahead of any further price increase.’

Subsidies may just be a numbers game to the IMF, but for the people, it is a social contract that lets them know that the government takes care of their wellbeing, especially in times of crisis. Protests continued into 2013 and a violent crackdown ensued with a death toll up to 230.

The present conflict in Sudan has its roots in December 2018, when then president Omar al-Bashir ended subsidies on fuel and wheat, again, in accordance with the IMF’s recommendations.

This time the coup against Bashir was successful. But the protests and violent crackdowns that continued until after the military took over once again cost hundreds of lives before finally a compromise was reached and a transitional government was formed.

Given this track record, it was a surprise when the civilian prime minister Hamdok entered into another IMF program in 2021 when it was supposed to be turning over a new leaf. Subsidy cuts began in 2020 prior to the signing of the agreement while the country was battling the Covid -19 pandemic and facing other challenges.

Since October 2021, the Sudanese people have protested the military takeover at the cost of hundreds of lives. On the surface, the ‘international community’ seemed to punish the military coup by suspending aid and debt relief, but on the ground, the military regime was given a seat at the negotiating table and perhaps even a position of priority in dictating the ‘peace terms.’

On the other hand, the demand from the people had been clear all along that they wanted justice, an end to the military regime and most importantly, a complete restructuring of Sudan’s economy so that the needs of the people could be served.

A real transformative process can only begin with first understanding the root causes of the people’s discontent, for example, by acknowledging that the military elites not only brutalise any form of dissent but also control the majority of Sudan’s natural resources which they use for themselves and foreign actors.

It is crucial to ensure that civil society organisations are given a priority seat at the negotiating table so that the voices of the common people can be heard and taken into account.

934,"A deep-sea port, an Indian transit, or a US military base?","DURING the Cold War, America strongly opposed the division of Pakistan because the Muslim-majority country was a valuable ally against the Soviet Union. After East Pakistan became Bangladesh with the help of India and the Soviet Union, the Nixon administration did not show support for the new country. They believed that Bangladesh was closely aligned with Indira Gandhi, who was pro-Soviet and disliked by secretary Henry Kissinger. In fact, Kissinger referred to Bangladesh as a ‘basket case’.

Following the violent removal of Mujib and his pro-Soviet regime in August 1975, the relationship between Dhaka and Washington shifted. The US became an active development partner of Bangladesh, while the World Bank, IMF, and various development agencies in the West had already implemented development projects in response to the devastating Famine of 1974. Throughout Bangladesh’s various elected and unelected regimes, Dhaka and Washington had a functional relationship until the Hasina regime, known for its corruption and autocratic practices, had faced disapproval from the World Bank and Washington for attempting to solicit kickbacks during the Padma bridge construction project in 2012. The situation caused Washington to experience cold shoulder syndrome.

For a period of time, until China emerged as a development and security partner of Bangladesh following the controversial parliamentary elections in 2018, Washington and Dhaka had a positive understanding. It’s widely believed these elections were rigged and sponsored by Beijing to keep Hasina in power. After the rigged polls of 2018, China became the primary overseer of Bangladesh’s infrastructure development projects, obviously to the discomfiture of America and its allies in the West and East, including Japan. For several years, China has been the primary source of military equipment for the country, which is worth mentioning.

Meanwhile, the growing tension between China and Taiwan, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and last but not least, China’s friendship with Russia and other adversaries of America have caused concern in Washington. It’s now important for the US to make a decisive decision about how to handle China, Russia, and their allies, such as Bangladesh. India’s relationship with Russia and its tense ties with China have mixed reactions in Washington. The US can’t openly support India’s relationship with Russia, but it also cannot afford to disengage from India, particularly in the event of a conflict with China.

Given the context, it appears that America is interested in establishing a military base in the Bay of Bengal, which is in close proximity to the strategically important Strait of Malacca, likely as a response to China’s actions. The unanswered question is whether Matarbari will serve as a transit for India and a military base for America! The agreement between Japan and Bangladesh to build a deep-sea port at Matarbari using Japanese funds and expertise was preceded by Sheikh Hasina’s recent statement in parliament on April 10. In her speech, she criticised the US for engaging in ‘regime change’ operations in Muslim-majority countries and accused them of being a nasty hegemonic power. Sheikh Hasina also mentioned that the Biden administration was annoyed by her refusal to grant the US a military base in the Bay of Bengal.

However, seemingly, Japan is acting as a ‘distant NATO member’ in the best interests of America, which consequently benefits India. However, Bangladesh may not benefit much from this arrangement and could potentially still be targeted by China if tensions escalate between China and America. The proposed deep-sea port in Bangladesh will not bring significant profits to the country either. Despite using Bangladeshi roads, railways, and rivers for transportation between Kolkata and Agartala, India’s transit fees are much lower than what experts predicted in 2010. Therefore, building another transit at Matarbari will not benefit Bangladesh financially. The country will also have to bear the expenses of maintaining the port and repaying the loan to Japan for its construction. This situation puts Bangladesh in a difficult and risky position.

To achieve success in Bangladesh, the US needs to negotiate with India. Recently, Derek Chollet, counsellor of the state department, travelled from Dhaka to Delhi to facilitate these negotiations. Japanese prime minister Kishida did the same thing. Recently, he went to Delhi to meet prime minister Modi days before Hasina’s state visit to Japan. The US is also allowing Japan to construct a deep-sea port in the Bay of Bengal that won’t be operational for several years. However, these facilities could potentially serve as a naval base for the United States. The construction of the port is believed to be a tactic for the United States to exert pressure on China. Additionally, it appears that Japan’s prime minister Kishida’s recent meeting with Modi in Delhi suggests that the port will also serve India as a transit point to connect its landlocked northeast with the Indian Ocean.

The Matarbari project is expected to positively impact India’s economy, potentially transforming its northeast region into a thriving industrial hub. This could lead to better political integration of the ‘Seven Sisters’ in the northeast with India. Additionally, a more integrated India would be less vulnerable to Chinese invasion and could stabilise the region. However, unless America, Japan, and their allies invest significantly in industrialisation in and around Matarbari, there may be little benefit for Bangladesh. The country would only have a deep-sea port and a large debt burden for decades, similar to Sri Lanka’s situation. Bangladesh’s decision to permit India to use alternative transit routes through Bangladesh and Matarbari to the Siliguri Corridor, also known as the ‘Chicken Neck,’ may result in Chinese military retaliation against the country. The Hasina administration has been criticised by the Chinese ambassador for getting too close to some ‘third countries’ (US and Japan) that are hostile towards China. Such criticism suggests that retaliation is a probable outcome.

Some analysts and experts might believe that America may be considering the establishment of a military base in the Bay of Bengal with Japan’s help. However, we should ask ourselves if this is the best course of action for Bangladesh. Additionally, we should consider if a deep-sea port is necessary and if Matarbari can replicate Singapore’s success. The answer to both of these questions is ‘no’. Bangladesh already has two seaports, Chattogram and Mongla, which are more than enough. This is clear from the fact that Bangladesh has proposed to India to use their existing seaports.

It’s time to contain China which has no qualms with promoting brutal autocratic regimes across the world. Tibet and Xinjiang are glaring examples of gross violations of all principles of democracy, freedom, and human rights within its annexed territories. China’s public support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine is another example in this regard. We know rogue and pariah regimes in North Korea, Myanmar, Cambodia, and among others, Bangladesh, wouldn’t have survived without China’s support. Having no respect for people’s right to self-determination, China wants to annex Taiwan. Last but not least, China’s not-so-subtle threats to India to grab chunks of its territory in the name of ‘undoing the past mistakes’ aren’t congenial to global peace and order. As ‘regime change’ by any superpower is obnoxious, so is any threat to alter the political geography of sovereign nations in the post-World War II era deplorable.

In the past, military pacts and bases strategically located have been used to contain rogue powers. However, it is important to respect the sovereignty of each country and consult with them before establishing a military base. In a democratic society, the majority should have the final decision. No country should be forced to sign an agreement allowing a foreign military base. Unfortunately, the unelected Hasina administration failed to publicly discuss the deep-sea port project with Japanese assistance, leading to speculation about the potential for a US military base in the Bay of Bengal. Transparency builds trust and lack of trust can lead to conflicts and wars. In summary, Hasina’s unpopularity in Bangladesh and diplomatic failures have caused an imbalance.

In summary, Hasina’s lack of popularity in Bangladesh and her failure to maintain a balance between the US and China have weakened her leadership. By favouring America and Japan, Hasina has alienated China, as evidenced by the Chinese ambassador’s warning to her regime. The Matarbari project could be detrimental to Hasina’s authoritarian leadership, while benefiting Delhi, Washington, and Tokyo. There is a possibility that a pro-Chinese military coup may remove her from power.

936,Iraq: Political crisis and solutions,"— New Eastern Outlook

AS THE world watches the various elections (for instance, the upcoming elections in Turkey) and the transfer of power from one government to another, doubts and criticism of the current ‘Iraqi Formula’ are growing. Iraq, meanwhile, continues to grapple with never-ending crises, fuelling speculation both at home and abroad about the need for ‘real change’ that will replace the dominant political figures who have been on the scene for two decades. In other words, after its brazen aggression in 2003, the United States is trying to impose its protégés on Baghdad, who will loyally pursue a pro-American policy.

Despite the creation of numerous US programs and plans ostensibly aimed at solving problems and crises, Iraq is still seen as a place where such problems are deeply rooted through the fault of the west. Even though there have been several ‘celebrations’ in American and European research institutes and centres, customary for a situation of setting up the electoral process or installing a new administration, no progress has been achieved. One of the paradoxes of the situation in Iraq is that even the major western institutions that have been persistently imposed on the country over the past two decades and that have called for support for the 2003 American invasion have recently become very focused on the shortcomings in the political, economic and even security systems in Iraq. They also began to express concern about the shortcomings that Iraqis had gained from the war and the democratic process based on the ‘2005 Constitution’, especially in connection with the 20th anniversary of the Washington-led invasion. In addition, informed political sources told the Shafaq news agency that ‘there is a great international desire to bring about real change in the political process in Iraq by changing the current political faces and this desire enjoys strong support from society, despite fierce resistance from the United States and the United Kingdom.’

This is in line with the sentiments of a large part of Iraqis, who in 2019 expressed their desire to overthrow the ruling political class through a widespread protest movement in many cities and governorates (provinces). They were convinced that the politicians who dominated the Iraqi scene after the invasion had done nothing to solve people’s problems, such as providing electricity, other basic services and job creation before maintaining the country’s security and sovereignty. These failures translated into the collapse of Iraqi security when ISIS (banned in Russia) swept through the country, or when the Green Zone, which was supposed to be a symbol of security and stability in Baghdad, turned into a battlefield of armed factions in the summer of 2022, when the political struggle over election results and government formation reached its peak.

According to informed political sources, work on an international movement to achieve real change in the political process is ‘steadily intensifying, but there is no date yet for launching the movement on the ground.’ The same sources further state that ‘The International Movement for Change in Iraq emerged in light of reports by the UN and international organisations that revealed the extent of corruption, destruction and murder in Iraq in recent years, without any real change from the ruling political class in recent years.’ According to the aforementioned sources, there is a lack of optimism about the Al-Sudani government and any support for it is merely a matter of protocol, especially given that the international community views it as a government of armed groups. However, it is somehow forgotten that this whole system was created by American aggressors, who want to turn oil-rich Iraq into their faithful satellite.

While the formation of the cabinet of Al-Sudani, a candidate of the Shiite Coordination Framework bloc, has inspired optimism outside Iraq at the official level, the nation has experienced an unpleasant general course of political and security developments over the past 20 years, which has caused concern both inside and outside Iraq. It was hoped that this would lead to a system that guaranteed Iraqi citizens their minimum rights. Iraqi politician Samir Obaid believes that ‘the expected change in Iraq is long delayed because of the strong cohesion of the corruption system and the lack of unity in society to fight corruption because of the scourge of ignorance to which the political class has been deliberately indulged for the past 20 years. Change is inevitable because the ruling political elite put in place by Washington has alienated 90 per cent of the Iraqi population, is shunned by the countries of the region because of its corruption and deception, and has undermined trust in the American suzerain in Iraq and throughout the region.’ He goes on to add that ‘change will not come through Iraqi streets or military intervention, but by exposing the corrupt individuals who have violated human rights and participated in the killing of Iraqis. The international community and the UN will also assist in exposing key corruption cases.’ This movement will begin soon, and Iraq will be rid of the corrupt and 80 per cent ruling political class in 2023, the Iraqi politician naively believes.

Moreover, many experts, pundits and even former American politicians have repeatedly discussed the shortcomings of the US inability to deal with the concept of ‘the day after tomorrow,’ which comes after military success. It turned out that Iraq was not sufficiently prepared for the stage of creating a new state, satisfied with a quick fix to strengthen the quota system in order to appease local forces and parties, a system that had completely compromised itself. According to a recent article by Sajad Jiyad of The Century Foundation, ‘Regime change was supposed to make Iraq a beacon for the Middle East, but state-building, as the United States has succeeded, has definitely failed.’ As a result, according to local sources, the political elite is holding numerous unannounced meetings with the parties to avoid it and give them a chance for just two years. Moreover, it is surprising that more than six months after taking office, prime minister Al-Sudani has still not received an invitation to visit Washington.

According to sources, the Kurdistan region will remain distant from the international movement for change in Iraq as a whole. Nevertheless, local newspapers write, there will still be a push for many reforms while curbing corruption, especially as international support for the region continues at various levels. Moreover, many experts and researchers have already characterised the Iraqi regime as having become a dysfunctional kleptocracy following the rule of a former dictatorship skilfully imposed on Iraq by official Washington.

According to experts, the democratic system established by the 2005 constitution, while facilitating relatively peaceful processes of change, has failed to produce new political elites who believe in the inevitable nature of change. This has led to the introduction of quotas and other problems that drove hundreds of thousands of Iraqis to protest three years ago. In addition, a large part of the Iraqi population is convinced that the ruling class is actively preventing genuine reform, consolidating its power and influence through the armed forces and the media, and trying to influence the judiciary and parliament by using state funds and the existing corrupt system. Once again, we would like to recall that all these ‘agreements’ were imposed on Iraqi society by the great ‘democrats’ from the United States.

Barham Salih, former president of Iraq, recently wrote an article in the American magazine Foreign Policy advocating radical changes in government. Salih stressed that the system put in place after 2003 had reached its ‘end,’ and suggested amending the constitution to create a stronger presidential system. One of the most eloquent references in the article is that he condemns the post-2003 regime, stating that it was installed out of fear, with each Shiite, Kurdish and Sunni component having its own problems, resulting in a structurally weak state. Salih also stated that this system was over and that Iraq needed a new social and political contract as well as a historic pact between state and society, including amendments to the 2005 constitution.

The growing awareness that Iraq needs profound and radical change is reflected in Salih’s views, as well as in the thoughts of several researchers and experts on Iraqi politics. Politician Faiq Al Sheikh Ali shocked many when he stated that the deadline for the fall of the current regime in Iraq with the help of an ‘international team,’ which he called a ‘destructive force,’ would be 2024. This statement sparked much discussion and expectation. Sheikh Ali stated that after previously warning against overthrowing Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship, he is now doing the same for the current regime. Sheikh Ali stressed that the new government that would come to power would be ‘strong and ferocious,’ but not a dictatorship and that it ‘would be destructive and would not spare corrupt politicians.’ He also stressed that the role of religious authority will return to the previous era, and the new regime will not allow Iran or Turkey to interfere in Iraqi affairs. Sheikh Ali stated that the next regime may not be parliamentary, but it will be civilian, not military. In addition, he advised that the Kurdistan region should adapt to the coming changes.

On the other hand, although the current regime has demonstrated its inability to govern the state, one must admit that the challenges facing it are significant because it does not represent the majority and there is a significant part of the population that is not convinced of its effectiveness. At this point there is no sign of an international movement for change. Real change begins only with the unification of national forces opposed to the quota approach. But change from abroad, in this case from the United States, if it comes, will be no better than the change of 2003, which has had a very negative impact on the formation of a modern state in Iraq so far.

937,The trouble with Taiwan,"— Counter Punch

TAIWAN is a country, but not many other states recognise it as such. Only 13 countries maintain diplomatic relations with the island nation. These are small or poor or both like Haiti, Paraguay and Tuvalu. Honduras switched its diplomatic allegiance from Taipei to Beijing just one month ago.

Taiwan doesn’t have a seat at the United Nations and it has been blocked from joining international bodies like the World Health Organisation. It tries hard but rarely manages to function as a member of the international community.

For a country with around 23 million people and the twentieth largest economy in the world, it might seem strange that Taiwan gets so little respect. But Mainland China claims the island as part of its own territory. And few countries, including the United States, have been willing to challenge Beijing directly on that issue.

Of course, the United States has long challenged China indirectly by providing enormous amounts of military assistance to Taiwan (with a huge bump up during the Trump presidency) and serving as the country’s second leading trade partner for goods (Taiwan is also the tenth largest US trade partner).

Moreover, despite an official policy of ambiguity, the United States has provided a number of veiled promises to Taiwan that it will intervene on its behalf in the event of an attack from China.

This latter promise has many analysts in the United States concerned about a looming superpower conflict with China over Taiwan. A number of Washington think tanks have conducted simulations of such a war. Then, On April, the new House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, created by Republican leader Kevin McCarthy when he took over as House speaker in February, also gamed out a Chinese invasion.

‘We are well within the window of maximum danger for a Chinese Communist Party invasion of Taiwan, and yesterday’s war-game stressed the need to take action to deter CCP aggression and arm Taiwan to the teeth before any crisis begins,’ the committee chairman told the press.

Writing in The Nation, Michael Klare warns of the possibility that a real-life conflict between the two superpowers would quickly escalate to the nuclear level: ‘Should the US experience significant setbacks — such as the loss of its prized aircraft carriers — might Washington not just as easily brandish or detonate a nuclear weapon in an effort to end Chinese involvement in the war?’

The Taiwanese have long lived under the threat of invasion. The political sphere is divided between those who favour a self-declared independent Taiwan and those who prefer accommodation with the Mainland alongside possible reunification in the future. The two parties that represent those options have alternated in office for the last two decades after the more pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party defeated the more accommodationist Kuomintang Party for the first time in 2000.

The DPP has been at the head of government since 2016, and relations with China have deteriorated considerably. But the DPP did poorly in last November’s local election. The ‘blue’ coalition led by the KMT believes it has a fair chance of regaining the lead from the ‘green’ coalition led by the DPP in next year’s presidential elections.

There isn’t much middle ground between the two, particularly on the issue of China, even though polling suggests that the vast majority of the country favours the status quo: not pushing for outright independence and not moving toward reunification as soon as possible.

‘Fear of conflict with China is tearing at tolerance, civility and our confidence in the democratic society we have painstakingly built,’ writes Yingtai Lung, a former culture minister of Taiwan in The New York Times. ‘When 37 current and former Taiwan scholars last month issued an open letter calling for Taipei to chart a middle path between China and the United States and criticising US ‘militarism,’ they were attacked as naïve and soft on China.’

Like South Korea in its relations with North Korea, Taiwan doesn’t have the option of relocating to another part of the globe. One way or another, it has to learn how to live with Beijing.

So far, coexistence has meant fluctuating tensions in the Taiwan Strait separating the two countries combined with considerable economic cooperation. The United States may be Taiwan’s second leading trade partner but its first is China. Beijing relies on high-tech imports from Taiwan, especially the semiconductor industry, while Taiwan depends on a wide range of imports. In 2022, Taiwan imported $84 billion of goods while exporting $121 billion to the Mainland. These numbers seem virtually unaffected by political tensions between the two countries.

But the level of trade doesn’t predict everything. Ukrainian exports to Russia actually showed a modest uptick in 2021 while Russian exports to Ukraine surged quite a bit at that time: this just prior to the Russian invasion in February 2022. Taiwan can’t assume that a booming trade relationship is a guarantee that China won’t invade.

What might be a more reassuring factor, however, has been Russia’s recent experience of war. The Kremlin failed to take over Ukraine and the war has adversely affected Russia’s economy and international reputation. Surely, China has watched how the much smaller Ukraine has managed to survive the initial invasion, lock down Russia in a costly conflict and garner international support to expel the invaders.

Taiwan is a much wealthier country than Ukraine and it expects the United States to come to its direct assistance. Any conflict across the Taiwan Strait will thus have an even more devastating effect militarily and on the global economy than the current war in Ukraine, even if the war in East Asia stops short of a nuclear exchange.

Taiwan can count on one thing, though. China has been singularly focused on economic growth for more than three decades. Unlike Russia, it seems unwilling to sacrifice the country’s economic well-being on the pyre of nationalism, even if those fires have been burning more brightly in recent years.

The United States and its allies would be well-advised not to do anything to encourage Chinese nationalism. Practical cooperation on climate change and the global economy would not only be mutually beneficial but would also reduce the likelihood of war across the Taiwan Strait. Wherever one stands on the independence vs. accommodation spectrum in Taiwan, everyone should agree that a war is in nobody’s interest.

938,Inter win Milan derby to reach Champions League final,"Inter Milan forward Lautaro Martinez (C) celebrates with fans after scoring his team’s opening goal against AC Milan during the UEFA Champions League semi-final second leg match at the San Siro on Tuesday. — AFP photo

Inter Milan reached their first Champions League final for 13 years as Lautaro Martinez’s sole goal of the match gave them a 3-0 aggregate win against AC Milan on Tuesday.

Inter will undoubtedly be the underdogs against either Real Madrid or Manchester City in Istanbul on June 10, but the way they managed both legs of this all-Milan tie suggests they will be hard to beat.

The key moment of the night at the San Siro came when Argentinian Martinez exchanged passes with substitute Romelu Lukaku and drilled a shot from inside the penalty area that Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan allowed in at his near post.

Martinez, Inter’s captain, hailed the cohesion of his team over the two matches against their city rivals.

‘What counts is the squad. I experienced it at the World Cup (with Argentina),’ he said.

‘It makes it easy if you have a united squad with everyone pulling in the same direction. It means you get to play these very important matches in the best possible way.’

He added: ‘After winning the World Cup and experiencing what is the pinnacle for a player I knew we could reach this final, and we did it.’

His goal effectively killed off the tie.

Trailing 2-0 from the first leg, Milan had pushed hard in the first half, spearheaded by Rafael Leao who shot across the goal and past the post with one of his side’s best chances.

Maignan then superbly dropped to his knees to collect Edin Dzeko’s glancing header from Hakan Calhanoglu’s pacy free-kick.

Lukaku’s introduction in the second half proved the spark that Inter needed to extend their lead.

Absent for much of the season with injuries and with a damaged reputation following a disastrous World Cup with Belgium, Lukaku has slowly worked his way back to his best.

The forward on loan from Chelsea immediately caused problems in the Milan defence and created Martinez’s goal to guarantee their place in their first Champions League final since the last time they won European club football’s biggest prize under Jose Mourinho in 2010.

‘Tutti a Istanbul’, the joyous Inter fans sang with the Nerazzurri now one game away from a fourth Champions League title.

Inter coach Simone Inzaghi said: ‘It’s a dream come true. We always believed we could do it, we have had an extraordinary journey (to the final).

‘What pleased me? Everything. The running, the determination, the concentration... they were very good.’

Facing Inzaghi’s men will be either Manchester City or record 14-time winners Real Madrid, with that semi-final finely poised at 1-1 ahead of Wednesday’s decider at City’s Etihad Stadium.

‘We’re going to have to give it our all,’ Martinez said.

Milan’s coach Stefano Pioli was left to contemplate a harsh ending to ‘a terrific’ run to the last four.

‘It’s normal to be disappointed after losing in the semi-final, especially in a derby.

‘The players gave their all in both legs but Inter deserved it. They played better than us, winning both matches.

‘Given our journey and what we’ve done over the past three years it would have been fabulous to get to the final. But we didn’t make it, that’s a massive disappointment.’",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201885/inter-win-milan-derby-to-reach-champions-league-final,2023-05-18 10:36:39,newagebd
939,Bangladesh get mighty Lebanon,"All India Football Federation president Kalyan Chaubey shows Bangladesh’s name during the draw ceremony of the SAFF Championship 2023 in New Delhi, India, on Wednesday. — Courtesy photo

Bangladesh were placed alongside mighty Lebanon, the Maldives, and Bhutan in Group B as the draw of the eight-nation SAFF Championship 2023 was held in New Delhi, India, on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Group A features eight-time champions India, debutants Kuwait, Nepal, and Pakistan.

The tournament is scheduled to be held in Bengaluru from June 21 to July 4, with the two teams — Lebanon and Kuwait —participating from outside the SAFF region.

Spanish coach Javier Cabrera’s charges Bangladesh will start their group campaign by taking on Lebanon on June 22 before facing the Maldives and Bhutan on June 25 and 28, respectively.

The top two teams from each group will advance to the semi-finals, to be held on July 1, before the final on July 4.

SAFF general secretary Anwarul Huq Helal, All India Football Federation president Kalyan Chaubey, and AIFF secretary general Shaji Prabhakaran were present, among others, during the draw ceremony.

Among the participating nations, Bangladesh (192nd) are ahead of only Pakistan (195th) in the FIFA rankings, while Lebanon (99th) are ranked top ahead of India (101st), the Maldives (154th), Nepal (174th), and Bhutan (185th).

Bangladesh won the SAFF title once in 2003 and finished runners-up twice in 1999 and 2005. The last time Bangladesh reached the semi-finals was in 2009, but after that, they could not overcome the group stage hurdle in the last five editions.

India have won the title the most, eight times, as the Maldives have won twice, and Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal each clinched it once, apart from Bangladesh.

Despite the poor rankings and record, Cabrera believed that his charges had the capacity to reach the semi-finals.

‘Definitely, we want to be in the semi-finals, and we have to (be),’ Cabrera told reporters in his immediate reaction after the draw.

‘It’s a challenging group... We have got the highest ranked Lebanon in our group, but we are quite positive. We believe that, again, if we are able to perform at our level, (what) we have to do, we will have chances,’ said the Spaniard.

Lebanon are not unfamiliar to Bangladesh, as both faced off twice earlier in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers in July 2011, when Bangladesh lost the away game by 4-0 and won the home game by 2-0 goals.

However, Cabrera on May 14 called 35 players into his preliminary squad before their training camp at the Bashundhara Sports Complex in the city on June 4.

He will trim the squad to 27-man before flying to Cambodia to play a preparation match on June 15.

Bangladesh will fly to Bangalore from Phnom Penh on June 16 to take part in the SAFF.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201938/bangladesh-get-mighty-lebanon,2023-05-18 10:36:40,newagebd
940,Afif told to concentrate batting on at number 7,"Afif Hossain

Prominent coach Nazmul Abedeen Fahim adviced Bangladesh national team batsman Afif Hossain to establish him at number seven position, as it would both help him and the team in the long run.

Since there have been plenty of qualified candidates for the number seven position for the past couple of years, the Bangladesh team management will undoubtedly face some challenges in getting any particular batsman set in that position.

Alongside Afif and veteran Mahmudullah, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Yasir Ali, Mosaddek Hossain, and Mohammad Saifuddin have also played at seven from time to time, but none got properly settled in that position, especially after Mahmudullah got axed from the side.

However, after others had failed to fill the position in prior attempts, Mehidy proved himself worthy of the team management’s trust by batting well at number seven.

After the start of Afif’s international career back in February 2018, the 23-year-old featured in 11 innings at number four for Bangladesh, where he made 303 runs at an average of 33.67 with a strike rate of 115.21.

The right-hander also batted at number five, where he scored 331 at an average of 20.69 with an impressive strike of 130.31.

However, considering the recent performances of star performers like Shakib Al Hasan and Towhid Hridoy in those positions, Fahim adviced Afif to start planning to bat at number seven while making some fundamental changes to his batting approach.

‘It will be better if Afif can play at number seven and bring some changes to his batting approach. Perhaps there is still an opportunity for him [on the national team]. Since Towhid, Shakib, and Mushfiq are playing at four, he [Afif] has a thin chance to get a chance to bat at that position,’ Fahim told reporters at Mirpur on Wednesday.

‘At the same time, if Afif thinks that he plays better at four and he should play there; it would make his task difficult to bat at seven. But if he acknowledges that he doesn’t have a choice other than batting at seven and he has to settle there, it would be ideal for him,’ Fahim added.

Fahim also asserted that the Tigers have gained a lot of positives from the recent tour of England, as they clinched the three-match one-day international series 2-0 against Ireland.

‘We have returned with a lot of positives given the conditions in England. Although we couldn’t show proper intent in the series opener, we showed it in the next two games, which played a pivotal role in winning those matches against the Irish,’ he said.

‘We have chased a massive total in the second game while defending a humble total in the series finale.’

Fahim also praised Nazmul Hossain Shanto for his brilliant batting, as well as his cameo performances in bowling and fielding during the Ireland series, and believed his batting played a pivotal role in the side’s good performance.

‘A few of us played really well during the critical conditions; like Shanto’s steady, continuous, steady batting at three, it was something really special, as number three has always been termed a pillar of batting for any side.’",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201937/afif-told-to-concentrate-batting-on-at-number-7,2023-05-18 10:36:41,newagebd

After the Test, the visitors will depart for India on June 19 to feature in a series against the home side.

After the conclusion of the ODIs, both sides will move to Sylhet to take part in the two T20Is that are scheduled to be played on July 14 and 16 at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium.

Earlier, both sides were expected to play three Tests alongside a similar number of T20Is.

However, considering Tiger’s hectic schedule, which incorporates the forthcoming Asia Cup in September followed by the ICC World Cup 2023 in October-November in India, BCB has scrapped a Test and a T20I from the fixtures.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201936/afghanistan-to-arrive-on-june-10,2023-05-18 10:36:42,newagebd
942,Jr Tigers lose lone T20 against Pakistan,"Pakistan Under-19 team ended Bangladesh tour on a high after beating the hosts by four wickets in the one-off T20 match at the Shaheed Kamruzzaman Stadium in Rajshahi on Wednesday.

With the win, Pakistan completed a tour sweep. The visitors won the only youth Test by 10 wickets before winning the five-match youth ODI series by 4-1. It meant, they lost only one match in the tour. Put into bat first, junior Tigers were able to score 159-5 with opener Jishan Alam hitting highest 52. He took only 26 balls for his knock that included five fours and two sixes.

However his quick start was not enough to take the side to the big total, largely due to the failure of the other batsmen. Ariful Islam was the other notable contributor with 30.

Ahmed Hussain claimed 2-25 for Pakistan while Ali Asfand, Amir Hasan and Muhammad Tahir picked up one wicket apiece. Opener Shamyl Hussain hammered a 49 ball-67 as Pakistan raced to victory in 19.1 overs. Arafat Minhaj played a perfect foil to him with 41 off 22.

Since making his debut on the international stage, Bangladesh pacer Taskin Ahmed has had an uphill battle with injuries. Taskin, who is currently preparing to come back from a side strain injury, has been a revolution in the Tigers’ pace bowling unit. While he expressed his desire to come back stronger for the forthcoming ICC World Cup and make significant contributions to the side, he also discussed his bowling and a few other things while talking to Mahibur Hillol of New Age. Here are the excerpts:

New Age: What’s the update about your injury? How is your rehab going?

Taskin Ahmed: The condition of my injury is better than earlier. I have improved.

NA: What is your main goal for the forthcoming ICC World Cup in India?

Taskin: My priority is to make a major contribution to the Bangladesh team in the World Cup and take the side to the final of the mega event.

NA: You are the only pacer of the Bangladesh team who features across all three formats. Do you have any intention to only appear in any particular format to boost your performance in that format?

Taskin: No, to me, playing in all three formats is a matter of pride, and I aim to keep up playing in all the formats. If the Almighty provides me with the ability, I want to continue this way. Pray for my good health.

NA: Do you lament not featuring in the just concluded Ireland series?

Taskin: Yes, I really wanted to play in the series against Ireland since it was held in England. I was missing it greatly when I noticed that bowlers could hit the ball on the seam in the series opener.

NA: Afghanistan are set to arrive in Bangladesh next month to take on the Tigers in a full-fledged series. How competitive do you think the series will be?

Taskin: In recent times, Afghanistan have been playing much better cricket. A lot of their players are making regular appearances in various franchise-based competitions across the globe, which has bolstered their strength to a large extent. I expect the series against them to be very competitive. But we are not lagging behind either, and we have enough firepower to fight them with neck-to-neck.

NA: You have been playing the leading role in Bangladesh’s pace bowling unit. How much does it excite you?

Taskin: I am not thinking the way you are thinking. In fact, we are all leaders when we feature in a game, as everybody needs to give their best efforts in a game to win it.

NA: How much pride lies in being the key pacer of the national team?

Taskin: Not only as a pacer, it’s a matter of huge pride playing for the nation, and I also consider it a lifetime achievement.

NA: How much has Allan Donald contributed to the improvement of your bowling?

Taskin: Of course, he has assisted me to come this far. On top of that, you must have the willpower to perform up to the mark at the top level. Not only me, but Allan is also helping the other pacers on the side. Since he has been with us for a long time, now we also have a better idea of how he functions.

NA: You have been termed as a ‘speedster’ since the start of your career. Aside from speed, what else have you adapted over the years to become a world-class bowler?

Taskin: My discipline and the process I follow while training and playing are getting better as a fast bowler. I have also been going through many different processes for my further development and to become a world-class bowler.

NA: To you, how significant is it to have a partnership in bowling? Have you found someone until today who is a better partner to bowl with?

Taskin: We are all doing great by the grace of the Almighty. It is always beneficial to have a good partner, which is significant. We are all helpful to each other; that’s it.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201853/taskin-aims-to-take-bangladesh-to-wc-final,2023-05-18 10:36:45,newagebd
945,"Pele’s gilded, turf-lined tomb opens to public in Brazil","It is a final resting place fit for ‘The King’: six months after the death of the man widely considered the greatest footballer of all time, Brazil opened Pele’s gilded, football-turfed tomb to the public Monday.

Pele, who died on December 29 at age 82 after a battle with cancer, was laid to rest at the Ecumenical Memorial Cemetery in Santos, Brazil. It is a high-rise, 14-story mausoleum that holds the Guinness world record for the tallest cemetery on Earth.

Fans were greeted by two life-size golden statues of the player nicknamed ‘O Rei’ -- The King -- whose remains rest inside a large golden vault displayed in the middle of a 200-square-meter (more than 2,000-square-foot) room carpeted in artificial turf.

‘It surpassed my expectations. It’s a really beautiful place,’ said Ronaldo Rodrigues, 44, a businessman who was first in line to visit the tomb, along with his wife.

‘I hope lots of tourists will come visit and get to know a little about Pele’s story, what he represented for Santos, Brazil and the entire world.’

Born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, Pele is the only player in history to win three World Cups (1958, 1962 and 1970).

He scored a world record 1,281 goals during his more than two-decade career with Santos (1956-74), the New York Cosmos (1975-77) and the Brazilian national team.

In tears, Pele’s son Edinho told reporters who flocked to the southeastern port city that the family was still struggling to cope with their loss.

‘But we’re also very proud and happy at all the affection and reverence that’s kept pouring in,’ he said.

For now, entries to the tomb are limited to 60 people a day, via a sign-up form on the cemetery’s website.

Topped with a cross, Pele’s golden vault has black etchings on its sides depicting his 1,000th goal and his famous raised-fist goal celebration. The room is wallpapered with images of fans in a football stadium.

The resort-like cemetery also features an auto museum that now includes the Mercedes Benz S-280 the company gave Pele in 1974 to commemorate his 1,000th goal.

‘It’s a place that’s rich in detail, all lovingly assembled in tribute, as the ‘King’ deserves,’ cemetery manager Paulo Campos told AFP.

The mausoleum sits less than a kilometer (0.6 mile) from the Vila Belmiro, the stadium where Pele played most of his storied career.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201854/peles-gilded-turf-lined-tomb-opens-to-public-in-brazil,2023-05-18 10:36:46,newagebd
946,Guardiola eyes CL flourish to ‘exceptional’ City legacy,"Pep Guardiola

Pep Guardiola says his legacy as Manchester City boss is already ‘exceptional’ as the English champions aim to finally turn their domestic dominance into European glory.

City host Real Madrid in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final on Wednesday with the tie delicately poised at 1-1.

Victory over the Spanish giants would put Guardiola’s men in prime position to become just the second side ever to win the treble of Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup in the same season.

City need just one win from their final three Premier League games to guarantee a fifth title in six seasons under Guardiola but they have never been crowned European champions.

They may never have a better chance as the winners of their clash with Madrid will be strong favourites to beat either AC Milan or Inter Milan in next month’s final in Istanbul.

‘My legacy, our legacy is exceptional already,’ Guardiola said at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday.

‘We are not stupid (not) to know how important is tomorrow’s game. It’s one of the most important since we are together here.

‘We cannot deny that, for the competition, for the rival, for many things. I said to the players ‘live it like a huge opportunity, enjoy the moment’.

‘How fortunate we are. We are incredibly lucky to be here. It’s in our hands, it depends on us, we don’t have to do something exceptional, just be ourselves and win one game to reach a final.’

City’s dreams were shattered by a stunning late Madrid fightback when the sides met in last season’s semi-final.

But this time Guardiola’s men crucially have home advantage in the second leg and boast a formidable record at the Etihad.

City have not lost at home in the Champions League for five years and have won all 14 games on home soil in 2023.

‘It’s a dream come true to be here,’ added Guardiola, who twice won the competition as Barcelona coach.

‘We arrive really good for the fact we are in the FA Cup final, one game away to win the Premier League and semi-final of the Champions League, but at the same time we have to play much better than the Madrid (away) game.’

City meet Manchester United -- the only side to have completed the treble -- in the FA Cup final at Wembley on June 3.

As influential as Guardiola has been during his seven years in charge, the transformation in City’s fortunes came long before the Catalan’s arrival, when the club was taken over by Emirati royal Sheikh Mansour in 2008.

Billions of pounds have been poured in on and off the pitch to make City the dominant force in English football.

Defender Kyle Walker said the players owe it to the club’s owners to deliver the Champions League title.

‘The club is missing that one,’ said the England international, whose head-to-head with Madrid star Vincius Junior will be one of the key tussles in the second leg.

‘For the owners, the amount of money they’ve pumped into this club, we owe that to them. We owe it to ourselves as well.’",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201857/guardiola-eyes-cl-flourish-to-exceptional-city-legacy,2023-05-18 10:36:47,newagebd
947,Battle for number 7 spot excites Shakib,"Shakib al Hasan

Ace all-rounder Shakib al Hasan thinks that there are several candidates lined up in the Bangladesh one-day international squad to grab the number seven spot ahead of the forthcoming World Cup to be held in India in October and November.

Bangladesh have been testing Mehidy Hasan Miraz at number seven in the 50-over format since the home series against Ireland in March, and team management appeared to be looking to give him the finisher’s spot that has previously been occupied by different batsmen.

Afif Hossain and Mahmudullah, who failed to retain their spots in the ODIs, are often discussed as leading candidates to fill the number seven spot, while team management carried Yasir Ali in England for the just concluded three-match ODI series against Ireland despite failing to give him a place in the playing XI.

‘From my personal point of view, the competition is not only about one guy; there are many guys for it [the number seven position]. Everyone is performing there, and if you see the domestic circuit, there are Afif [Hossain], Mossadek [Hossain], and Sohan [Nurul Hasan], while Riyad [Mahmudullah] bhai is playing brilliantly. There is Rabbi with the team while Miraz is batting at seven,’ said Shakib on Monday.

‘So there are six to seven options for one place, and so the decision is not easy to make. I am sure, keeping the World Cup in mind, the coach, selectors, and captain will take the right decision.’

Shakib added that he is hopeful to fix the spot before the Asia Cup, while adding that they should back the decision of the team management in this regard irrespective of the result.

The Tigers are slated to play three ODIs against Afghanistan before the Asia Cup, which still looks doubtful under the present situation, but the team management needs to fix the number seven position sooner rather than later.

‘Now we are in the primary stage, and whatever wrong or right we are doing, I think everything will be all right at the World Cup or the Asia Cup,’ he said.

‘We will have our right combination when we go to the World Cup, and it will depend on opposition and condition. In some grounds, four pacers might play, while there will be grounds where you will have two pace bowlers. In some fields, you need six bowlers, while in other places, we will need five bowlers.

‘When the decision is taken, you have to take a lot of things into consideration. Now we are just having trials,’ he said, adding that they need to make sure they don’t repeat similar mistakes that prevented them from going far in the previous World Cup.

‘The condition is always fair in the ICC tournament, and it is even for every team. We have to do well in all the departments if we want to do well. In the last World Cup, we had a good chance but couldn’t capitalise it due to some small mistakes,’ said Shakib.

‘We must make sure that we don’t repeat those mistakes. Certainly other teams are improving in their respective areas, but we have to improve if we want to compete with them,’ he concluded.

Shakib is currently sidelined for six weeks after suffering a finger injury during the second ODI against Ireland that forced him to miss the series finale on Sunday.

948,Bangladesh-US bilateral trade on rise,"While the bilateral trade between Bangladesh and the United States has grown significantly in the past five years in favour of Bangladesh, a decision to stop buying necessary goods from the US may not augur well for Bangladesh, economists said.

Bangladesh’s imports from the US increased by 65.7 per cent in the period between the financial year 2017-18 and 2021-22 while the US imports from Bangladesh grew by 74 per cent in the period.

According to Bangladesh Bank data, the country’s imports from the US in the FY22 stood at $2.82 billion which is 24.58 per cent higher than that of $2.27 billion in FY21.

Bangladesh’s imports from the US in FY18 were $1.7 billion and the figure increased to $1.77 billion in FY19 and $2.12 billion in FY20, the data showed.

Bangladesh mainly imports mineral fuels, mineral oils, scraped irons, oil seeds, including soya bean, cotton, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances.

Against the imports, Bangladesh’s exports to the US stood at $10.42 billion in the FY22, which were $5.98 billion in FY18, Export Promotion Bureau data showed.

The US is the single largest export destination for Bangladesh and the country mainly exports woven garments, knitwear and leather and leather goods to the US market.

Without mentioning any country’s names, prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Saturday said that Bangladesh would not purchase anything from any country if it imposed sanctions.

‘I will not buy anything from those who will give sanctions,’ she said.

In December 2021, the US Treasury Department sanctioned the Rapid Action Battalion and seven of its officials due to their alleged involvement in significant human rights violations.

However, some economists believe that the government’s decision in question may not prove to be a good one for the Bangladesh’s economy.

‘Stopping imports from the US will not be a well thought-out affair and I think it will not happen,’ Policy Research Institute chairman Zaidi Sattar told New Age on Wednesday.

‘We import goods from the US for meeting our needs; the US is not forcing Bangladesh to import. In the same way, the US is also importing apparel and some other goods from Bangladesh,’ he said.

Businesses import goods from countries which provide quality products at competitive prices, he said.

‘If Bangladesh stops importing from the US, some other destinations, including the European countries, could be the substitute of the US. But it is true we import some high-quality items from the US for meeting our requirements,’ Zaidi Sattar said.

The economist said that it was possible for Bangladesh to import the products from alternative sources, but the products which were imported from the US had undoubtedly a high demand in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Faruque Hassan said that the trade and commerce between Bangladesh and the US had been growing over the years and there should not be imposition of any restrictions which could hamper the interests of consumers of both the countries.

‘I think trade issues will remain separate from the political issues,’ he said.

The US was the sixth largest import source for Bangladesh in FY22 and Bangladesh imported mineral fuels, mineral oils and products worth $791.8 million in the financial year.

The BB data showed that Bangladesh imported iron and steel worth $729.5 million, oil seeds and oleaginous fruits, miscellaneous grains and industrial or medicinal plants worth $435.1 million and cotton worth $290.4 million from the US in FY22.

‘For protecting the interests of the country, we should adopt a policy of not linking economic issues with the political ones,’ economist Ahsan H Mansur said.

If Bangladesh imposes trade restriction on any country, they would also impose a ban on imports from Bangladesh, he said.

Keeping economic issues separate from political issues, Bangladesh should work on solving the non-economic issues, Mansur said.

‘We export products worth $10 billion to the US and import from the US products worth $2.8 billion. We have no leverage. So, any decision should have been taken keeping the national interest in mind,’ the economist said.

‘The trade and investment relationship between Bangladesh and the US is strong now and hopefully the political relations would not put any impacts on economic relations of the two countries,’ American Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh president Syed Ershad Ahmed said.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201916/bangladesh-us-bilateral-trade-on-rise,2023-05-18 10:36:48,newagebd
949,EDF cut to $4.77 billion,"The Bangladesh Bank has brought down the volume of Export Development Fund to $4.77 billion from $7 billion in compliance with the International Monetary Fund’s condition to change the calculation of foreign exchange reserves as per international standards.

BB officials said that the size of EDF loans would be further reduced to $2 billion by September.

The IMF has recently suggested that the BB exclude EDF loans from total reserve calculation, which has put pressure on the central bank, as excluding the EDF loan amount will further decrease the foreign reserve amount.

The country’s foreign exchange reserve, which included EDF loans, dropped to $29.8 billion on May 8 from $46 billion in December 2021.

To address this situation, the government established a new fund in January 2023 with Tk 10,000 crore, which will provide low-interest loans to exporters for the import and procurement of raw materials for production in export-oriented industries.

The Export Development Fund was established in Bangladesh in 1989 to facilitate access to financing in foreign exchange for input procurements by manufacturer-exporters.

Authorised dealers of banks can borrow US dollar funds from the EDF against their foreign currency loans to manufacturer-exporters for input procurements, the latest circular said.

Over the years, the EDF has played a key role in providing much-needed financing to the country’s export-oriented industries, particularly in sectors such as textiles, leather and pharmaceuticals.

On April 9, the central bank reduced ceiling on the US dollar loans from its EDF to manufacturers and exporters by $5 million with the aim of lowering pressure on reserves.

According to the circular, the ceiling has been reset to $10 million from $15 million for input procurements under back-to-back letters of credit (BBLCs) against relevant export orders.

The central bank on March 19 imposed penal interest of 4 per cent on delayed payments of loans received from the EDF so that such due amount can be realised soon.

The BB made the decision as it observed that EDF loans were not being realised in accordance with the instructions stated in a circular issued on December 31, 2017.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201924/edf-cut-to-477-billion,2023-05-18 10:36:49,newagebd
950,Dhaka stocks gain for 2nd day,"A file photo shows investors monitoring share price movements on computer screens at a brokerage house in the capital Dhaka. — New Age photo

Dhaka stocks gained for the second day on Wednesday, but the turnover decreased as most of the investors remained on the sideline amid economic worries in the country, market operators said.

They said that the market managed to end Wednesday’s session in the green zone as a section of investors went for investing in selective shares in late trading.

The turnover on the bourse decreased to Tk 711.98 crore on Wednesday compared with that of Tk 744.29 crore on Tuesday.

DSEX, the key index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, gained 4.04 points, or 0.06 per cent, and settled at 6,281.24 points on Wednesday after gaining 17.10 points on Tuesday.

However, the DS30 index decreased by 0.04 points to finish at 2,193.32 points and the DSE Shariah index also dropped by 0.50 points to close at 1,368.01 points on the day.

Share prices of more than two-thirds of the companies remained stuck in their floor prices.

The floor price restriction system, which the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission introduced in July 2022 to prevent any excessive plunges on the market, narrowed the access and exit options for investors and as a result, a big amount of the investors’ investments was stuck in the market, the market operators said.

Multiple challenges, including inflation, rising external debts, foreign exchange market volatility, depleted foreign exchange reserves, a growing trade deficit and energy crisis have forced most of the investors to remain on the sideline in recent months, they said.

Some investors kept trading cautiously ahead of the announcement of the national budget for the forthcoming financial year of 2023-24.

Finance minister AHM Mustafa Kamal will present the national budget in Jatiya Sangsad on June 1.

EBL Securities in its daily market commentary said that the benchmark index of the Dhaka bourse managed to stay in the green territory for the second consecutive session owing to investors’ continued chase for sector-specific issues with anticipation of quick gains.

The market witnessed some volatility during the early hours of Wednesday›s session as cautious investors opted for profit-booking in selective scrips amid uncertainty regarding the market momentum, it said.

On the sectoral front, general insurance issues exerted the highest turnover, followed by life insurance and IT stocks.

Most of the sectors displayed positive returns, out of which general insurance, travel and life insurance exhibited the most returns on the bourse on the day.

Services, jute and cement exerted the most corrections on the day.

Out of the 360 issues traded, 105 advanced, 66 declined and 189 remained unchanged on Wednesday.

Chartered Life Insurance, Al-Haj Textile, Meghna Insurance, Islami Commercial Insurance, Islami Insurance, Trust Islami Life Insurance, Far Chemical Industries, Express Insurance, Paper Processing and Global Insurance were the top 10 gainers considering their closing prices on the day.

National Tea Company, GBB Power, Khan Brothers PP, Bangladesh Welding Electrodes, MJL Bangladesh, Far East Knitting, Export Import (Exim) Bank, Sonali Aansh, Shyampur Sugar and National Feed Mill were the top 10 losers considering their closing prices on the day.

Bangladesh Shipping Corporation topped the turnover chart with its shares worth Tk 36.68 crore changing hands.

Intraco Refueling Station, Sea Pearl Beach Resort, Rupali Life Insurance, Agni Systems, Paramount Textile, Unique Hotel, Gemini Sea Food, Eastern Housing and Chartered Life Insurance were the other turnover leaders on the day.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201922/dhaka-stocks-gain-for-2nd-day,2023-05-18 10:36:50,newagebd

952,Nagad Finance gets NBFI licence,"The Bangladesh Bank on Wednesday issued licence to Nagad Finance PLC, allowing it to operate as a non-bank financial institution in the country.

The BB issued a circular in this regard on Wednesday where it said that the central bank provided the NBFI licence to Nagad Finance under the authority of section 4(1) of Financial Institution Act, 1993.

With the addition of Nagad Finance, the total number of NBFIs in the country now stands at 36.

Earlier on August 30, 2022, board of the Bangladesh Bank decided to provide letter of intent to Nagad, a mobile financial service provider of Bangladesh Post Office, granting it a licence as NBFI.

This licence allows Nagad to establish a subsidiary to formalise its mobile financial services (MFS) operations.

According to regulations, an MFS company has to be a subsidiary of another financial institution or government entity, similar to bKash, which is a subsidiary of BRAC Bank Limited.

By forming the subsidiary, Nagad will obtain a full licence from the Bangladesh Bank for its MFS operations.

After the formation of the subsidiary, Nagad will no longer be a government service – it will be like other private MFS providers.

Since 2019, Nagad has been operating under a temporary MFS licence through a service agreement with the Bangladesh Post Office.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201921/nagad-finance-gets-nbfi-licence,2023-05-18 10:36:52,newagebd
953,"Dollar jumps, global stocks advance","Most stock markets and the dollar rose on Wednesday as investors track talks aimed at breaking an impasse over raising the US debt ceiling.

All eyes remain on Washington, where lawmakers remain deadlocked in negotiations to lift the country’s borrowing limit to pay its debts and avert a market-rattling default.

The euro slid to $1.0814, the lowest level since early April, in a broad dollar rally as the greenback benefitted from its status as a safe bet in times of economic turmoil.

‘The greenback is finding support as lawmakers in Washington seem unable to reach an agreement over the lifting of the debt ceiling,’ said ActivTrades analyst Ricardo Evangelista.

‘The standoff between Democrats and Republicans is likely to continue and, if unresolved, could have serious consequences for the US and global economy.’

US president Joe Biden met Republican house speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday after saying staff-level talks had produced no shift.

McCarthy told reporters there was still ‘a lot of work to do’ before the country runs out of cash, which the Treasury has warned will happen around June 1.

There was a sliver of light, as he said he ultimately expected a deal.

And the White House said Biden was ‘optimistic that there is a path to a responsible, bipartisan budget agreement if both sides negotiate in good faith’.

In a bid to get an agreement over the line, the president — who flies to Japan on Wednesday for a G7 summit — scrapped subsequent stops in Papua New Guinea and Australia, instead planning to return to Washington on Sunday.

Despite the lack of concrete progress in the talks, equity investors seemed mollified by the statements and Wall Street’s main stock indices rose at the open.

European shares were also mostly higher in afternoon trading.

Despite the lack of a debt deal, ‘the spin coming out of that meeting is that it was a positive meeting, that a bipartisan deal can still get done to prevent a default’, said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O’Hare.

O’Hare said it was a ‘guarded trade’, however, as any deal would have to then be followed by a vote in Congress.

Asia indices enjoyed mixed fortunes but star performer Tokyo jumped after figures showed Japan’s economy grew more than expected in January-March thanks to a surge in tourism after pandemic border restrictions were lifted.

956,US top remittance sender in July-Apr with $3b,"A file photo shows a man counting dollar notes in the capital Dhaka. — New Age photo

Remittance inflow from the United States crossed $3 billion in the July-April period of the current financial year 2022-23, making the country the largest sender of remittances to Bangladesh in the period.

According to a Bangladesh Bank report, remittances from the US reached $3,047 million in July-April of FY23 against $2,870 million in the same period of FY22.

Remittances from the US accounted for 17.2 per cent of the total remittance inflow of Bangladesh.

After holding the top position as the leading remittance-sending country to Bangladesh for a considerable time, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ranked second, contributing 17.15 per cent or $3,039 million in remittances in the July-April period of FY23.

Remittances from the KSA was $3,862 million in July-April of FY22.

Gulf Cooperation Council countries (the KSA, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain) had 51.01 per cent share of the total inflow of remittances in July-April of FY23.

Remittances from the UAE were $2,408 million, from the United Kingdom $1,639 million, from Kuwait $1,322 million, from Qatar $1,215 million, from Italy $992 million and from Malaysia $923 million in the reporting period.

Bangladesh received total $17,718 million in July-April in FY23, up $410.26 million or 2.37 per cent on the same period of FY22.

The remittance-export earnings ratio and remittance-import payment ratio were 40.78 per cent and 29.73 per cent respectively in July-March period in FY23.

Bangladesh’s economy relies heavily on its expatriate earnings, which are the second-biggest source of foreign currency earnings, said the BB report.

The fiscal incentives and domestic monetary supportive policies by the government and Bangladesh Bank also play a role in returning the remittance inflows to a positive trend, it said.

However, experts observed that the growth was minimal considering a substantial increase in the number of migrants from Bangladesh in recent months.

About 3,23,010 Bangladeshi workers went abroad in January-March 2023, where two-thirds were unskilled, according to Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training data.

Based on occupation and skills, expatriates are categorised into four groups: professionals, skilled, semi-skilled and un-skilled.

The highest 73.57 per cent of expatriates were un-skilled in 2021 followed by skilled 20.66 per cent, semi-skilled 3.15 per cent and professional 0.13 per cent.

About 4.54 lack Bangladeshi expatriates were unskilled in 2021.

The poor growth of remittance could not address the high demand for dollar currency, which eventually depleted the foreign reserves of the country as the Bangladesh Bank continued with intervention in the foreign exchange market with net sales of $11.73 billion up to April of FY23.

The country’s foreign exchange reserve dropped to $29.8 billion on May 8 after the payment of import bills worth $1.18 billion was made to the Asian Clearing Union for March and April.

The interbank (excluding BB selling rate) exchange rate of the Bangladesh currency taka depreciated by 12.66 per cent at the end of April 2023 over that of the end June 2022.

The real effective exchange rate index increased from 101.83 in February 2023 to 102.08 in March 2023 as the local currency depreciated more compared with the currencies of major trading partner countries.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201835/us-top-remittance-sender-in-july-apr-with-3b,2023-05-18 10:36:56,newagebd

Local and global fabric makers and technology providers see a bright future of the Bangladesh denim sector as it provides quality products at reasonable prices with on-time delivery.

Although the apparel business is now facing a gloomy situation due to high inflation in the European Union countries and the United States, hopefully the business in Bangladesh would rebound within a few months thanks to growing confidence of global buyers, they said.

Global fashion brands are increasing their purchasing from Bangladesh and most of the denim fabric makers in the country are adopting new technologies to gain more global orders, Tanvir Hossain, project manager of Jeanologia, a technology supplying company, said.

Jeanologia, a Spain-based company, is taking part in the two-day Bangladesh Denim Expo which started at the International Convention City Bashundhara in Dhaka on Tuesday.

Tanvir said that almost all the denim manufacturers in Bangladesh adopted new technologies to reduce consumption of water in producing jeans as per the requirements of buyers.

He said that business was now going slow due to global economic instabilities, but his company was doing business in Bangladesh for the past 25 years with satisfactory growth.

Tanvir also said that the adoption of technologies was growing in Bangladesh, which meant the business was growing.

Adoption of technology has brought down the use of water to 9-30 litres from 360 litres to produce a pair of jeans and local manufacturers adopted it only due to fulfil the requirements from buyers, he added.

‘We are doing business in Bangladesh for the past 15 years and our sales are growing by 30-40 per cent year-on-year,’ Brant Tong, sales manager of XDD Textile from Vietnam, said.

He said that business was slow now because of inflation, but it might rebound after six months.

Brant said that Bangladesh was a big market for his company and XDD Textile sold 7 lakh yards of denim fabric here in every month.

He said that Bangladesh became the prime destination for the global apparel buyers and business had been increasing gradually.

Syed Mohammad Tahmir, director of Pacific Jeans, said that they were getting increased orders with fulfilling the sustainability requirements of buyers, but prices of products were not rising proportionately.

Mostafiz Uddin, chief executive officer of the Bangladesh Denim Expo, said that the denim show was acting as a lightning rod on the burning issues of the denim industry, bringing together all the denim stakeholders from across the world under the roof of the expo.

A total of 90 exhibitors from home and abroad are showcasing their latest denim products, fabrics, accessories, chemicals and technologies in the show.

On the first day of the 14th edition of the expo with the theme ‘Leading the way in denim innovation’, two panel discussions were held.

Speakers at the discussion said that innovation would be the key to ensuring the growth of Bangladesh’s denim export in the coming years.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201836/prospects-for-denim-sector-bright-say-fabric-makers,2023-05-18 10:36:59,newagebd

Law, justice, and parliamentary affairs minister Anisul Huq on Tuesday said that there was no ambiguity about the intention of the present government to ameliorate labour sector as per the international standard.

‘Amendment of law is a complex process, particularly the labour law, which happens in a tripartite setup and therefore it needs time. We are trying our best... I am aware that the Labour Law Working Group has been working vigorously to ensure that the labour act is amended within the reasonable time,’ he said.

The law minister said these while addressing the inaugural function of 'Tripartite Discussion on Technical Note and Global Good Practice to Align Bangladesh Labour Laws with Selected International Labour Standards' at hotel The Westin, an official release said.

Anisul called upon the tripartite labour law working group to be mindful of the law to be gender-responsive and non-discriminatory.

State minister for labour and employment Begum Munnujan Sufian, labour and employment secretary Ehsan-e-Elahi and ILO country director Tuomo Poutiainen addressed the function as special guests.

‘An updated labour law will not only address the comments of the committee of experts as discussed here today, but will address other modern day challenges and possibilities, and make the labour law more robust, fair, inclusive as well as business friendly,’ Anisul Huq further said.

He congratulated the Ministry of Labour and Employment for collaborating with the ILO to organise the tripartite discussion on the technical note and global good practice, adding, ‘It reflects the government's commitment towards implementing the action points mentioned in the roadmap and national action plan on the labour sector.’

Small location devices intended as a way for people to find backpacks, laptops, keys, handbags or other items have been used by stalkers to secretly track people such as ex-romantic partners.

‘Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits, but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking, which requires industry-wide action to solve,’ Google vice president of Android engineering Dave Burke said in a joint release.

A proposal Apple and Google submitted to a leading internet standards development organization would make Bluetooth tracking devices compatible with detection and alert systems in iOS and Android mobile software.

If adopted as a standard, Bluetooth tracking device makers would have the option of building the capabilities into their products.

‘This new industry specification builds upon the AirTag protections, and through collaboration with Google results in a critical step forward to help combat unwanted tracking across iOS and Android,’ Apple vice president of sensing and connectivity Ron Huang said in the release.

Conceived as an aid for the absent-minded, AirTag sensors have been diverted towards more sinister ends, with manufacturer Apple facing anger -- and lawsuits -- over their use as a stalking tool.

The silver and white gadget the size of a large coin is ‘an easy way to keep track of your stuff,’ the Apple website boasts. Customers can attach it to their keys, a wallet or a backpack.

When linked to a smartphone app, a $29 AirTag helps users detect their belongings’ real-time location in case they get lost -- but the transmitter can also trail the humans carrying those items.

Unwanted surveillance is a common tactic of abuse, according to Erica Olsen, senior director of the Safety Net Project at the National Network to End Domestic Violence.

‘It’s imperative for advocates and technology companies to work together on solutions to minimize the opportunities for misuse,’ Olsen said of Bluetooth trackers.

Center for Democracy and Technology chief executive Alexandra Reeve Givens commended Apple and Google for collaborating on a way to improve detection of unwanted tracking devices.

‘We look forward to the specification moving through the standardization process,’ Reeve Givens said.",2015-07-20 00:00:00,https://www.newagebd.net/article/200715/apple-google-aim-to-expose-bluetooth-tracker-abuse,2023-05-18 10:37:00,newagebd
962,ChatGPT eating into businesses of online learning giants,"This picture taken on April 26, 2023 in Toulouse, southwestern France, shows a screen displaying the logo of ChatGPT, the conversational artificial intelligence software application developed by OpenAI. – AFP photo.

Shares in companies that specialize in publishing school textbooks and offering online classes took a big hit on Tuesday after signs emerged that AI-bots such as ChatGPT were eating into their business.

Silicon Valley-based Chegg is an education tech company that provides online homework help and textbooks, and on Monday its CEO admitted that the explosion of generative AI chatbots had hurt revenue.

‘In the first part of the year, we saw no noticeable impact from ChatGPT on our new account growth and we were meeting expectations on new sign-ups,’ Chegg CEO Dan Rosensweig told analysts on Monday.

‘However, since March we saw a significant spike in student interest in ChatGPT. We now believe it’s having an impact on our new customer growth rate,’ he added.

Specifically, the 18-year-old company reported a sales drop of seven percent over one year as well as a five per cent fall in subscribers.

The admission sent shockwaves through the ed tech sector pushing Chegg’s share price down by almost 50 percent and hammering similar companies such as UK-based Pearson, that lost 15 percent in London.

The chief executive insisted that the students’ pivot to ChatGPT was a blip and that clients who kept their faith in the company’s products ‘continue to choose us and retain us at high rates.’

He also said that it launched its own AI-powered tool called CheggMate, that was tailored to students and based on GPT-4, the latest iteration of the technology created by Microsoft-backed OpenAI and that powers ChatGPT.

Chegg has in the past faced the same accusations addressed to ChatGPT of providing students with readymade ways to cheat, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic when test-taking was largely taking place online outside a teacher’s supervision.

While ChatGPT-style AI has largely been seen as a boon for the economy, the implosion in education tech stocks was the clearest example yet of the technology’s capabilities assailing a company’s bottom line.

Given the technology’s untested nature, experts believe that the companies most vulnerable to AI for now are businesses that require little specialization - such as call centers or tutoring services as offered by Chegg and others.

For the time being, ‘you’re only going to see very specific kinds of tasks that people are willing to farm out to generative AI,’ said Vishal Gupta, an associate professor at the USC Marshall School of Business.

These tasks are going to be ‘lower stakes’ given the uncertainties about the technology, he added.",2007-07-20 00:00:00,https://www.newagebd.net/article/200707/chatgpt-eating-into-businesses-of-online-learning-giants,2023-05-18 10:37:01,newagebd

964,"Google stops work on big Silicon Valley campus, says report","Google has paused construction of a massive campus in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose as it reins in costs, CNBC reported Friday.

Google's parent company Alphabet early this year announced it would cut about 12,000 jobs globally, citing a challenging economic reality.

Alphabet reported lower revenue and profit than expected in the final three months of last year as harsh economic times cooled its ad business.

The internet titan is scheduled to release its most recent quarterly earnings figures next week.

A site in San Jose had been cleared for a Google ""Downtown West"" campus, with construction to start by the end of this year, according to CNBC.

The report cited unnamed people as saying the project was put on pause, with no word sent to contractors regarding when it might resume.

An approved plan for the 80-acre (32 hectare) campus included office space, housing units, and public parks, according to CNBC.

Alphabet's budget cuts follow a major hiring spree during the height of the coronavirus pandemic by internet companies scrambling to meet demand as people went online for work, school and entertainment.

Analysts have said tech's big guns had previously overspent, not seeing a slowdown on the horizon.

Google's world-dominating search engine has found itself under pressure with the emergence of ChatGPT, a Microsoft-backed chatbot that can generate elaborate, human-like content in just seconds.

Microsoft is using technology to strengthen Bing, a longtime rival to Google search.

Google recently began letting people in the United States and Britain test its AI chatbot, known as Bard, as it continues on its gradual path to catch up with Microsoft-backed ChatGPT.

Bard, ChatGPT and other similar artificial intelligence apps churn out essays, poems or computing code on command and have taken the world by storm as the biggest new thing in tech since the advent of the iPhone.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/199982/google-stops-work-on-big-silicon-valley-campus-says-report,2023-05-18 10:37:03,newagebd

Twitter has dropped ‘state-affiliated’ and ‘government-funded’ labels from media accounts, according to a review by AFP on April 21, 2023 of many high-profile pages on the platform. – AFP photo

Twitter has dropped ‘state-affiliated’ and ‘government-funded’ labels from media accounts after widespread complaints, according to a review Friday of many high-profile pages.

As Elon Musk’s platform rolls out a series of changes, it has also reportedly told businesses they must pay for blue verification ticks or ‘verified organization’ checkmarks if they want to advertise on Twitter.

Advertisers spending at least $1,000 monthly will be spared from paying, according to a notice shared on Twitter, which is seeking to increase revenue.

Getting advertisers to pay subscriptions is part of a strategy ‘to elevate the quality of the content on Twitter and enhance your experience,’ read the message to advertisers.

Musk’s long-promised move to strip free blue ticks from many Twitter users swung into action on Thursday.

Blue ticks were once a coveted symbol of authenticity, but can now be bought for $8 a month.

‘(Musk) has absolutely made the blue tick a badge of shame,’ read a tweet from the account of @vanbadham. ‘I see anyone with one and my judgement is instant and damning.’

Musk’s tumultuous ownership of Twitter has seen staffing slashed and advertisers fleeing the platform.

Users complain that hate speech and misinformation have proliferated, and accounts with extreme views are gaining traction due to less content moderation.

Twitter, acquired by the mercurial billionaire last year, had long labeled accounts linked to state media or government officials, especially from China and Russia.

But recently the labels were applied to news organizations that received public funding but were not controlled by any governments.

National Public Radio in the United States stopped using Twitter, and Canada’s CBC followed suit.

On Friday many major media outlets from Western nations, Russia, China and other countries that had been tagged ‘state-affiliated’ and ‘government-funded’ no longer displayed the labels.

They included the accounts of NPR, China’s official Xinhua news agency, RT from Russia and CBC.

Musk has expressed disdain for news media for years and recently installed an automatic response of a poop emoji to emailed inquiries from journalists.

News organizations have struggled to wean themselves from Twitter, which remains a key communication exchange for celebrities, politicians and pundits.

Musk, whose chaotic takeover of Twitter has seen his $44 billion investment shrivel, earlier pledged to get rid of what he described as a ‘lords & peasants system,’ in which journalists, celebrities and politicians were given the blue tick that verified their account.

Only a tiny fraction of those who had free, verified accounts have switched to paying subscriptions, a programmer who tracks the platform tweeted on Friday.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/199986/twitter-drops-labels-from-media-accounts-in-latest-changes,2023-05-18 10:37:04,newagebd
966,Jack Ma accepts university teaching post in Hong Kong,"Jack Ma. — AFP file photo

Jack Ma, founder of Chinese tech giant Alibaba, has been made an honorary professor of business at a top university in Hong Kong, the school announced on Friday.

The appointment comes weeks after the billionaire made a rare public appearance in China following his fall from grace during a government crackdown on the tech industry over two years ago.

Ma has kept a low profile since late 2020, when a speech he made attacking Chinese regulators was followed by Beijing pulling the plug on a planned IPO by Alibaba affiliate Ant Group.

A record fine of $2.75 billion was later imposed on Alibaba for alleged unfair business practices.

The University of Hong Kong on Friday said Ma had accepted an honorary professorship from its business school.

A spokesperson for the institution said it welcomed Ma sharing ‘his rich knowledge and experience in business innovation and development’.

The professorship carries a three-year term ending in March 2026, according to local media.

The school’s website now contains a profile of Ma highlighting his expertise in ‘management and strategy’.

In 2018 the same university awarded Ma an honorary doctorate.

However, Ma has ‘no plans for public lectures or speeches’, according to the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper wholly owned by Alibaba.

The Jack Ma Foundation, a charitable organisation set up by the billionaire in 2014, told the Post that ‘after a hiatus from the world of education, Mr Ma looks forward to returning to campus life’.

Ma previously taught English for eight years at Hangzhou Dianzi University in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang before he launched Alibaba.

He also founded in 2015 a centre for entrepreneurship in Zhejiang along with several Chinese business heavyweights.

That institution was originally called Hupan University but had the term ‘university’ removed from its name in 2021 amid Ma’s spat with Chinese authorities.

Ma has been spotted in a number of locations around the world over the past two years, including on the Spanish island of Mallorca, and was reportedly living in Japan for much of 2022.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/199967/jack-ma-accepts-university-teaching-post-in-hong-kong,2023-05-18 10:37:05,newagebd

And so The Great Sorting has begun. Elon Musk’s long promised move to strip un-paid-for Blue Ticks from Twitter users swung into action on April 20, 2023. – AFP photo.

Twitter began the mass removal of its blue ticks on Thursday, as the symbol previously used to signify a verified account vanished from users including the Pope, Donald Trump and Justin Bieber.

Owner Elon Musk, who has seen his $44 billion investment in the site shrivel, earlier pledged to get rid of what he described as a ‘lords & peasants system.’

He offered instead to sell the blue badge to anyone who would pay $8 a month, in a move he said last year would ‘democratize journalism & empower the voice of the people.’

Earlier dates set for the rollback of the ticks -- predominately used by celebrities, journalists and politicians -- have slipped by without noticeable action.

But on Thursday high-profile accounts, as well as those of many reporters at AFP and other news organizations, appeared to have had the checkmarks removed.

Politicians and official bodies also appeared to have been hit, with US Senator Brian Schatz objecting to the possible effect on public confidence in the event of disasters.

‘There really ought to be a way for emergency managers to verify that they are real on this website or imposters will cause suffering and death,’ he tweeted.

‘I am not complaining about my own check mark, I just think during natural disasters it’s essential to know that FEMA is actually FEMA,’ he wrote, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency that steps in after hurricanes and deadly storms.

Thursday’s removals follow spats between Twitter and various news organizations that have objected to labels appended to their accounts indicating they were ‘state affiliated’ or ‘government funded.’

Sweden’s public radio Sveriges Radio said this week it would stop tweeting, following in the footsteps of US radio station NPR and Canadian broadcaster CBC.

Musk’s tumultuous ownership of Twitter has seen thousands of staff made redundant and advertisers fleeing the platform.

Users complain that hate speech and misinformation has proliferated and accounts with extreme views are gaining traction due to less content moderation.

This month, a closely watched forecast said Twitter’s income from advertising will fall by a large margin in 2023.

Analysts at Insider Intelligence said they were slashing an earlier worldwide revenue estimate of $4.74 billion by more than a third to $2.98 billion as trust deteriorates.

According to research firm Pathmatics, 14 of the top 30 advertisers on Twitter stopped advertising on the platform since Musk took charge on October 27.

Insider Intelligence noted that Musk’s efforts to build up a subscription service ‘won’t make up for the lost ad revenue.’",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/199949/twitter-begins-mass-removal-of-its-blue-ticks,2023-05-18 10:37:06,newagebd

Canada’s public broadcaster CBC and its French-language version Radio-Canada said April 17, 2023 they were effectively quitting Twitter over a new government-funded label it says questions its editorial independence. -- AFP

Canada’s public broadcaster CBC and its French-language version Radio-Canada said on Monday that they were effectively quitting Twitter over a new ‘government-funded’ label it says questions its editorial independence.

The exit follows that of National Public Radio in the United States over the same tag, which had also been applied to the BBC before the British broadcaster successfully petitioned to have it changed to ‘publicly-funded.’

In a statement, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/Radio-Canada said Twitter had added a ‘government-funded media’ label to its account, branding it the same way as it does major media outlets in authoritarian countries such as Russia or China.

‘In the case of CBC/Radio-Canada this labeling is untrue and deceptive,’ the statement said.

While the broadcaster is publicly funded, it said its editorial independence is protected under Canadian broadcasting law.

‘Twitter can be a powerful tool for our journalists to communicate with Canadians, but it undermines the accuracy and professionalism of the work they do to allow our independence to be falsely described in this way,’ it said.

‘Consequently, we will be pausing our activity on our corporate Twitter account and all CBC and Radio-Canada news-related accounts.’

The broadcaster instead urged Canadians to follow it on other social media.

Conservative opposition leader Pierre Poilievre, who has publicly expressed disdain for the CBC and fundraised on promises to gut its funding, last week wrote to Elon Musk urging him to add a ‘government-funded media’ label to CBC’s Twitter accounts.

He said such was ‘in the interest of transparency’ and noted that almost two-thirds of its funding in fiscal 2021-2022 was from the federal government.

On Monday, Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau blasted his rival for ‘attacking this Canadian institution, and attacking the culture and local content (that it produces) that is so important to so many Canadians.’

Since Elon Musk bought Twitter, the company has relaxed its moderation of content on the network, letting back many users banned because of messages inciting hatred or spreading misinformation.

Musk also slashed Twitter’s workforce from 7,500 to fewer than 2,000 employees.

He has expressed deep disdain for news media for years and recently installed an automatic response of a poop emoji to emailed inquiries from journalists.

973,I want to spread Radharaman at grassroots level: Biswajit,"Biswajit Roy

Senior folk singer, researcher and organiser Biswajit Roy has said that he aspires to spread folk bard Radharaman Dutta’s songs at the grassroots level.

Biswajit Roy has been researching on Radharaman Dutt for a long time.

He urges people from all walks of life and the government to come forward and play a role in preserving the work of Radharaman.

‘The songs of Radharaman Dutt occupy an important position in Bangla folk music. It is important to preserve his work and promote them among the younger generation,’ Biswajit Roy told New Age.

Biswajit Roy grew up listening to songs of Radharaman from his mother. He gradually developed a liking for the works of Radharaman Dutt and started collecting and singing the songs.

‘After coming to Dhaka from my village, I started learning Nazrul song from Ustad Sohrab Hossain at Chhayanaut. I have been deeply influenced by Nazrul songs during my journey,’ said Biswajit Roy.

He founded Radharaman Sangskriti Charcha Kendra in 2011 intending to collect and preserve the works of Radharaman and spread his works among people.

‘I want to spread Radharaman’s works at the grassroots level. Therefore, I founded Radharaman Sangskriti Charcha Kendra in 2011. In the same year, we also organised Radharaman Sangeet Utsab under the banner of the organisation,’ said Biswajit Roy.

‘The scale of the annual music festival gradually grew over the years. Therefore, we renamed the festival as Radharaman Lok Sangeet Utsab in 2021,’ he added.

‘The Radharaman Sangskriti Charcha Kendra has been collecting and preserving Radharaman’s works, publishing books of his unpublished works, organising workshops and others,’ mentioned Biswajit Roy, who did his PhD on the songs of Radharaman and their poetic values in 2018.

He also founded a cultural organisation named Nibedon to promote and spread classical music in 1991 and founded Bangladesh Sangeet Sangathan Samannay Parishad, an umbrella organisation of music-based organisations, in 2007.

Bangladesh Sangeet Sangathan Samannay Parishad has 33 branches across the country.

Biswajit Roy said that steps should be taken to introduce the younger generation to folk music.

‘The younger generation has a lot of interest in folk music. However, fusion music is being promoted among the youth in the name of folk music. Therefore, they are remaining oblivious to authentic folk songs. Steps should be taken to promote folk songs among the younger generation so that they can explore their roots,’ said Biswajit Roy.

Biswajit Roy also said, ‘The government needs to do more to ensure the preservation and development of folk music. Therefore, the government should form a separate cell for folk music. It will work for preservation, promoting and development of folk music.’

‘The authorities concerned should also monitor the music that is being aired on different channels in the name of folk songs,’ ended Biswajit Roy.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201933/i-want-to-spread-radharaman-at-grassroots-level-biswajit,2023-05-18 10:37:11,newagebd

Johnny Depp was feted by fans on Tuesday as he arrived on the red carpet for the screening of his comeback film at the opening of the Cannes Film Festival, which has sparked anger over the choice to celebrate the divisive megastar.

Depp, 59, sporting a ponytail and shades, spent several minutes schmoozing with screaming fans, posing for selfies and signing autographs, before the screening of French period drama ‘Jeanne du Barry’, in which he plays King Louis XV.

He joined stars such as Uma Thurman, Helen Mirren -- her hair a witchy stack of blue and velvet -- and Elle Fanning, for the first night of the industry shindig on the French Riviera.

Michael Douglas also received an honorary Palme d’Or, with the 78-year-old joking about the fact he is two years older than the festival.

‘This means so much to me because there are hundreds of festivals around the world but there’s only one Cannes,’ he said.

While 21 films from around the globe are competing for the Palme d’Or -- the festival’s top prize -- there have repeated questions over its choice of opening film.

Depp remains a controversial figure since toxic court battles with ex-wife Amber Heard that revealed a turbulent private life involving alcohol, drugs and domestic abuse allegations.

But he is a long way from being ‘cancelled’, securing a record $20 million deal to remain the face of Dior fragrance, according to Variety last week, and set to direct Al Pacino in a biopic of artist Amedeo Modigliani later this year.

Although his new film is playing out of competition, the jury for the Palme d’Or was asked about Depp’s presence.

Jury member Brie Larson, star of ‘Captain Marvel’ and an outspoken MeToo supporter, looked flustered.

‘You are asking me that? I don’t understand... Why me specifically?’ she said.

‘I don’t know how I feel about it,’ she added, curtly.

But there was plenty of anger online, with a friend of Heard, journalist Eve Barlow, starting a new hashtag -- #CannesYouNot -- criticising the decision to invite Depp.

‘Cannes seem proud of their history supporting rapists and abusers,’ Barlow wrote on Instagram, with pictures of Depp alongside past Cannes regulars such as Harvey Weinstein, Roman Polanski and Gerard Depardieu -- all of whom have faced sexual assault allegations.

On Monday, festival director Thierry Fremaux said he was not interested in Depp’s legal woes, saying: ‘I am interested in Depp the actor.’

A group of 123 French film industry workers also denounced the festival for ‘rolling out the red carpet to men and women who commit assaults.’

Jury chief Ruben Ostlund, who won the top prize last year, described the Palme as ‘the greatest film prize in the world. If I can choose between an Oscar and a Palme, it is an easy choice.’

Of the films in the running for the award, a record seven have been directed by women.

Several Palme laureates are back in competition, including Britain’s two-time winner Ken Loach, Japan’s Hirokazu Kore-eda and Germany’s Wim Wenders.

The festival, which runs until May 27, includes a slew of hot-ticket premieres, including ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’, the fifth and final outing for Harrison Ford as the whip-cracking archaeologist, and Martin Scorsese’s new epic, ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro.

Around a thousand police and security guards are in place for the festival, amid fears of protests linked to President Emmanuel Macron’s unpopular pension reforms, with the CGT union even threatening to cut power.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201901/johnny-depp-starrer-opens-cannes,2023-05-18 10:37:12,newagebd

The Cannes Film Festival was preparing to roll out the red carpet on Monday for a star-packed edition featuring Harrison Ford, Johnny Depp and Natalie Portman -- but also concerns over protests by French unions.

Some 35,000 people are expected for the festival’s 76th edition, which kicks off Tuesday in the French Riviera town and runs to May 27.

Several big-name premieres are showing at the world’s biggest cinema industry shindig, including ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’, Martin Scorsese’s ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro and new Pixar film ‘Elemental’.

Meanwhile, 21 films are competing for the top prize Palme d’Or, including a record seven women directors.

Around a thousand police and security guards are in place for the festival, which has been held under a heightened security alert ever since a wave of terror attacks in France in the 2010s.

This year, organisers face additional worries that recent protests over President Emmanuel Macron’s pension reforms will affect the festival.

All protests are banned around the Croisette during the event, local authorities told AFP, adding that this was the same as previous years.

But the CGT union has vowed to make its presence felt -- threatening last month that it would cut power during the festival and announcing a ‘fixed’ protest in front of the famed Carlton Hotel on Friday.

The famous red carpet, 60 metres (yards) long, will be unrolled on Tuesday. These days, in a nod to environmental concerns, its size has been cut in two to save some 1,400 kilos of carpet.

The jury is led by last year’s Palme d’Or winner, Ruben Ostlund, and also includes Hollywood stars Brie Larson and Paul Dano.

Several Palme laureates are back in competition, including Britain’s two-time winner Ken Loach, Japan’s Hirokazu Kore-eda and Germany’s Wim Wenders.

The opening film is bound to make waves: ‘Jeanne du Barry’ is billed as Johnny Depp’s comeback film, a period drama in which the controversial star tests out his French skills as King Louis XV.

Its director and lead actress is French star Maiwenn, an outspoken critic of the MeToo movement, who was last month accused of assaulting a journalist in a Paris restaurant.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201772/cannes-braces-for-stars-protests,2023-05-18 10:37:13,newagebd
976,Exhibition showcases thought-provoking cartoons by Nazrul,"Cartoons by Mohammad Nazrul Islam.

The late cartoonist Mohammad Nazrul Islam left an impression on people by drawing thought-provoking political cartoons depicting anomalies in society that were published in various newspapers and magazines between the 1970s and 1990s.

An exhibition displaying selected 40 political cartoons by Mohammad Nazrul held at the Zainul Gallery of fine arts faculty of Dhaka University gave the younger generation a glimpse into different issues, including deforestation, corrupt politicians, inflation, food adulteration, corruption, load shedding and violation of child rights.

The cartoons, created decades ago, shed light on problems that have been impeding Bangladesh’s progress since the country’s independence.

The displayed cartoons were collected from national and international newspapers and magazines, which were published from 1974 to 1998.

A series comprising four caricatures showed a man being strangled by inflation.

A cartoon, published in Bichitra in 1978, showed people eating a plane containing the logo of Biman Bangladesh Airlines.

A cartoon, published in Newsweek in August 1979, showed leaders of two foreign countries sitting at a table preparing to devour a white dove standing on a plate.

A cartoon, published in Unmad in 1993, showed leaders of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Awami League ignoring each other.

‘Mohammad Nazrul Islam was seriously injured on March 25, 1971 when the Pakistani occupation forces attacked the hostel of Arts College behind New Market, Dhaka. After he regained consciousness, he found himself lying in a pool of blood of his three dead roommates. The slum dwellers living nearby rescued him and hid him inside the slum. They took him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital in the morning on March 26, 1971,’ said his widow Rowsan Ara, who organised the exhibition.

‘He passionately raised his voice with his cartoons depicting political situations and issues of public interest. Although he was popular among the people, political activists and different organisations criticised him. He never preserved his works. After his death, we collected his published works and organised this exhibition,’ she added.

Mohammad Nazrul Islam died on May 27, 2020 at the age of 71. The exhibition, which began on May 10, ended on Tuesday.

The exhibition was inaugurated by cartoonist and professor at fine arts faculty of Dhaka University Shishir Bhattacharjee. Renowned cartoonist and Unmad editor Ahsan Habib and filmmaker Muhammad Quayum were present as special guests at the inaugural ceremony held on May 10.

977,Film industry mourns death of Farooque,"Akbar Hossain Pathan Farooque

Actor Akbar Hossain Pathan Farooque, who gained a huge fan following during the golden age of Bangladeshi films, passed away while undergoing treatment in Singapore on Monday. He was 74.

Film industry insiders expressed deep shock at the death of Farooque and recalled his contribution to the country’s film industry.

Farooque and Babita had great on-screen chemistry. Film directors were enthused over it and made films, including Alor Michhil, Lathial, Abar Tora Manush Ho, Ekhon Anek Raat, Sujan Sokhi, Golapi Ekhon Train-e, Sareng Bou and Nayanmoni.

The National Film Award-winning actor said, ‘We worked together in more than 30 to 40 films. After the War of Independence, I worked for the first time with Farooque in Narayan Ghosh Mita-directed film Alor Michhil. Following which, we acted in films, namely Lathial, Abar Tora Manush Ho, Ekhon Anek Raat, Sujan Sokhi, Golapi Ekhon Train-e, Sareng Bou and Nayanmoni.’

‘We made so many good memories. I would like to say that he not only had the ability to get into a character but he could also bring characters to life. The news of his death came as a great shock to me. His contribution to Bangla film can never be forgotten,’ added Farida Akhtar Babita.

Ekushey Padak-winning actor Dilara Zaman said, ‘He was a down-to-earth person with no pretensions. He was also a very friendly person. There will never be another artiste like him. His passing away has left a huge void in the country’s film industry. Today’s film actors should learn from him and follow in his footsteps.’

National Film Award-winning film director Kazi Hayat said, ‘I had a warm relationship with him. He was a good man. Although he had no presence in film for many years, he acted in a good number of timeless films, including Sareng Bou, Golapi Ekhon Train-e, Nayanmoni, Lathial and Alor Michhil. He will live through his works.’

National Film Award-winning actress Dolly Zahur said, ‘He was unwell for many years. When he used to walk in the Uttara Park, we walked together and talked about many topics, including politics and film. He will live through his works.’

National Film Award winning actor and president of Bangladesh Film Artistes Association Ilias Kanchan said, ‘We lost a legend. He was senior to me. I have been deeply saddened by the news of his death.’",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201770/film-industry-mourns-death-of-farooque,2023-05-18 10:37:15,newagebd
978,‘Lord of the Rings’ video game on cards,"US tech giant Amazon has announced it is developing an open-world style video game based on the classic ‘Lord of the Rings’ saga.

JRR Tolkien’s stories of mythical creatures struggling with the mystical power of the rings have become a staple on the video game scene -- most famously the tie-ins with Peter Jackson’s epic film trilogy in the early 2000s.

Amazon Games said on Monday it was working on a massively multiplayer online game (MMO), where players can roam around virtual worlds and create their own adventures.

The Jeff Bezos-owned behemoth has spent years carving out a space in the video game market with its own studio, a cloud gaming service called Luna and the gaming-focused streaming platform Twitch.

‘Bringing players a fresh take on The Lord of the Rings has long been an aspiration for our team,’ said Christoph Hartmann, vice president of Amazon Games.

He said Amazon was working with Embracer Group, a holding company that owns the rights to video game versions of Tolkien’s stories, to develop the game.

‘We’re taking every care to deliver an MMO which will do justice to the expansive Middle-earth universe and delight players around the world,’ said Lee Guinchard of Freemode, part of the Embracer Group.

Amazon did not confirm specifics of the game -- there is not yet a title or a release date.

Amazon’s TV offshoot, Amazon Prime Video, is also deeply invested in Tolkien’s world -- spending more than $1 billion on its adaption of the Lord of the Rings.

The US firm has already developed successful open-world games -- it launched ‘New World’ in 2021 to generally positive reviews.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201852/lord-of-the-rings-video-game-on-cards,2023-05-18 10:37:16,newagebd

Dozens of bawling Japanese babies faced off on Saturday in a traditional ‘crying sumo’ ritual believed to bring the infants good health, which returned for the first time in four years after the Covid pandemic.

Pairs of toddlers wearing ceremonial sumo aprons were held up by their parents and faced each other in the sumo ring at Sensoji Temple in Tokyo.

Staff wearing ‘oni’ demon masks tried to make the babies cry, with the first to bawl declared the winner by a sumo referee in an elaborate traditional uniform holding a wooden fan used to signal victory.

‘We can tell a baby’s health condition by listening to the way they cry. Today she may get nervous and not cry so much, but I want to hear her healthy crying,’ Hisae Watanabe, mother of an eight-month-old, said.

The ‘crying sumo’ is held at shrines and temples nationwide, to the delight of parents and onlookers.

Shigemi Fuji, chairman of Asakusa Tourism Federation which organised the event, said some people might think it’s terrible they make babies cry.

‘But in Japan, we believe babies who cry powerfully also grow up healthily. This kind of event takes place in many places in Japan,’ he said.

A total of 64 babies participated in the ritual, according to the organiser.

The rules vary from region to region -- in some places parents want their offspring to be the first to cry, in others the first to weep is the loser.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/199996/japans-crying-baby-sumo-festival-returns-after-covid-pandemic,2023-05-18 10:37:21,newagebd
985,Man arrested after bathing in rhino pen at New Zealand zoo,"Representational image.

A man was arrested at a New Zealand zoo on Wednesday after he broke into an enclosure and took a leisurely bath in a moat next to ‘startled’ rhinos and antelopes.

Social media footage of the incident in Auckland Zoo showed the man floating on his back, before washing his face and rinsing his hair.

The enclosure is home to rhinos and nyalas, a breed of spiral-horned antelope.

The animals ‘were understandably startled by the intruder’, an Auckland Zoo spokesperson said.

The man was said to be in the water ‘for a number of minutes’ before responding to instructions by zoo staff to get out of the moat and return to the visitor's path.

He was escorted off the premises and handed to the police.

Zoo director Kevin Buley said he was ‘very relieved’ that there were no injuries to the animals or visitors of the zoo as a result of the incident.

‘We hope that the man involved gets the help and support that he very clearly needs,’ he added.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/199979/man-arrested-after-bathing-in-rhino-pen-at-new-zealand-zoo,2023-05-18 10:37:22,newagebd

An Indian farmer whose extraordinary bond with a large bird made him a social media star has asked for his feathered friend to be set free after it was captured by wildlife authorities.

Mohammad Arif rescued the injured Sarus crane -- a crimson-necked wetlands species that can grow up to 1.8 metres (six feet) in height -- and nursed it back to health.

He set it free six weeks later, but the crane remained near his home in the city of Amethi, trailing the farmer when he went for bike rides and eating out of his hands.

‘The bird would stay with its family during the day and return in the evenings. Or in the afternoons when it was hungry it would come and wait at our door,’ Arif, 30, told AFP on Thursday.

Videos of the bird and his human guardian went viral on social media and Arif amassed nearly 300,000 Instagram followers by documenting their exploits.

Their remarkable friendship was rudely interrupted last month when authorities captured the crane and later brought it to a zoo in Kanpur, a city more than four hours’ drive away.

The crane is currently in a small quarantine cage, but Arif has asked for the bird -- which he refers to simply as ‘friend’ -- to be released.

Arif went to visit the crane on Tuesday and video of their emotional reunion was shared online, with footage showing the bird flapping its wings excitedly and jumping up and down.

‘The moment I reached the zoo, it recognised my voice,’ said Arif. ’It appeared quite distressed. Maybe it thought I will get him released from the prison.’

Media reports of the bird’s plight have led to an outpouring of sympathy from the Indian public, with nearly 4,000 people signing an online petition demanding the crane’s freedom.

‘The crane committed no crime. Is being friendly with human beings a crime?’ text accompanying the petition said.

The Sarus crane is the tallest flying bird in the world and is listed as ‘vulnerable’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Less than 20,000 of the species remain in India, according to the Worldwide Fund for Nature.

Arif said his friend should be released either into the forest or a bird sanctuary.

‘It has never lived in a cage before, it has always lived free,’ he said.

He was also confident the bird would return to his home.

‘The moment they release it, it will come back to me,’ he said.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/199434/indian-man-asks-zoo-for-release-of-feathered-friend,2023-05-18 10:37:23,newagebd

A Cambodian airplane fanatic has built his house shaped like a private jet — despite never having been up in the air himself.

Construction worker Chrach Peou spent his $20,000 life savings building the concrete ‘plane’ — complete with wings, tailfin, landing gear and engines — near the town of Siem Reap, gateway to the famed Angkor Wat temple complex.

The 43-year-old widowed father of three said it took him almost a year to build, using money he had saved over 30 years.

‘This is my dream since I was young, so I am happy I could achieve my goal,’ Peou said.

The house, which has two bedrooms and two bathrooms, stands elevated on pillars six metres above a rice field.

‘We can live here, sleep here, use bathrooms here, and have meals here like on a plane. It is my own, I am so happy,’ Peou said.

He said he designed the house after watching countless videos of private jets on the internet.

He charges people 50 cents to $1 to visit and take selfies by the house.

‘It is beautiful, attractive, there are palm trees nearby,’ Kim Muoy, 28, said during a visit to the airplane house with her family.

But Peou dreams of flying for real one day.

‘When I have money and know where I want to go to, I will take a plane to go there,’ he said.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/197700/cambodian-man-lands-airplane-house-on-rice-field,2023-05-18 10:37:24,newagebd

A celebrity gossip YouTuber-turned-lawmaker became the first MP expelled by Japan’s parliament in over 70 years on Wednesday, having not shown up to work once.

Yoshikazu Higashitani, known by his online moniker GaaSyy, had been ordered to apologise for his months-long absence earlier in March.

But the lawmaker, one of two elected members of the fringe party Seijika Joshi 48, or ‘Politician Girls 48’, did not attend that parliamentary session either.

Higashitani, 51, had not set foot in the House of Councillors since his July 2022 election, despite a requirement for lawmakers to be present.

The former businessman and YouTuber has instead remained at his home in Dubai, claiming he may be arrested if he returns to Japan, where he reportedly faces questioning over alleged defamation.

Japan’s Upper House decided on Tuesday to expel him from parliament.

The move was made official Wednesday -- making him the first Japanese lawmaker to be expelled since 1951, local media reported.

Higashitani will be replaced by another member of his party.

989,Flipping the bird a ‘God-given’ right: Canadian judge,"Giving your neighbor the finger, while maybe not polite, is protected as part of the bird-flipper’s right to freedom of expression under the Canadian Constitution, a judge ruled recently.

In a 26-page decision, Judge Dennis Galiatsatos of the French-speaking province of Quebec dismissed a case against a man accused of harassing his neighbor in a Montreal suburb.

‘To be abundantly clear, it is not a crime to give someone the finger,’ he said in a ruling dated February 24.

‘Flipping the proverbial bird is a God-given, Charter enshrined right that belongs to every red-blooded Canadian,’ he added, referring to Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The accused, Neall Epstein, a teacher and father of two, had been arrested by police in May 2021 for threatening and flipping off his neighbor in Beaconsfield, Quebec.

The gesture ‘may not be civil, it may not be polite, it may not be gentlemanly... Nevertheless, it does not trigger criminal liability,’ Galiatsatos ruled.

He added that despite common vernacular, ‘cases aren’t actually thrown out,’ but that in this matter ‘the Court is inclined to actually take the file and throw it out the window.’

‘Alas,’ Galiatsatos said, ‘the courtrooms of the Montreal courthouse do not have windows.’",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/196449/flipping-the-bird-a-god-given-right-canadian-judge,2023-05-18 10:37:25,newagebd
990,Spain court orders man to pay former wife for 25 years of housework,"Representational image.

A Spanish court ordered a man to pay his former wife 200,000 euros for 25 years of unpaid domestic labour, based on the minimum wage throughout their marriage, court documents showed on Tuesday.

The man was ordered to pay her ‘204,624.86 euros ($218,300), calculating the figure based on the annual minimum wage’ throughout their marriage, said the ruling by a court in the southern Andalusia region, a copy of which was seen by AFP.

The couple had two daughters, with their marriage governed by a separation of property regime, which specified that whatever each party earned was theirs alone, which in this case would have left the wife with no access to any of the wealth acquired through years of partnership.

Since marrying, the wife had dedicated herself ‘to essentially working in the home, which meant looking after the home and the family and all that involves,’ the ruling said.

Legal papers showed a breakdown of what she would have earned annually for the years between June 1995 and December 2020.

The ex-husband was also ordered to pay her a monthly childcare allowance for the daughters, one of whom is a minor while the other is over 18.

Speaking to Cadena Ser radio, the woman, who was not named, said her husband did not ‘want her to work’ outside the home although he let her work at the gyms he owned, where she handled ‘public relations and acted as a monitor’.

Apart from that, ‘I have dedicated myself exclusively to housework, looking after my husband and the house,’ she said.

‘He made me take on the specific role’ of doing domestic chores, to the extent that ‘I was in a place where I couldn’t really do much else,’ she said.

The sentence had made her ‘very happy’ because it was ‘very well deserved’, she said.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/196345/spain-court-orders-man-to-pay-former-wife-for-25-years-of-housework,2023-05-18 10:37:26,newagebd
991,"Lambs’s head, a favorite dish for night owls in Bolivia","People pose for a picture before eating a ‘roasted face’, a roasted lamb’s head, a culinary tradition of Oruro, in this Bolivian city on February 18, 2023. -- AFP photo.

At a table on a street corner in Oruro in western Bolivia, night owls get ready to tuck into a favorite dish touted as a hangover cure: roasted lamb’s head.

Late-night diners savor every part of the head, using their fingers to pull off bites of meat and brain.

Doris Cuba is ‘continuing the tradition’ started by her grandmother in serving the dish every Friday to Sunday from 5:00 pm to 6:00 am.

‘You will not find it anywhere else, even less so in a chic restaurant,’ said the 48-year-old, with a smile.

Once they have been cleaned and seasoned with salt, the lamb’s heads are baked in a wood-fired oven for seven to eight hours, then eaten with bread and chilli pepper.

‘My grandmother sold them wrapped in newspaper, with the skin, the wool and everything,’ said Cuba, who peels the baked skull while it is still hot and then breaks it open to make it easier to eat.

In her grandmother’s era, customers would split the skulls themselves ‘on the ground or against a wall.’

The sisters serve a steady stream of customers through the brisk nights of the Bolivian altiplano, which at 3,700 meters (12,000 feet) sees summer temperatures of between six and 19 degrees Celsius (42-66 degrees Fahrenheit).

On a recent evening, a dozen diners lined up in front of a steaming container full of cooked heads, eager to dig into meat tenderized by the long cooking time.

Customers use forks to pierce the lamb eyeballs, sending black liquid squirting from the pupils.

When bitten into, the texture resembles sweetbread.

The creamy consistency of the brain is ‘like butter,’ said Cuba’s sister, 40-year-old Claudia Arispe.

But the tongue is most coveted and is known as the ‘dessert’ of the head.

‘It’s a sheep’s head, but I had to try it,’ said student Angel Pacheco, 25, of his first taste of the dish.

Not just a Bolivian tradition, sheep’s head is known as ‘smiley’ in South Africa, so dubbed because of the way the animal’s teeth are exposed as it’s cooked.

‘There’s not much meat but the truth is that it’s quite exquisite,’ said telecoms employee Ivan Nino de Guzman, 46.

He said it was important to eat the dish quickly so the meat does not go cold.

On public holidays, such as the Oruro carnival, Cuba said they can sell up to 200 roasted heads, at the equivalent of around $7 each.

It is enough to support two families and pay the business overheads.

The sisters refuse to reveal how they cook the heads -- a family secret handed down by their grandmother.

‘It must be tender, you need a little lamb,’ said Cuba, whose daughters also work in the family business.

‘They will sell when I can’t... so we don’t lose the family tradition.’

The new generation also handles promotion on social media of the restaurant, named ‘Rostro Asado Dona Chavelita’, or Mrs Chavelita’s roasted head, in tribute to the sisters’ grandmother.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/196342/lambss-head-a-favorite-dish-for-night-owls-in-bolivia,2023-05-18 10:37:27,newagebd
992,"UN urges $3b aid for Sudan, refugees","Smoke billows in Khartoum on Wednesday, as clashes continue in war-torn Sudan. — AFP photo

The United Nations on Wednesday said $3.03 billion would be needed to provide urgent aid in conflict-ravaged Sudan and for over one million expected to flee into neighbouring countries this year.

Needs have soared since a bloody conflict erupted in Sudan last month, the UN said, dramatically revising up its response plan.

‘Today, 25 million people — more than half the population of Sudan — needs humanitarian aid and protection,’ Ramesh Rajasingham, head of the UN humanitarian agency’s Geneva bureau, told reporters.

‘That is the highest number we have ever seen in the country.’

Battles erupted on April 15 between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who leads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.

Around 1,000 people have been killed, in and around Khartoum and the ravaged state of West Darfur, according to medics.

More than 5,000 people have been injured and millions more remain confined to their homes, unable to access basic services and health care, Rajasingham said.

He also pointed to ‘worrying reports of increased sexual violence’, and warned ‘children are especially vulnerable in this chaos that is unfolding’.

The fighting has deepened the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, where one in three already relied on assistance before the war.

The UN said $2.56 billion is now expected to be needed to provide assistance inside Sudan — up from $1.75 billion estimated at the end of last year.

Those funds will allow aid agencies to reach 18 million of the most vulnerable people inside the country, Rajasingham said.

He lamented that the humanitarian community had suffered numerous attacks, with aid workers killed, offices and stockpiles looted.

He voiced hope that an agreement reached by the two sides last week to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure and to let in badly needed aid was having some effect.

He said fighters had pulled back from some of the health facilities previously occupied and highlighted an uptick in aid deliveries, but added: ‘We do need much more.’

‘The crisis in Sudan is rapidly evolving into a regional crisis.’

The UN refugee agency said $470.4 million would be needed to assist those fleeing the country and it was now planning for up to 1.1 million people to leave Sudan this year.

Just two weeks ago, UNHCR had said it would need $445 million through October to address the needs of as many as 8,60,000 people who might flee.

‘So far, the crisis resulted in massive outflows into neighbouring countries of about 2,20,000 refugees and returnees,’ Raouf Mazou, assistant chief of operations at the UN refugee agency UNHCR told reporters.

In addition, more than 7,00,000 people have been displaced inside Sudan by the fighting.

Of the more than one million expected to leave Sudan, 6,40,000 would likely be Sudanese refugees and 2,04,000 people who had been living as refugees inside Sudan, returning to their home country, primarily South Sudan, the UN said.

Prior to the conflict, Sudan was hosting around 1.1 million refugees.

‘Those who have fled across the country’s many borders are shattered, often having left behind or lost loved ones and finding themselves in places where access is extremely hard and resources are minimal,’ Mazou said.

He pointed out that those fleeing Sudan were in many cases arriving in ‘very, very remote locations’ which were difficult to access’, in countries where humanitarian needs were severely under-funded.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201930/un-urges-3b-aid-for-sudan-refugees,2023-05-18 10:37:28,newagebd
993,Nepali mountaineer climbs Everest for 27th time,"Nepali climber Kami Rita Sherpa reached the top of Mount Everest for the 27th time on Wednesday, reclaiming the record for the most summits of the world’s highest mountain.

‘He successfully reached the summit this morning guiding a Vietnamese climber,’ Mingma Sherpa of Seven Summit Treks, his expedition organiser, said.

Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 10 highest peaks, including the 8,849-metre Everest, and welcomes hundreds of adventurers each spring, when temperatures are warm and winds are typically calm.

Earlier Wednesday, British guide Kenton Cool reached the world’s highest point for the 17th time, extending his own record for the most summits by a non-Nepali.

Meanwhile, a 46-year-old Moldovan climber died on the mountain the same day — the fifth fatality of the season.

Authorities have issued 478 Everest permits to foreign climbers this year, the $11,000 fee part of total costs for a summit ranging from $45,000 to $2,00,000.

Since most will need a guide, more than 900 people — a record — will try to summit this season, which runs until early June.

The 53-year-old Kami Rita Sherpa had held the overall title since 2018, when he ascended Everest for the 22nd time, passing the previous mark he shared with two other Sherpa climbers, both of whom have since retired.

But on Sunday another climber, Pasang Dawa Sherpa, 46, tied the record by reaching the top for the 26th time.

A guide for more than two decades, Kami Rita Sherpa first summited in 1994 when working for a commercial expedition.

Since then, he has climbed Everest almost every year, several times leading the first rope-fixing team to open the route to the top.

‘These records were made not with an intention to make them but during my work as a guide,’ Sherpa said last month as he headed to base camp.

Dubbed ‘the Everest man’, Sherpa was born in 1970 in Thame, a village in the Himalayas renowned as a breeding ground for successful mountaineers.

Growing up, Sherpa watched his father and then his brother don climbing gear to join expeditions as mountain guides, and was soon following in their footsteps.

In 2019, he reached the summit twice in the span of six days.

Sherpa’s client Wednesday was reportedly Chinh Chu, a Vietnamese billionaire who made his fortune in finance, while Cool guided Richard Walker, executive chairman of British supermarket chain Iceland Foods, to the top.

Nepali guides, usually ethnic Sherpas from the valleys around Everest, are considered the backbone of the climbing industry and bear huge risks to carry equipment and food, fix ropes and repair ladders.

Cool, 49, first climbed Everest in 2004, and his 16th ascent last year gave him the sole record for the most summits by a non-Nepali climber, but he told AFP then that he was ‘surprised’ by the attention.

‘In reality, it’s not that amazing,’ he said, pointing out that many Sherpa guides had stood on the peak more often than him.

‘People go ‘it’s a world record’, it’s not a world record,’ he said. ‘It’s just that I happen to hold the non-Sherpa record, for whatever that is worth, which in my mind, (is) not very much.’

The Moldovan climber died at Camp 4, said Expedition Himalaya, which arranged his permit.

‘He felt unwell at South Col and despite many attempts to provide him aid he passed away,’ the company said.

Three Nepali climbers died on the mountain last month when a block of glacial ice fell and swept them into a deep crevasse as they were crossing the treacherous Khumbu icefall as part of a supply mission.

The season’s toll rose to four when a 69-year-old US mountaineer died this month during his acclimatisation rotation at around 6,400 metres.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201926/nepali-mountaineer-climbs-everest-for-27th-time,2023-05-18 10:37:29,newagebd
994,Liz Truss urges UK to get tough with China on Taiwan,"Liz Truss

Britain’s former prime minister Liz Truss on Wednesday urged her successor Rishi Sunak to get tough with China on Taiwan, describing the democratic island as ‘an enduring rebuke to totalitarianism’.

China considers self-ruled Taiwan to be its territory, to be taken one day by force if necessary, and strongly opposes any formal engagement with the island, including by high-profile foreign political figures.

Truss, who is on a five-day visit to Taiwan, accused Sunak and other Western governments of ‘trying to cling on to the idea that we can cooperate with China on issues like climate change, as if there is nothing wrong’.

‘But without freedom and democracy, there is nothing else. We know what happens to the environment or world health under totalitarian regimes that don’t tell the truth,’ she said.

‘You can’t believe a word they (China) say.’

Truss also called on Sunak to make good on his pledge during the Conservative leadership campaign last year to designate China a strategic ‘threat’, and went on to say the West could not avoid another ‘Cold War’ with Beijing.

It is ‘absolutely clear’ that Chinese president Xi Jinping ‘has ambitions to take Taiwan’, she added at a press conference later.

‘We don’t know exactly when that could take place and we don’t know how all we can do is make sure Taiwan is as protected as possible.’

Sunak has pushed back on the tough rhetoric against China that Truss deployed before and during her 49-day tenure at 10 Downing Street last year.

She was ousted after her radical economic policies crashed financial markets.

Since then, Truss — who is still a sitting MP — has been trying to rebuild her profile with a series of speeches overseas, including in Tokyo, Washington and Copenhagen.

The Chinese government has slammed Truss’s Taiwan visit as a ‘dangerous political show which will do nothing but harm to the UK’.

A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in London accused her of ‘colluding with ‘Taiwan independence’ secessionist forces to provoke confrontation’, in a statement issued before her speech in Taipei.

It added that Truss’s visit would ‘further expose herself as a failed politician’.

The former leader has also faced accusations back home that she is indulging in irresponsible sabre-rattling in a bid to maintain her political relevance.

‘The (Taiwan) trip is performative, not substantive,’ House of Commons foreign relations committee chair Alicia Kearns told The Guardian newspaper last week.

‘It is the worst kind of example of Instagram diplomacy,’ the Conservative said, recalling previous criticism of Truss’s tireless self-promotion on social media.

Kearns added the trip was likely to deepen problems for Taiwan.

Truss defended herself Wednesday by saying she was invited by Taipei, which was ‘best placed to understand what will help Taiwan’s course’.

She added: ‘I think that’s a very dangerous idea that we should allow a totalitarian regime to dictate who goes where in the world.’

Beijing has in recent years stepped up air and sea incursions around Taiwan, whose President Tsai Ing-wen has refused to accept that the island is a part of China.

After a visit to Taiwan by then-speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, China launched massive military drills around the island.

There were more drills this year following a meeting in the United States between Tsai and Pelosi’s successor.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201927/liz-truss-urges-uk-to-get-tough-with-china-on-taiwan,2023-05-18 10:37:30,newagebd
995,Court extends bar on Imran Khan’s arrest in new cases till May 31,"Imran Khan. -- AFP file photo.

The Islamabad High Court has extended its order to prevent the arrest of PTI chairman Imran Khan in cases filed against him after May 9. The extension is effective until May 31, reports DAWN.com.

Last week, an IHC bench accepted Imran’s bail petition in the Al-Qadir Trust case for two weeks, a day after the Supreme Court termed his arrest in the case ‘invalid and unlawful’.

It had also stopped authorities from arresting the PTI chief until May 17 in any case registered in Islamabad after May 9 — the day of his arrest.

Today, Imran’s lawyer, Barrister Gohar, represented him in court today. Additional Attorney General Munawar Dugal, Advocate General Islamabad Jahangir Jadoon and state counsel were also present.

The case was heard by Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb. The government’s counsel requested more time to provide information about the cases filed against the PTI chief.

The court granted the request and adjourned the hearing until May 31.

Earlier Tuesday, several reporters chose to boycott the hearings conducted by Justice Aurangzeb. This decision came in response to his alleged directive limiting the journalists in his court to five.

Dawn.com’s reporter, along with several others, was denied access to the case hearing related to the ex-PM’s bail today. Upon inquiry, the court’s deputy registrar revealed that the judge had issued an order allowing only a maximum of five journalists to be present in the courtroom. As a result, the journalists boycotted the hearings conducted by Justice Aurangzeb.

Typically, the IHC permits around 30 journalists to attend proceedings related to the cases of the PTI chief, whereas in other cases, there is no specified limit on the number of attendees.

Imran was whisked away from the IHC premises by paramilitary forces on May 9, leading to violent protests across the country. The PTI chief had immediately approached the high court for release but it had declared his arrest legal.

The former premier’s lawyer, Barrister Ali Zafar, then petitioned the SC on his behalf for Imran’s release.

Subsequently, the Supreme Court on Thursday termed Imran’s arrest in the Al-Qadir Trust case ‘unlawful’ and directed him to appear before the Islamabad High Court a day later.

‘The manner of execution of the arrest warrant issued by the chairman, National Accountability Bureau dated 01.05.2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case within the premises of the Islamabad High Court against the petitioner is invalid and unlawful,’ the ruling had said.

The top court had also highlighted that the fundamental rights of the petitioner under Articles 4, 9, 10-A and 14 of the Constitution had been infringed.

Later on Friday, the PTI chairman was granted a blanket relief from different benches of the IHC that not only barred the authorities from arresting him but also stayed his trial in the Toshakhana case until the second week of June.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201915/court-extends-bar-on-imran-khans-arrest-in-new-cases-till-may-31,2023-05-18 10:37:31,newagebd
996,US convoy attacked in SE Nigeria,"Gunmen attacked a US convoy in southeast Nigeria’s Anambra State on Tuesday, police and a US official said, killing four people and abducting three others.

Separatists who operate in the region have escalated their attacks in recent years, usually targeting police or government buildings.

‘No US citizen was in the convoy,’ said police spokesman Ikenga Tochukwu.

The gunmen ‘murdered two of the Police Mobile Force operatives and two staff of the consulate,’ he said, before setting their vehicle ‘ablaze’.

The attack took place on Tuesday at ‘3:30pm (14:30 GMT) along Atani, Osamale road’ in Ogbaru district, according to the police.

Joint security forces deployed to the scene, said Tochukwu, but the gunmen managed to abduct two police operatives and a driver.

A ‘rescue/recovery operation’ was underway Tuesday evening, he added in his statement.

US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby confirmed the attack during a briefing with reporters in Washington DC.

‘A US convoy of vehicles was attacked. What I can tell you is that no US citizens were involved,’ Kirby said.

The State Department also confirmed the attack.

‘US Mission Nigeria personnel are working with Nigerian security services to investigate,’ a spokesperson said.

‘The security of our personnel is always paramount, and we take extensive precautions when organising trips to the field.’

Nigerian officials often blame attacks in the southeast on the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra movement and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network.

IPOB has repeatedly denied responsibility for the violence.

The group’s leader Nnamdi Kanu is in government custody and faces trial for treason after being detained overseas and brought back to Nigeria.

Separatism is a sensitive issue in Nigeria, where a declaration of an independent Biafra Republic by Igbo army officers in the southeast in 1967 triggered a three-year civil war that left more than one million dead.

Violence in the southeast is just one of the many issues facing president-elect Bola Tinubu, who takes the helm of Africa’s most populous nation later this month.

The military is also battling a 14-year-old jihadist insurgency in the northeast, gangs who kidnap and kill in the northwest and central states and piracy in the Gulf of Guinea.

After a brief calm period during February and March elections for the presidency and governorships, attacks have been on the rise in the last few weeks.

Former Anambra State Governor Peter Obi, who ran and lost in the February 25 presidential election, is one of those contesting Tinubu’s victory, claiming fraud.

The electoral commission has recognised ‘glitches’ during the vote but has dismissed claims that the process was not free and fair.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201897/us-convoy-attacked-in-se-nigeria,2023-05-18 10:37:32,newagebd
997,Turkey’s opposition plots fightback against Erdogan,"Turkey’s opposition tried on Wednesday to recover from a crushingly disappointing election performance and launch a new attack aimed at beating president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a May 28 runoff.

Secular leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu huddled with the other five heads of his alliance on Wednesday to plot a harder-edged strategy for ending Erdogan’s two-decade domination of Turkey.

Media reports said he had fired his PR team and planned to tap Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu — a feisty figure with a history of bad blood with Erdogan — to spearhead his campaign.

The reported promotion of Imamoglu and the mayor’s lauded strategist Canan Kaftancioglu marks a reversal for Turkey’s grandfatherly opposition leader.

The 74-year-old former civil servant tried to run an inclusive campaign that addressed voters in chatty clips recorded from his kitchen and ignored Erdogan’s personal barbs.

That approach worked — up to a point.

The opposition deprived Erdogan of a first-round victory for the first time and collected more votes than in any point of his rule.

But Kilicdaroglu’s 44.9 per cent still trailed Erdogan’s 49.5 per cent of the votes.

Pre-election polls showed Kilicdaroglu leading and possibly even winning outright last Sunday.

Kilicdaroglu’s fightback began with a video on Tuesday in which he stared straight into the camera and slapped his desk a few times after banging his heart with his fist.

‘I am here! I am here!’ he shouted. ‘I am here!’

Erdogan looked far more relaxed as he assessed his performance on late-night television on Tuesday.

The 69-year-old conceded that his Islamic-rooted party had lost a few seats in parliament and suffered from ‘slight deficiencies’.

Provisional results showed his conservative alliance’s share falling from 333 to 322 in the 600-seat parliament.

‘Unfortunately, my party suffered some declines, there is a slight deficiency,’ Erdogan said in the interview.

‘We need to make our preparations to eliminate them. We will do our internal accounting and take the necessary steps.’

It was a rare admission for Turkey’s longest-serving leader.

But he spoke in measured tones befitting an incumbent who is entering the second round as the overwhelming favourite.

The remaining votes went to a little-known ultra-nationalist who has much more in common with the right-wing Erdogan than the leftist Kilicdaroglu.

Erdogan said he would visit southeastern regions this weekend that were hit by a catastrophic February quake in which more than 50,000 lost their lives.

The president retained strong support in the area despite initial anger at the government’s delayed search and rescue work.

Erdogan added that his team will be meeting with younger voters in Istanbul and Ankara to try and win in Turkey’s two most important cities.

Imamoglu and Ankara mayor Mansur Yavas beat out Erdogan’s allies in 2019 municipal polls.

The campaign’s second stage is being accompanied by Turkish market turmoil that has seen the lira near historic lows against the dollar.

Investors are starting to price in an Erdogan victory and the long-term continuation of his unconventional economic policies.

The cost of insuring exposure to Turkey’s debt is rising out of fears that the country’s once-vibrant banking sector could soon experience serious difficulties.

Erdogan’s decision to force Turkey’s central bank to fight historically high inflation with lower interest rates has put unprecedented pressure on the lira.

Analysts believe Erdogan tried to prop up the lira ahead of elections through indirect market interventions that drained Turkey’s hard currency reserves.

His government also introduced rules that required banks to purchase more and more liras with their foreign currencies.

Some analysts warn Turkey might have to impose capital controls if Erdogan — who has pledged to keep interest rates low as long as he remains in office — does not reverse course.

‘Our focus after the election will be whether the policy mix becomes more credible and consistent,’ the ratings agency Fitch said.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201945/turkeys-opposition-plots-fightback-against-erdogan,2023-05-18 10:37:33,newagebd
998,Portugal president signs law decriminalising euthanasia,"Portugal’s president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. – AFP photo.

Portugal’s conservative president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa on Tuesday signed into law a bill decriminalising euthanasia adopted by parliament in the past week, after a painstaking legislative process.

The issue has divided the deeply Catholic country and witnessed strong opposition from De Sousa, a devout churchgoer.

‘The president of the republic has issued the decree... as he was obliged to do’ by the constitution, the presidency said in a statement.

The final version of the ‘medically assisted dying’ law was adopted last Friday with 129 votes in favour in the 230-seat parliament, including those of the ruling Socialist Party.

‘The constitution obliges the president to enact a law which he has vetoed and which has (then) been confirmed by the Assembly of the Republic. I will sign it, of course, it is my constitutional duty,’ De Sousa said after the vote.

A majority of lawmakers had already voted four times in favour of decriminalising assisted dying over the past three years.

But the text faced objections from the constitutional court and the head of state, a practising Catholic.

In order to overcome the president’s last veto, the Socialists decided to vote on the same text a second time.

The law had been redrafted several times to take into account remarks by De Sousa, who has twice vetoed it, and after being rejected twice by the constitutional court, which had pointed to certain ‘inaccuracies’.

The final version of the law states that euthanasia is only allowed in cases where ‘medically assisted suicide is impossible due to a physical incapacitation of the patient’.

Following the publication of the decrees, the law could come into force next autumn, according to estimates cited by the local press.

Euthanasia and assisted suicide are currently allowed in a handful of European countries, such as the Benelux countries, which were the first to allow it, and neighbouring Spain.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201888/portugal-president-signs-law-decriminalising-euthanasia,2023-05-18 10:37:34,newagebd
999,Eight killed in Italy flood,"Eight people died and thousands were evacuated from their homes after heavy rains caused devastation across Italy’s northern Emilia Romagna region, while this weekend’s Imola Grand Prix was cancelled, officials said on Wednesday.

‘The city is on its knees, devastated and in pain,’ said Gian Luca Zattini, the mayor of Forli, a city near Bologna where three people were confirmed dead earlier Wednesday. ‘It’s the end of the world.’

Emilia Romagna’s vice president, Irene Priolo, later told reporters that a total of eight people had died, with several others missing.

Two of the bodies in Forli were recovered by divers on Wednesday morning, as part of a huge rescue effort involving emergency services and the armed forces.

Emilia Romagna, one of Italy’s richest regions, had already been hit by heavy rain just a fortnight ago, causing floods that left two dead.

This time, around 50 centimetres of rain fell within 36 hours in Forli, Cesena and Ravenna — around half the normal annual rainfall, a situation ‘with few precedents’, Italy’s Civil Protection Minister Nello Musumeci said.

‘It is still a very critical situation,’ he told reporters, adding that while the rain was still falling, it was expected to lighten during the day.

The flooding caused the cancellation of the Formula One Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, which had been set for on Sunday in Imola.

Organisers said they could not guarantee the safety of fans, teams and staff.

‘It would not be right to put further pressure on the local authorities and emergency services at this difficult time,’ they said.

Regional president Stefano Bonaccini said Emilia Romagna had been hit ‘like an earthquake’.

Rescue workers had worked through the night to save children, the elderly and the disabled from the rising waters.

‘We’re scared, this time we’re scared,’ said Simona Matassoni, the owner of the Hotel Savio in Cesena, which has so far escaped flooding.

‘I was born here, I’ve seen lots of full rivers, but never anything like this,’ she said by telephone on Wednesday morning, adding that it was still raining.

‘At the moment we’re crossing our fingers but another flood is expected, so who knows (what will happen).’

Some 3,000 people had been evacuated from their homes in Bologna, while the mayor of Ravenna said some 5,000 people were being evacuated as a precaution. Around 50,000 people were without electricity.

Twenty-one rivers in the region had broken their banks between Tuesday and Wednesday, while 36 local authorities reported flooding and 48 reporting landslides.

The civil protection agency urged ‘maximum caution’, as mayors warned people to stay on high ground.

In Forli, an AFP photographer saw people in a state of shock as they fled on Tuesday night through floodwaters in the dark in their bare feet.

Images showed streets transformed into rivers, and firemen moving people to safety in rubber dinghies.

Elsewhere, muddy waters rushed at great speed under the arches of the covered walkways in Bologna, while locals in Cesena swam down a road to rescue a three-year-old child.

‘We absolutely must not lower our guard,’ Cesena mayor Enzo Lattuca said on Facebook.

Residents ‘must not under any account go into basements or cellars’, and should ‘stay out of ground floors if possible’, he said.

Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, on her way to the G7 summit in Japan, tweeted her support for those affected and said the government was ‘ready to intervene with the necessary aid’.

Much of northern Italy suffered a drought last winter, on top of a record lack of rain last summer that ruined harvests.

However, spring has been wetter and colder than normal across the country.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201928/eight-killed-in-italy-flood,2023-05-18 10:37:35,newagebd
1000,Asia heatwaves made 30 times more likely by climate change: study,"Climate change made record-breaking deadly heatwaves in Bangladesh, India, Laos and Thailand last month at least 30 times more likely, according to a study published on Wednesday.

Parts of India saw temperatures above 44 degrees Celsius in mid-April, with at least 11 deaths near Mumbai attributed to heat stroke on a single day. In Bangladesh, Dhaka suffered its hottest day in almost 60 years.

The city of Tak in Thailand saw its highest-ever temperature of 45.4 Celsius, while Sainyabuli province in Laos hit 42.9 Celsius, an all-time national temperature record, the study by the World Weather Attribution group said.

Two deaths were reported in Thailand, but the real toll was likely higher as the extreme heat caused widespread hospitalisations, with the poor and vulnerable the worst affected.

The new study by international climate scientists looked at the average maximum temperature and the maximum heat index, which includes humidity.

‘In both regions, the researchers found that climate change made the humid heatwave at least 30 times more likely, with temperatures at least 2 degrees Celsius hotter than they would have been without climate change,’ WWA said in a statement.

‘Until overall greenhouse gas emissions are halted, global temperatures will continue to increase and events like this will become more frequent and severe,’ it added.

The analysis also found that such events in India and Bangladesh, previously once-a-century, can now be expected around once every five years because of human-caused climate change.

For Laos and Thailand, if global temperatures rise by two degrees Celsius — as will happen within around 30 years if emissions are not cut rapidly — such extreme events could happen every 20 years, compared to every two centuries now, the study said.

‘We see again and again that climate change dramatically increases the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, one of the deadliest weather events there are,’ said Friederike Otto of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment, who was involved in the study.

‘Still, heat action plans are only being introduced very slowly across the globe. They need to be an absolute priority adaptation action everywhere, but in particular in places where high humidity enhances the impacts of heatwaves,’ she added.

Scientists were previously reluctant to directly link a particular event to climate change, but in recent years a new field of ‘attribution science’, like that done by the WWA, has emerged.

Some weather events have a more complicated relationship to global warming than others, with the relationship to heatwaves and increased rainfall relatively easy to study.

Other phenomena such as droughts, snowstorms, tropical storms and wildfires are more complicated however, according to the WWA.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201944/asia-heatwaves-made-30-times-more-likely-by-climate-change-study,2023-05-18 10:37:36,newagebd
1001,Assam police to offer VRS to obese personnel,"The Assam Police on Tuesday said it will start offering voluntary retirement to all obese personnel if they fail to reduce their weight by November this year, reports outlookindia.

Director-General of Police Gyanendra Pratap Singh said the decision was taken on the direction of chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.

‘@assampolice Hq has decided to go in for the professional recording of Body Mass Index of all Assam Police personnel including IPS/APS officers and all DEF/Bn/Organisations,’ he tweeted.

It has been decided to give three months to all personnel, including IPS and Assam Police Services officers, till August 15, and then start BMI assessment, Singh said.

‘All those who are in the obese (BMI 30+) category would be offered another three months to reduce weight (till November end) and after that VRS option except those who have genuine medical grounds like thyroidism etc (sic),’ he added.

The DGP further said that he will be the first one in the force to record the BMI on August 16.

On May 8, Singh had said that the Assam Police drew up a list of about 680 personnel, who are habitual drinkers or obese, and after a multi-tier review, those found unfit for duty will be offered voluntary retirement.

In April, the chief minister had said that around 300 officers and personnel of Assam Police would be handed retirement due to their problem of alcoholism.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201925/assam-police-to-offer-vrs-to-obese-personnel,2023-05-18 10:37:37,newagebd
1002,Over 30 people killed in clashes in central Nigeria,"Map of Nigeria.

Over 30 people have been killed in clashes between herders and farmers in central Nigeria’s Plateau State, a local official said on Tuesday.

The region, on the dividing line between Nigeria’s mostly Muslim north and mainly Christian south, has for years struggled with ethnic and religious violence.

‘The incident has affected more than 30 people, they lost their lives,’ Plateau State Commissioner of Information and Communication Dan Manjang told AFP.

He said the clashes took place on Monday between herders, who are most often Muslim, and farmers, who are generally Christian.

Police said the violence took place ‘in various villages’ in Bwoi, in Mangu district.

‘At about 11:56 am (1056 GMT) a distress call was received,’ police spokesman Alfred Alabo said, with a report of gunmen ‘shooting sporadically’.

Security officials were deployed to the area, he said in a statement, where they engaged the ‘hoodlums’ -- a term used in Nigeria to describe criminals.

The violence in northwest and central Nigeria has spiralled from tit-for-tat killings into broader criminality, with heavily-armed gangs attacking villages for raids, mass kidnappings and looting.

‘As we speak, the culprits are on the run while our officers are still on their trail with the aim to ensure that they are neutralised and if possible, arrested,’ Alabo said.

The chairman of Mangu district has imposed a 24-hour curfew, he added, ‘to ensure that the crisis does not escalate to other areas’.

In April, nearly 50 people were killed when gunmen attacked a village in neighbouring Benue State, in violence local officials blamed on herdsmen.

Benue has been among the hardest hit by intercommunal clashes between farmers and herders who are accused of destroying farmland with their cattle grazing.

President-elect Bola Tinubu, who takes the helm of Africa’s most populous nation later this month, is facing multiple security challenges.

The military is battling a 14-year-old jihadist insurgency in the northeast, separatist tensions in the southeast, piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, and kidnappings by armed criminals across the country.

Violence has been on the rise in the last few weeks after a brief calm period during February and March elections for the presidency and governorships.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201887/over-30-people-killed-in-clashes-in-central-nigeria,2023-05-18 10:37:38,newagebd
1003,Ukraine downs Russian barrage,"Ukrainian servicemen near the frontline city of Bakhmut on April 30, 2023. --AFP photo

Ukraine said on Tuesday it had downed an entire barrage of Russian drones and missiles overnight — including six hypersonic Kinzhal missiles — hours ahead of a visit from China’s special envoy.

The wave of strikes came just over a week after Kyiv announced it had shot down a Kinzhal nuclear-capable hypersonic missile for the first time, using US-supplied Patriot systems.

Ukraine’s mounting success in taking out dozens of Russian drones and missiles illustrates its bolstered air defences, after a winter of Moscow’s strikes on key infrastructure.

‘Another unbelievable success for the Ukrainian air forces!’ defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said in a Twitter post.

The defence ministry said Ukrainian air defence systems had knocked out a total of 18 missiles, including types the Kremlin had touted as ‘ideal’, as well as nine drones.

Three people were injured in Kyiv and some rocket fragments fell on the capital’s zoo, but neither staff nor animals were hurt, mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said.

Russia said all the targets assigned by its military had been hit.

China’s special envoy, Li Hui, was expected to arrive in Kyiv for a two-day visit as part of a European tour to promote Beijing-led peace negotiations on the war in Ukraine.

A senior Ukrainian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ukrainian authorities planned to further discuss Kyiv’s stance on the conflict and China’s peace mission.

‘The president already said at the Vatican that we don’t need mediation for the sake of mediation,’ the official said, referring to Zelensky’s recent talks with Pope Francis.

He said the same message would be relayed to Beijing’s envoy.

‘Ending the war with a compromise at the expense of Ukraine will not work.’

Li will become the highest-ranking Chinese diplomat to visit the war-torn country since Moscow’s invasion last year. His trip comes three weeks after Zelensky spoke by telephone to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Beijing has said the aim of the tour is to ‘communicate with all parties on the political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis’.

Xi, who has aimed to position China as a neutral mediator and visited Moscow in March, has been criticised for refusing to condemn the Kremlin’s attack on its neighbour.

Li’s visit follows hot on the heels of Zelensky’s whirlwind tour of major European capitals to urge Ukraine’s allies to increase military support.

His tour to shore up military assistance to help make his troops more battle-ready began in Italy, with weekend visits to France and Germany, followed by a stop in the UK.

But Zelensky has yet to succeed in his goal of enlisting Western fighter jets to seize command of the skies, although UK prime minister Rishi Sunak announced on Monday preparations to open a flight school to train Ukrainian pilots.

France, too, has offered to train Ukrainian fighter pilots, although president Emmanuel Macron ruled out sending warplanes to Kyiv.

Nevertheless, Zelensky said late on Monday he was ‘returning home with new defence packages’.

On the front line, fighting has picked up in the eastern Donetsk region, in particular for the battle-scarred city of Bakhmut.

In recent days, Ukraine has been posting its first gains around the city in weeks and the head of Russia’s Wagner paramilitary group has blasted the performance of Moscow’s regular troops around the key city.

The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Tuesday he had visited Bakhmut to hand out awards to troops fighting in the longest battle of the invasion.

‘Wagner’s men went into Bakhmut like rats into a mousetrap,’ he said.

‘Using the principle of active defence, we are using counter-offensive actions in some areas near Bakhmut,’ he added.

The British defence ministry said that ‘over the last four days, Ukrainian forces have made tactical progress, stabilising the flanks of Bakhmut to their advantage’.

The head of the Donetsk region, where Bakhmut is located, announced on Tuesday that five civilians had been killed and four more injured in fighting in the previous 24 hours.

The conflict triggered fears of a global food crisis last year when major Ukrainian ports were blocked by Moscow’s warships.

On Tuesday, Russia said it was still undecided as to whether it would renew its participation in a landmark grain export deal with Ukraine, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey and due to expire on Thursday.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201841/ukraine-downs-russian-barrage,2023-05-18 10:37:39,newagebd
1004,Cyclone Mocha death toll rises to 81 in Myanmar,"Boys walk past destroyed houses at Ohn Taw Chay camp in Sittwe on Tuesday, in the aftermath of Cyclone Mocha’s landfall. —AFP photo

The death toll in cyclone-hit Myanmar rose to at least 81 on Tuesday, according to local leaders, officials and state media, as villagers tried to piece together ruined homes and waited for aid and support.

Mocha made landfall on Sunday with winds of up to 195 kilometres per hour, downing power pylons and smashing wooden fishing boats to splinters.

At least 46 people died in the Rakhine state villages of Bu Ma and nearby Khaung Doke Kar, inhabited by the persecuted Rohingya Muslim minority, local leaders told AFP reporters at the scene.

Thirteen people were killed when a monastery collapsed in a village in Rathedaung township north of Rakhine’s capital Sittwe, and a woman died when a building collapsed in a neighbouring village, according to Myanmar state broadcaster MRTV.

‘There will be more deaths, as more than a hundred people are missing,’ said Karlo, the head of Bu Ma village near Sittwe.

Nearby, Aa Bul Hu Son, 66, said prayers at the grave of his daughter, whose body was recovered on Tuesday morning.

‘I wasn’t in good health before the cyclone, so we were delayed in moving to another place,’ he told AFP.

‘While we were thinking about moving, the waves came immediately and

took us.’

‘I just found her body in the lake in the village and buried her right away. I can’t find any words to express my loss.’

Other residents walked the seashore searching for family members swept away by a storm surge that accompanied the cyclone, AFP correspondents said.

Nine people died in Dapaing camp for displaced Rohingya near Sittwe, its leader told AFP, adding the camp was cut off and lacked supplies.

‘People cannot come to our camp because bridges are broken... we need help,’ he said.

One person was killed in Ohn Taw Chay village and six in Ohn Taw Gyi, local leaders and officials told AFP.

State media had reported five deaths on Monday, without offering details.

Mocha was the most powerful cyclone to hit the area in more than a decade, churning up villages, uprooting trees and knocking out communications across much of Rakhine state.

China said it was ‘willing to provide emergency disaster relief assistance’, according to a statement on its embassy in Myanmar’s Facebook page.

The United Nations refugee office said it was investigating reports that Rohingya living in displacement camps had been killed in the storm.

It was ‘working to start rapid needs assessments in hard-hit areas’ of Rakhine state, it added.

Widely viewed as interlopers in Myanmar, the Rohingya are denied citizenship and healthcare, and require permission to travel outside their villages in western Rakhine state.

Many others live in camps after being displaced by decades of ethnic conflict in the state.

In neighbouring Bangladesh, officials told AFP that no one had died in the cyclone, which passed close to sprawling refugee camps that house almost one million Rohingya who fled a Myanmar military crackdown in 2017.

‘Although the impact of the cyclone could have been much worse, the refugee camps have been severely affected, leaving thousands desperately needing help,’ the UN said as it made an urgent appeal for aid late Monday.

Cyclones—the equivalent of hurricanes in the North Atlantic or typhoons in the Northwest Pacific—are a regular and deadly menace on the coast of the northern Indian Ocean where tens of millions of people live.

Non-profit ClimateAnalytics said rising temperatures may have contributed to Cyclone Mocha’s intensity.

‘We can see sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal in the last month have been significantly higher than they were even 20 years ago,’ said the group’s Peter Pfleiderer.

‘Warmer oceans allow storms to gather power, quickly, and this has devastating consequences for people.’

On Tuesday, contact was slowly being restored with Sittwe, which is home to around 150,000 people, AFP reporters said, with roads being cleared and internet connections re-established.

Photos released by state media showed Rakhine-bound aid being loaded onto a ship in the commercial hub Yangon.

Rohingya villagers told AFP they were yet to receive any assistance.

‘No government, no organisation has come to our village,’ said Kyaw Swar Win, 38, from Basara village.

‘We haven’t eaten for two days... We haven’t got anything and all I can say is that no one has even come to ask.’",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201833/cyclone-mocha-death-toll-rises-to-81-in-myanmar,2023-05-18 10:37:40,newagebd
1005,Imbroglio of BRTC buses going beyond economic repair,"THE state-run Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation, which is mandated to issue buses and maintain public transports but is often said to have failed in the task, has discarded 485 buses since 2020 as beyond economic repair, which is generally a state wherein the estimated repair cost of a unit exceeds more than three-fourths of the replacement worth. This is worrying at a time time when the agency fails to live up to its mandate. But what is more worrying is that the agency discarded 250 of the buses only in 2022. The agency is reported to have sold the discarded buses, which could not be serviced, as scrap. The agency had 1,350 buses in its fleet on May 14, with 1,237 having been in service and 113 needing heavy repairs. It had 1,600 buses in May 2022, 1,611 in January 2022, 1,762 in December 2021, 1,835 in August 2020 and 1,536 in June 2017, as officials said. The decline in the number of buses from August 2020 to May 2023 is too fast and the agency chief seeks to say that the agency had 1,800 buses in its fleet, only 900 were serviceable. All the figures bring to the fore a few issues for the authorities to seriously attend to.

Two hundred and fifty buses having gone out of service as being beyond economic repair in one year or even 485 buses having gone beyond economic repair in about three years suggests a serious lack of maintenance of the vehicles in the BRTC fleet. Another issue that the authorities need to look into is whether the buses that are sold off as scrap were serviceable at all. The buses thus sold off could very well get back on the road after they reach private hands. The authorities, therefore, need to investigate why such a large number of buses get out of service in such a short time and whether there is any nexus at play in the process. The state-run agency now works on two projects to buy new buses and add them to the fleet. It is procuring 100 air-conditioned, electric double-deckers under an Indian line of credits for Tk 11.54 billion in April 2023–June 2025 and 340 air-conditioned buses run on compressed natural gas under the Economic Development Cooperation Fund for Tk 11.33 billion in June 2023–June 2025. The agency would, of course, procure buses if it needs to effectively maintain public transports. But the government should also ensure that the procurement is fairly done as large procurement in most cases also has irregularities, if not corruption, going with it. Electric buses could also help the government to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 22 per cent by 2030 that Bangladesh has committed.

The expansion of the BRTC fleet, especially to meet the growing needs, must in no way be an imbroglio, allowing a waste of public money, an unmanaged operation of public transports and an unaccounted for responsibility of managers of the state-owned road transport agency.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201907/imbroglio-of-brtc-buses-going-beyond-economic-repair,2023-05-18 10:37:40,newagebd
1006,Govt must follow DAP to make Dhaka liveable,"THE government’s decision to approve the commercial use of residential plots in upscale areas in the capital city appears to be another blow to the detailed area plan that aims to make Dhaka a liveable megacity by 2035. In a circular issued on May 3, the housing and public works ministry changed the classification of residential plots into commercial ones for areas such as Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara and Uttara, violating the detailed area plan. Residential plot owners can now, as the circular says, seek approval from the housing and public works ministry for a commercial use of the land provided they get permission from Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha. The roads where commercial use of residential plots will be allowed are Gulshan Avenue, Kamal Ataturk Avenue at Banani, Pragati Sarani at Baridhara, Jasimuddin Avenue, Rabindra Sarani, Sonargaon Janapath, Gausul Azam Avenue, Gareeb-e-Newaz Avenue, Shah Makhdum Avenue, Shahjalal Avenue and Alaol Avenue at Uttara. Plots on either side of roads that are at least 100 feet wide would be allowed for a commercial use. The detailed area plan 2016–2035, however, marks the plots as residential and, therefore, prohibits their commercial use.

The decision, made by ministry reportedly without consultation with the Urban Development Directorate, stands in violation of the detailed area plan and is contrary to the government’s policy of decentralising Dhaka. Consequences of the decision will, as urban planners say, be negative and far-reaching for the capital and its residents. The conversion of residential plots into commercial ones will inevitably alter the areas, increase commercial activities and increase the population density manifold, which will have an impact on the environment. When Dhaka already suffers from many ills of unplanned urbanisation and development — the city is, keeping to the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Global Liveability Index for 2022, the seventh least liveable city in the world — the decision is likely to worsen the quality of life in the city. Urban planners have for long expressed concern about the lack of growth control, the lack of proper management, failures to protect the environment, the mushrooming of commercial units and the encroachment of water bodies and green spaces and have urged the government to be serious about decentralisation and the conservation of green spaces and water bodies. The government has also pledged time and again to take steps to decentralise Dhaka and shift industries gradually out of the city.

The construction and opening of the Padma Bridge and new roads were hoped to help Dhaka’s decentralisation, but the decision appears to be paving the way for Dhaka’s suffocation. The government must, therefore, revise its decision and not let residential plots be used for commercial purposes. The approval already given to some influential people to use residential plots for commercial purposes should be revoked. The government must also not fail to deliver on its commitment to decentralising Dhaka.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/201909/govt-must-follow-dap-to-make-dhaka-liveable,2023-05-18 10:37:41,newagebd
1007,Is Bangladesh getting entangled in game?,"THE prime minister’s statement that Bangladesh will not purchase anything from countries that would impose sanctions took many by surprise because no western country has yet so done. The only sanctions imposed by the west on Bangladesh so far have been those by the United States on the Rapid Action Battalion and senior battalion and police officials for ‘serious human rights violations.’

The prime minister’s statement suggests that she would, perhaps, ignore the US-west’s call for a free and fair election and hold it her way and, therefore, apprehensive of their economic sanctions. There is a bipartisan belief in Bangladesh that the United States and western countries will impose economic sanctions if the Awami League chose to hold elections similar to the 2014 and 2018 elections to remain in power.

The prime minister’s statement is, nevertheless, intriguing because Bangladesh’s economic relations with the United States and the west are extremely asymmetrical. The United States, for instance, has the undeniable power and might to make Bangladesh regret if it pushes Washington towards economic sanctions and retaliates the way the prime minister promised.

Sea changes have occurred in the strategic contexts of Bangladesh’s regional and world politics since the end of the US-led war on terror in August 2021. The US-west was focused on fighting Islamic fundamentalism and Islamic terrorism as issues of utmost strategic importance to them leading to Bangladesh’s controversial elections in 2014 and 2018. They did not want the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to gain power through these two elections because of its alliance with Jamaat. They, thus, looked the other way and allowed the Awami League its second and third terms.

Islamic fundamentalism and Islamic terrorism are no longer indispensable strategic issues of the United States and the west. They have now embraced democracy and human rights as indispensable, instead. These issues have already brought good results for the Democratic Party in the US mid-term elections in 2022. President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party will use these issues again in the US presidential election in 2024.

The Biden administration pursued these issues in Bangladesh as part of its concerns worldwide since it came to power in January 2021 as its foreign and domestic policy goals. It imposed sanctions on the Rapid Action Battalion in pursuit of democracy and human rights. It excluded Bangladesh from Biden’s 110-nation first and second Democracy Summits held in December 2021 and March 2023, thus placing Bangladesh with pariah nations such as Myanmar and North Korea, again for the same reasons.

Most strategic analysts in Bangladesh unfortunately have not seriously focused on these geopolitical developments and realities and their impact on Bangladesh. Many of them felt that the United States and its western allies with India as a key player would give the Awami League a fourth consecutive term to fight China and bring the Indo-Pacific nations together under US-led forums such as the Quad and the Indo-Pacific Strategy against China.

These Bangladeshi analysts have, thus, been in denial about the US call for a free and fair general election in Bangladesh in 2024 that started from the time US ambassador Peter Haas presented his credentials in March 2022. Ambassador Haas’s call was taken up by all the western countries and the United States in Dhaka like a chorus. Yet, anxiety lingered in the minds of these Bangladeshi analysts that the United States encouraged by India was not serious about a free and fair election in Bangladesh.

The prime minister said before leaving for her recent three-nation trip that she would explain to the US leaders the ‘model election’ of her government to meet the US expectations. She was in Washington for five days and, yet, she was unable to meet anyone from the Biden administration which is unprecedented in Bangladesh-US bilateral relations. There was, of course, no reason for them to meet her because before embarking on her visit, she stated in the parliament that Washington was working to change her regime.

The Washington trip and the prime minister’s statement on sanctions, however, flagged the US seriousness for a free and fair general election in Bangladesh. Nevertheless, some of those who doubted the United States all along continue to feel that Washington would eventually come behind the Awami League for a military base in the Bay of Bengal. They believe that the Matarbari deep seaport that some called ‘the game changer’ would eventually become a US military base.

Those who hold this view do so without considering, first, China’s present power and position in the region and the world and, second, the US disinclination to come into a direct conflict with China in the region that a US military base in the bay would certainly lead to. The Chinese ambassador in Dhaka Yao Wen made a milestone address recently at a seminar titled ‘Bangladesh-China Relations: Prognosis for the Future’ which is very important in this context.

Ambassador Wen stated in his presentation clearly that Bangladesh-China relations are ideal, devoid of any tension. He mentioned China’s proactive involvement in Bangladesh’s economic development and further stated that Beijing and Dhaka are currently engaged in discussions for Chinese investments in several strategic projects to underline the strength of Bangladesh-China relations. Wen also underlined China’s focus on anti-China US activities in the region and China’s determination to deal with them. He left no doubt that China would not favour any country in the region should it get involved in these US-led initiatives.

The United States has, meanwhile, also not overtly expressed any intention that it is either seeking to get involved with China militarily or seeking a military base in the bay. The United States is, to the contrary, instead advocating through the Indo-Pacific Strategy ‘a free, open, connected, prosperous, resilient, and secure Indo-Pacific region’ that surprisingly is no different from China’s Belt and Road Initiative with economic connectivity among nations the key element in both. Further, the domestic opinion in the United States, with the country entering its presidential election cycle, is not in favour of war but peace, no doubt as the result of the country’s bad experience from its war on terror.

Therefore, notwithstanding the views of some, the big powers with the ability to influence Bangladesh’s politics, are in no hurry to turn it into a zone of conflict with India’s intention unfortunately not being clear. Japan stated categorically through Iwama Kiminori, its ambassador in Dhaka, that its relations with Bangladesh are economic. Japan has invested in the Matarbari deep-sea project and other projects in Bangladesh hugely. It is aware that its investment would be in jeopardy if China feels that the Matarbari project may eventually become a US military base.

The proponents of the Matarbari project, therefore, have to be cautious and knowledgeable about strategic affairs. Otherwise, Matarbari could push the country towards strategic games of the big powers. They should also consider that Bangladesh could be well served by more investments in its two existing seaports without the Matarbari and that the promise of making Bangladesh the regional economic hub is based on its potential to serve the Seven Sisters, Nepal and Bhutan.

The promise of a hub should ring a bell in the proponents of Matarbari that New Delhi promised in the Awami League’s 2009–2014 term to make Bangladesh the regional connectivity hub with fabulous financial benefits if it gave India land transit which was Bangladesh’s only negotiating card for claiming its critical river water rights from India. Bangladesh is still waiting to become the connectivity hub. The fabulous riches have not reached its coffers. India has still not signed the Teesta deal. Dhaka has, meanwhile, granted India the use of Chattogram and Mangla ports. New Delhi, alas, talks no more of water sharing!

Bangladesh should, therefore, tread with caution about Matarbari which will be operational in 2026. It should develop Matarbari for use by Bangladesh only keeping in perspectives the strategic concerns and the track record of Indian promises. Bangladesh should develop Matarbari also as a negotiating card for its water-sharing rights from India and not play this card away on the vague promise of becoming the regional economic hub.

Bangladesh’s economic future is squarely in the Awami League’s hands now. If it ignores the US and the west’s call for a free and fair general election and brings on Bangladesh the economic sanctions that the prime minister fears, Bangladesh’s economy would be devastated. A free and fair general election should, therefore, be the prayer of every Bangladeshi.

1008,"Padma Bridge in Bangladesh can beat major quakes, shocks: PD","Padma Multipurpose Bridge project director Md Shafiqul Islam talks to New Age in an exclusive interview. — Abdullah Apu

The Padma Bridge is capable of withstanding major natural calamities and other shocks, said the Padma Multipurpose Bridge project director Md Shafiqul Islam.

If the bridge is maintained properly, its longevity will cross 100 years, he said.

The bridge will play an important role in the country’s economic and social development despite some initial challenges, he said.

Shafiqul Islam was talking with New Age recently about the bridge project and the bridge, offering his opinions on numerous issues and aspects of the infrastructure while emphasising that the project cost has not gone up by a single taka in the past seven years.

The Padma Bridge, a much-awaited 6.15-kilometre-long infrastructure for road transports and trains to cross the mighty River Padma between Mawa in Munshiganj and Janjira in Shariatpur, opens June 25, to connect the capital city with the 16 south-western and four central districts of the country.

The bridge project was implemented by the Bangladesh Bridge Authority and Shafiqul Islam has been the project director since 2011.

‘While planning the bridge, we took into account some possible adverse situations,’ he said, adding, ‘For the structure to withstand an earthquake of 8 magnitude in Richter Scale or survive a 62-metre scour in the river we have taken protection measures.’

The bridge designers also devised protection measures for the bridge on the assumption that maximum 4,000-tonne vessels would ply under the bridge.

‘The bridge was designed in a way that it can endure an 8 magnitude earthquake and the impact if a 4,000-tonne ship hits it, while ferries run under the structure are much smaller,’ he said.

Replying to a question, the Padma Bridge project director said that accidents could happen anytime, adding that a proper maintenance of the bridge is therefore necessary.

‘You will have to take care of the bearings and expansions while in the event of scours you will have to dump sand bags in the vulnerable parts of the river without delay,’ he said while making the observation that in Bangladesh many bridges are not maintained properly.

‘This is our fault, not the fault of the infrastructures. Yes, we do still have problems with their maintenance…We do not care about the maintenance of an infrastructure as much as we care about the construction of it,’ Shafiqul further said.

The life expectancy of the Padma Bridge is 100 years, which will be longer if the bridge is properly maintained, he added.

‘Our GDP growth will go up by more than 1.2 per cent as a result of the Padma Bridge,’ said the project director, referring to the economic gains that would accrue from the bridge, adding, ‘Businesspeople are expecting that they will hugely benefit from the direct communication via the bridge.’

He noted that traders of perishable goods and produces such as vegetables, fish and fruits from the south-west districts were saying that they would benefit from the shorter travel time and better prices.

‘Often gains can be greater than projected,’ said Shafiqul, adding, ‘You can see, in the case of the Bangabandhu Bridge on the Jamuna River, benefits are more in reality than what we had estimated,’ he offered.

About the challenges the Padma Bridge project had to beat, the project director talked about when the project was its initial stage.

‘After the 1990 political changeover, when the Awami League came to power in 1996 for the first time, the government got a feasibility study conducted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, which showed that the construction of a bridge on the mighty Padma was feasible,’ he said.

He went on to say that then prime minister Sheikh Hasina laid the foundation stone of the bridge in 2001 but after the next government took over the initiative did not progress at the rate it should have.

‘When the caretaker government came, the initiative saw some progress,’ he said.

In 2007, the caretaker government approved the development project proposal for the Padma Bridge at an estimated cost of Tk 10,191 crore.

Shafiqul said that the project work started progressing in full swing when the Awami League returned to power in 2009 and the design consultant was appointed, who prepared the design of the bridge.

After the design was finalised, the DPP was revised for the first time in March 2011, raising the estimated cost of the bridge to Tk 20,507 crore.

At the time, the World Bank showed interest in funding the project and then the project reached the tendering stage, said the project director.

Then came a setback, he said, following allegations of corruption after which changes came in the positions of minister, secretary and project director and the project office started afresh at the end of 2011.

The government said that it would build the Padma Bridge with own fund, Shafiqul said.

‘We started the bridge work where the World Bank stopped,’ he said.

The World Bank in 2012 cancelled a $1.2 billion loan deal for the bridge project, claiming to have identified ‘possible corruption risks’.

The project director noted that they kept the project document prepared and the contractors pre-qualified by the World Bank.

‘We changed not a thing so that no question could be raised about the quality of the bridge…But yes, we did change only one thing in the document. We replaced the World Bank with the government of Bangladesh as the funding source for the bridge,’ he mentioned.

Replying to a question, the project chief said that many people in Bangladesh had a low self-confidence as to where the project would get so much money — over $3 billon.

‘Many people feared that as a poor country Bangladesh could be in trouble if we give so much money from our budget for only one project. But it has been demonstrated that we did not face problem,’ he explained.

Replying to another question, he said that the cost of the project stood at Tk 30,193 crore afte the second revision of the development project proposal.

‘Till now, we have spent about Tk 25,000 crore,’ he said, adding, ‘We are still hopeful that we won’t have cost overrun.’

He pointed out that they revised the DPP in 2015 for the second time on the basis of the actual tender figures, emphasising that thereafter not a single taka increased in the project cost, which was a record.

He further pointed out that when the then caretaker government approved the development project proposal in 2007 each dollar was worth Tk 69.05.

‘We also said at that time that we only prepared a preliminary design and after the detailed design was prepared there must be a revision,’ he said.

‘The project cost was so intelligently arrived at that the cost has not gone up in the past seven years after the second revision and it won’t not go up,’ he said.

About the natural obstacles faced, Shafiqul said that it was quite normal to face such obstacles as the Padma was the mightiest and most ‘notorious’ river in the world after the Congo and the Amazon.

‘The Padma carries 1.5 lakh cubic metres of water per second and the volume of water flows in the river at the project site in 45 minutes is equivalent to the yearly water consumption in Dhaka. So the current is very strong here,’ he said.

Besides, the river carries one billion tonnes of silt each year, which is also unbelievable to many, he continued, adding that the river also regularly changes its course.

‘It is a swinging river. When I joined as the project director, I saw erosion at the Janjira point, then there was erosion at the Mawa point and if you watch satellite images you would see how many times the river has changed its course meanwhile,’ he said.

The project director noted that they neutralised the risk factors and built the bridge in accordance with a special technical design as the river training and piling works were carried out in view of the changing river course, flow and sediment.

About criticisms by various people of the construction of the bridge, he said that such criticism was a result of lack of self-confidence.

‘In the Jamuna Bridge project, the chief engineer is a British person while I, a Bangladeshi, is the project director,’ he said, adding, ‘So many people suspected that we would compromise on appointing contractors and on quality by using low-quality materials.’

Many people also apprehended that under our management a truly international standard work was not possible but the management proved them wrong, he said.

Replying to a question he said that they had to increase the height of a pile by 22 piers and to use skin grouting piles where soil was soft.

About tolls for the bridge, the project director said that the tolls were 1.5 times higher than the ferry fares.

‘You will have to follow economics in this regard, not what people say. If you don’t follow economics then the country will not develop,’ he said, adding, ‘My work is with the bridge construction. These are my opinions.’

About the role of people engaged in the bridge construction, he disclosed that Bangladeshis were in major roles in the construction as foreigners were the contractors who came here for businesses purposes.

‘The contractors came from different countries while we hired specialists and experts from as many as 30 countries, which is normal, as other countries also do the same,’ he said.

About the pandemic impact on the bridge work, Shafiqul said that they did not stop for a single day though their work did slow down as some experts and some materials got stuck at abroad.

‘We had a very good planning as we created an air-bubble while no one was allowed to leave or enter the project, including me,’ he said.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/174225/padma-bridge-in-bangladesh-can-beat-major-quakes-shocks-pd,2023-05-18 10:37:45,newagebd
1009,"Bangladesh's lone aviation univ prioritises research, development","Muhammad Nazrul Islam

Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Aviation and Aerospace University has enhanced research and development activities in four areas in line with the nation’s goal of becoming a knowledge-based country by 2041.

The thrust areas chosen for the BSMRAAU are constructing prototype single-engine light aircraft, medium-range drones, nano satellites and indigenous rockets, said the university’s vice-chancellor Air Vice-Marshal Muhammad Nazrul Islam in a recent interview with New Age at his Tejgaon office in Bangladesh capital Dhaka.

He noted that the National Perspective Plan 2041 identified the requirement of professional and skilled human resources for the country’s aviation and aerospace sector.

While elaborating updates on the institution’s R & D activities, he narrated how they were trying to enlist services of non-resident Bangladeshi experts to overcome the shortage of quality teachers by paying them affordable consultancy fees.

The VC also said that they were going to shift the university campus from the capital’s Tejgaon in July to its permanent site in Lalmonirhat, a northern town, over 300 kilometres from the capital.

Nazrul Islam, who was appointed as the VC of the country’s lone aviation and aerospace university in July 2021, said that the entity had been giving research and development priority since its inception in February 2019.

According to Nazrul, the lack of research has been a major reason for the country’s low progress in technology, he said.

He stated that the BSMRAAU was going to start building prototype single-engine light aircraft soon with assistance from the country’s Air Force.

Hangers and sites are ready for such aircraft while the import procedures for equipment will be completed soon, he also said.

The production of medium-range drones, which would be able to travel beyond 100 kilometres, has been made a priority for the institution, with emphasis on the development of nano satellites and rockets to capitalise on students’ enthusiasm for research and development.

Already, the fund for the R & D component has been raised 10 times in the current financial year compared with the previous financial year, he said without disclosing the amount.

According to the BSMRAAU VC, drones can be used extensively for agriculture and tourism purposes while the demand for the item in the maritime sector is also high.

He disclosed that they were also developing nano satellites and rockets.

‘Rocket is an integral part of space science,’ he said, adding that they are advancing in this regard in a very methodical ways as rocket science is very critical.

Computer modelling of rocket designs is under way after designs have been completed, he said.

He disclosed that they were also using help from the Air Force to run physical tests of rockets in the coming days.

The university, he went on to say, has entered into collaboration with a number of reputed universities, institutions, research centres and experts for all its four priority areas.

‘We have signed MoUs with the Civil Aviation Authority, Bangladesh, leading industry manufacturers like the Airbus and Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group of Canada, higher educational institutions like Dhaka University, Cranfield University and the University of Surrey in the UK and Shenyang Aerospace in China to name a few,’ he said.

He also said that eminent Indian space scientist and former chair of Indian Space Research Organisation Professor AS Kiran Kumar, pro-vice-chancellor of Cranfield University Professor Dame Helen Atkinson and Professor Nazmul Ula of Loyola Maryland University of the US conducted sessions in training events.

The university has already built an antenna and set it on a rooftop on its makeshift campus in Tejgoan to begin to explore space science.

‘It [the antenna] works as it can establish connection with satellites,’ said Nazrul Islam.

He said that they were getting good response from the non-resident Bangladeshi experts against a BSMRAAU request for taking classes at the university since consultancy fees of foreign experts are very high.

The university is also going to arrange training for its teachers at foreign universities as they are determined not to compromise on the quality of teaching and training.

He noted that compromising on quality would not help them in translating the dream of making the university as a centre of excellent in the county’s aviation industry and space science.

He spoke high of the government decision to develop the university into an important international entity in the field of aviation and space science and technology in fulfilling the national aspirations set on the occasion of the country’s 50 years of independence.

The vice-chancellor noted that the country’s aviation sector was growing as in many other parts around the world.

He, however, lamented that the sector was dependent mostly on foreigners, forcing the country to spend foreign currency on their services.

He said that they were preparing to shift the university campus to Lalmonirhat in July.

Initially, the undergraduate courses will be taken to the Lalmonirhat residential campus, facilitated by the Air Force, he added.

Nazrul Islam said that a development project proposal had already been submitted to the education ministry in connection with its permanent campus on the government allotted lands in the same city.

He said that he was overwhelmed by the willingness from students for admission to the university.

At present, the BSMRAAU has two batches of BSc in Aeronautical Engineering (Aerospace) and one batch of BSc in Aeronautical Engineering (Avionics) in the undergraduate programme.

The current graduate students of the university comprise two batches of MSc in Aviation Safety and Accident Investigation and MBA in Aviation Management and one batch of MSc in Aviation and Space Law.

From July 2022, the BSMRAAU will start offering MSc in Space System Engineering and MSc in Satellite Communication Engineering.

It has also a plan to offer MSc in Autonomous Systems Engineering, MSc in Aeronautical Engineering (Aerospace) and Aeronautical Engineering (Avionics) from the academic year 2022-23.

Nazrul Islam expected that the higher science degree seekers would give high priority to the university in future.

He also expected that the number of students would reach 300 in June 2022 and 700 by 2025.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/169039/bangladeshs-lone-aviation-univ-prioritises-research-development,2023-05-18 10:37:46,newagebd
1010,Bangladesh has bankable climate adaptation methods,"Patrick Verkooijen

Global Center on Adaptation chief executive officer Patrick Verkooijen has said that Bangladesh has put local people at the heart of climate change solutions and has already set bankable adaptation practices.

The climate adaptation expert came up with the remark while talking with New Age on Sunday as he was visiting Bangladesh.

Headquartered in Rotterdam and with regional offices in Africa, South Asia and the Asia Pacific, the GCA was founded in 2018 by the Netherlands.

The GCA engages in policy development, research, advocacy communications and provides technical assistance in the forms of fund and knowledge to governments, private sectors and local people in addressing impacts of climate change.

‘What solution is being implemented in Bangladesh will also be shared with the rest of the world — from Africa to Europe,’ said Verkooijen, who is playing an important role in shaping the future of adaptation actions in 48 countries most threatened by climate change in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

The Mongla Sample in Bangladesh, which investigates the feasibility of using monsoon rainwater for domestic purposes, including drinking, is already being replicated in many African countries, he noted.

‘Bangladesh is, quite frankly, champion in locally-led adaptation. What solution is being implemented in Bangladesh will also be shared with the rest of the world, he repeated.0

Verkooijen, also a former professor of practice of sustainable development diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, believes that a massive climate adaptation is happening in Bangladesh.

He, however, pointed out that though the country was doing a lot, but that was not enough in this stage of emergency, adding that more need to be done.

‘We are working to make a paradigm shift for Bangladesh — from vulnerability to prosperity, from victim to leading country in climate action,’ he said.

He appreciated Bangladesh for keeping a $1.2 billion fund annually from own resources, even being a climate change victim country, though, he added, the country needs $8.5 billion.

He said that the GCA was working to organise funds for climate work in Bangladesh and was helping the country as a solution broker.

The Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and other lenders and development partners have fund while the government has plans, he went on to explain, adding that the GCA will collaborate with them.

Lauding the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan of the government, Verkooijen said that it wanted to stand by Bangladesh in graduating from a climate vulnerable country to a prosperous nation.

He said that due to climate change people were migrating to cities, adding that Bangladesh needs to halt the migration to the existing crowded cities by developing migrant-friendly secondary cities with adequate services and livelihood opportunities.

The GCA, he noted, is working with the government of Bangladesh to build 22 such secondary cities, including one in Mongla, for people of the vulnerable areas to stop migration to the existing cities.

According to the GCA CEO, everything is adaptable but at some point economic costs are so high that the global community obviously must lower the carbon emission level so that it must not cross the 1.5C target threshold.

Observing that the process of accessing the climate fund is too complicated, he suggested that as there was no direct access to the fund the concern needed to be addressed.

He further suggested that if nations wanted to have an international solidarity on climate action, the broken promise of $100 billion a year should also be addressed.

But $100 billion is not enough at all, he hastened to add.

Criticising the nature of climate funding, he advised that adaptation should mainly be grant-based while mitigation should mostly depend on loans as there would be return on adaptation investments.

‘But victim countries are getting more as loan,’ he noted.

He went on to observe that climate funding should not come from the public sector alone, adding that the private sectors, too, can play a large role in this regard.

Bangladesh has an adaptation plan, but the challenge is to translate it into finance commitment, into action on the ground, he also observed.

He went on to point out that countries at the Sharm el-Sheikh Climate Change Conference agreed to provide fund for losses and damages but no money was coming accordingly.

Even if there is money for lost and damaged facilities, these cannot be built as they were with the fund promised, he said.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/196766/bangladesh-has-bankable-climate-adaptation-methods,2023-05-18 10:37:47,newagebd
1011,Bangladesh doesn’t have capacity for scientific fire probe yet: DG,"Brigadier General Md Sazzad Hussain

Fire Service and Civil Defence director general Brigadier General Md Sazzad Hussain said that no scientific investigation could be carried out into fire incidents in Bangladesh over the years.

Rather, he further said, the probe reports were prepared based on circumstantial evidence and witness accounts of the fire incidents while reports were supplied on demand.

‘As of now, we have neither the expertise for forensic investigations into fire incidents nor the facilities needed for the purpose,’ said the country’s chief fire fighting officer, adding, ‘The investigation we conduct is actually superficial.’

He said, ‘The reports prepared are not based on scientific evidence.’

He termed the absence of a fire forensic laboratory as a ‘grey area’ and the biggest weakness of the department.

In a recent interview with New Age at the FSCD headquarters, Brigadier General Sazzad also admitted that had the fire investigations been carried out scientifically, the actual reasons could have been identified.

However, he said, the main challenge to an investigation into any fire incident is that it destroys everything it engulfs and often it is very difficult to find any evidence at all.

‘That’s why we hardly comment on the source of origin on the spot, instead we prefer to comment after conducting an investigation,’ he said, adding that there has been a long-standing requisition for a fire forensic laboratory for the force.

He said that they were now working to set up a world-class training facility in Munshiganj with a fire forensic laboratory as part of the modernisation of the agency and to investigate fire incidents scientifically.

According to the fire service department, 21,073 fire incidents took place in 2020 while the figure was 24,074 in 2019.

The department’s manpower is expected to be 15,000 by the middle of 2022.

Currently, the department is in a recruitment process to enhance its existing manpower of 11,000 firefighters and staff.

The government wants to raise its manpower to 25,000 by 2030, Sazzad said.

The government is, he further said, also in the process of restructuring the department, with the United Nations Development Programme helping in the endeavour.

As he said, the weakest part of the department is its training facility.

The training centre it built long ago when the number of the members of the force was only 5,000.

‘It’s very difficult to train up our manpower with the existing facilities in Mirpur [in the capital],’ he added.

He said that the government had allocated 100 acres of land at Gazaria in Munshiganj to build a full-fledged training facility for both officers and rankers with international standard firefighting and rescue training.

The land acquisition process for the facility is under way while a technical team is scheduled to visit the site soon for carrying out a feasibility study of the project, he disclosed.

‘I have planned to equip the training facility in such a way that fire rescuers from Europe and America, too, would come to it for training,’ he said.

Sazzad said that as the project was now in its preparatory stage, they would look for foreign partnership to build the facility.

‘If we do not find any foreign assistance, we will build it with our own fund,’ he added.

During the interview, Sazzad detailed the process of modernisation of the force, being implemented for over a decade, under which latest fire engines and other equipment were procured and fire stations were built at all upazila headquarters.

The FSCD chief said that an initiative had started for major development of the department since 2009 when the Awami League assumed power, with major activities undertaken and manpower recruited under the initiative.

Apart from the infrastructural development, he said, the department is now focusing on building physical fitness and professional capacity of the firefighters.

The force has also procured a lot of fire engines and equipment under government-to-government procurement deals to fight fire in industrial areas and at growing numbers of high-rises, he mentioned.

‘Look, he said, any fire becomes devastating in the first 10 minutes,’ adding, ‘Our standard response time to a fire is, therefore, about 10 minutes.’

If a fire can’t be controlled in the first 10 minutes, it might get devastating, he added.

Both fire safety measures and the building code should be complied with in order to keep casualties in a fire incident low, he said.

According to the FSCD chief, one of the major challenges during a firefighting operation is the scarcity of space for setting up fire engines.

Besides, he said, firefighters face shortage of water supply in Dhaka and other major cities.

In the case of fire at the Hashem Food factory in Narayanganj, which killed 54 workers in July, firefighters had to wait several hours just for placing their turntable ladders and then there was a shortage of water supply, he noted.

Also, the crowd hampered the firefighting job, he added.

The FSCD has 25 turntable ladders.

He said that the disaster management and relief ministry was procuring 12 more turntable ladders at a cost of Tk 150 crore.

By June, the fire service would have 35 turntable ladders so that the divisional headquarters would also be equipped with an advanced firefighting system in the coming years, he further said.

The old part of Dhaka city badly needs more fire hydrants, he mentioned, adding that water reservoirs should be available for multi-storey buildings.

During firefighting operations, he noted, firefighters also face difficulty managing crowds.

In many cases, overenthusiastic people hamper firefighting efforts, he added.

Brigadier General Sazzad said that the department was currently focusing on awareness building with students in focus.

He said that they were also preparing publications, using which people would be aware of how to deal with any fire situation.

The government is also raising community volunteers to help fight fire, he said.

In the event of high-rise fire incidents, the fire official said, instead of using turntable ladders the force is giving emphasis on inbuilt firefighting equipment at such buildings.

About using helicopters, he said that choppers were basically used to douse wildfires but in the context of Bangladesh it was more important to equip buildings with the smart fire-protection system.

‘We will go for helicopters when the rest of our listed equipment is purchased. It’s not priority,’ he said.

Regarding the long-standing demand for the deployment of firefighters in the UN peacekeeping missions, he said that the government sent troops based on the requirement placed by the UN.",,https://www.newagebd.net/article/159487/bangladesh-doesnt-have-capacity-for-scientific-fire-probe-yet-dg,2023-05-18 10:37:48,newagebd

1016,Is Bangladesh getting entangled in game?,"THE prime minister’s statement that Bangladesh will not purchase anything from countries that would impose sanctions took many by surprise because no western country has yet so done. The only sanctions imposed by the west on Bangladesh so far have been those by the United States on the Rapid Action Battalion and senior battalion and police officials for ‘serious human rights violations.’

The prime minister’s statement suggests that she would, perhaps, ignore the US-west’s call for a free and fair election and hold it her way and, therefore, apprehensive of their economic sanctions. There is a bipartisan belief in Bangladesh that the United States and western countries will impose economic sanctions if the Awami League chose to hold elections similar to the 2014 and 2018 elections to remain in power.

The prime minister’s statement is, nevertheless, intriguing because Bangladesh’s economic relations with the United States and the west are extremely asymmetrical. The United States, for instance, has the undeniable power and might to make Bangladesh regret if it pushes Washington towards economic sanctions and retaliates the way the prime minister promised.

Sea changes have occurred in the strategic contexts of Bangladesh’s regional and world politics since the end of the US-led war on terror in August 2021. The US-west was focused on fighting Islamic fundamentalism and Islamic terrorism as issues of utmost strategic importance to them leading to Bangladesh’s controversial elections in 2014 and 2018. They did not want the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to gain power through these two elections because of its alliance with Jamaat. They, thus, looked the other way and allowed the Awami League its second and third terms.

Islamic fundamentalism and Islamic terrorism are no longer indispensable strategic issues of the United States and the west. They have now embraced democracy and human rights as indispensable, instead. These issues have already brought good results for the Democratic Party in the US mid-term elections in 2022. President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party will use these issues again in the US presidential election in 2024.

The Biden administration pursued these issues in Bangladesh as part of its concerns worldwide since it came to power in January 2021 as its foreign and domestic policy goals. It imposed sanctions on the Rapid Action Battalion in pursuit of democracy and human rights. It excluded Bangladesh from Biden’s 110-nation first and second Democracy Summits held in December 2021 and March 2023, thus placing Bangladesh with pariah nations such as Myanmar and North Korea, again for the same reasons.

Most strategic analysts in Bangladesh unfortunately have not seriously focused on these geopolitical developments and realities and their impact on Bangladesh. Many of them felt that the United States and its western allies with India as a key player would give the Awami League a fourth consecutive term to fight China and bring the Indo-Pacific nations together under US-led forums such as the Quad and the Indo-Pacific Strategy against China.

These Bangladeshi analysts have, thus, been in denial about the US call for a free and fair general election in Bangladesh in 2024 that started from the time US ambassador Peter Haas presented his credentials in March 2022. Ambassador Haas’s call was taken up by all the western countries and the United States in Dhaka like a chorus. Yet, anxiety lingered in the minds of these Bangladeshi analysts that the United States encouraged by India was not serious about a free and fair election in Bangladesh.

The prime minister said before leaving for her recent three-nation trip that she would explain to the US leaders the ‘model election’ of her government to meet the US expectations. She was in Washington for five days and, yet, she was unable to meet anyone from the Biden administration which is unprecedented in Bangladesh-US bilateral relations. There was, of course, no reason for them to meet her because before embarking on her visit, she stated in the parliament that Washington was working to change her regime.

The Washington trip and the prime minister’s statement on sanctions, however, flagged the US seriousness for a free and fair general election in Bangladesh. Nevertheless, some of those who doubted the United States all along continue to feel that Washington would eventually come behind the Awami League for a military base in the Bay of Bengal. They believe that the Matarbari deep seaport that some called ‘the game changer’ would eventually become a US military base.

Those who hold this view do so without considering, first, China’s present power and position in the region and the world and, second, the US disinclination to come into a direct conflict with China in the region that a US military base in the bay would certainly lead to. The Chinese ambassador in Dhaka Yao Wen made a milestone address recently at a seminar titled ‘Bangladesh-China Relations: Prognosis for the Future’ which is very important in this context.

Ambassador Wen stated in his presentation clearly that Bangladesh-China relations are ideal, devoid of any tension. He mentioned China’s proactive involvement in Bangladesh’s economic development and further stated that Beijing and Dhaka are currently engaged in discussions for Chinese investments in several strategic projects to underline the strength of Bangladesh-China relations. Wen also underlined China’s focus on anti-China US activities in the region and China’s determination to deal with them. He left no doubt that China would not favour any country in the region should it get involved in these US-led initiatives.

The United States has, meanwhile, also not overtly expressed any intention that it is either seeking to get involved with China militarily or seeking a military base in the bay. The United States is, to the contrary, instead advocating through the Indo-Pacific Strategy ‘a free, open, connected, prosperous, resilient, and secure Indo-Pacific region’ that surprisingly is no different from China’s Belt and Road Initiative with economic connectivity among nations the key element in both. Further, the domestic opinion in the United States, with the country entering its presidential election cycle, is not in favour of war but peace, no doubt as the result of the country’s bad experience from its war on terror.

Therefore, notwithstanding the views of some, the big powers with the ability to influence Bangladesh’s politics, are in no hurry to turn it into a zone of conflict with India’s intention unfortunately not being clear. Japan stated categorically through Iwama Kiminori, its ambassador in Dhaka, that its relations with Bangladesh are economic. Japan has invested in the Matarbari deep-sea project and other projects in Bangladesh hugely. It is aware that its investment would be in jeopardy if China feels that the Matarbari project may eventually become a US military base.

The proponents of the Matarbari project, therefore, have to be cautious and knowledgeable about strategic affairs. Otherwise, Matarbari could push the country towards strategic games of the big powers. They should also consider that Bangladesh could be well served by more investments in its two existing seaports without the Matarbari and that the promise of making Bangladesh the regional economic hub is based on its potential to serve the Seven Sisters, Nepal and Bhutan.

The promise of a hub should ring a bell in the proponents of Matarbari that New Delhi promised in the Awami League’s 2009–2014 term to make Bangladesh the regional connectivity hub with fabulous financial benefits if it gave India land transit which was Bangladesh’s only negotiating card for claiming its critical river water rights from India. Bangladesh is still waiting to become the connectivity hub. The fabulous riches have not reached its coffers. India has still not signed the Teesta deal. Dhaka has, meanwhile, granted India the use of Chattogram and Mangla ports. New Delhi, alas, talks no more of water sharing!

Bangladesh should, therefore, tread with caution about Matarbari which will be operational in 2026. It should develop Matarbari for use by Bangladesh only keeping in perspectives the strategic concerns and the track record of Indian promises. Bangladesh should develop Matarbari also as a negotiating card for its water-sharing rights from India and not play this card away on the vague promise of becoming the regional economic hub.

Bangladesh’s economic future is squarely in the Awami League’s hands now. If it ignores the US and the west’s call for a free and fair general election and brings on Bangladesh the economic sanctions that the prime minister fears, Bangladesh’s economy would be devastated. A free and fair general election should, therefore, be the prayer of every Bangladeshi.

1017,11 hijackers were CIA recruits,"— Wikipedia

At least two 9/11 hijackers had been recruited into a joint CIA-Saudi intelligence operation that was covered up at the highest level, according to an explosive new court filing, writes Kit Klarenberg

A NEWLY-RELEASED court filing raises grave questions about the relationship between Alec Station, a CIA unit set up to track Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden and his associates, and two 9/11 hijackers leading up to the attacks, which was subject to a coverup at the highest levels of the FBI.

Obtained by SpyTalk, the filing is a 21-page declaration by Don Canestraro, a lead investigator for the Office of Military Commissions, the legal body overseeing the cases of 9/11 defendants. It summarises classified government discovery disclosures, and private interviews he conducted with anonymous high-ranking CIA and FBI officials. Many agents who spoke to Canestraro headed up Operation Encore, the Bureau’s aborted, long-running probe into Saudi government connections to the 9/11 attack.

Despite conducting multiple lengthy interviews with a range of witnesses, producing hundreds of pages of evidence, formally investigating several Saudi officials, and launching a grand jury to probe a Riyadh-run US-based support network for the hijackers, Encore was abruptly terminated in 2016. This was purportedly due to a byzantine intra-FBI bust-up over investigative methods.

When originally released in 2021 on the Office’s public court docket, every part of the document was redacted except an ‘unclassified’ marking. Given its explosive contents, it is not difficult to see why: as Canestraro’s investigation concluded, at least two 9/11 hijackers had been recruited either knowingly or unknowingly into a joint CIA-Saudi intelligence operation which may have gone awry.

‘A 50/50 chance’ of Saudi involvement

IN 1996, Alec Station was created under the watch of the CIA. The initiative was supposed to comprise a joint investigative effort with the FBI. However, FBI operatives assigned to the unit soon found they were prohibited from passing any information to the Bureau’s head office without the CIA’s authorisation, and faced harsh penalties for doing so. Efforts to share information with the FBI’s equivalent unit — the I-49 squad based in New York — were repeatedly blocked.

In late 1999, with ‘the system blinking red’ about an imminent large-scale Al Qaeda terror attack inside the US, the CIA and NSA were closely monitoring an ‘operational cadre’ within an Al Qaeda cell that included the Saudi nationals Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar. The pair would purportedly go on to hijack American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11.

Al-Hazmi and al-Midhar had attended an Al Qaeda summit that took place between January 5 and 8 2000, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The meeting was secretly photographed and videotaped by local authorities at Alec Station’s request although, apparently, no audio was captured. En route, Mihdhar transited through Dubai, where CIA operatives broke into his hotel room and photocopied his passport. It showed that he possessed a multi-entry visa to the US.

A contemporaneous internal CIA cable stated this information was immediately passed to the FBI ‘for further investigation.’ In reality, Alec Station not only failed to inform the Bureau of Mihdhar’s US visa, but also expressly forbade two FBI agents assigned to the unit from doing so.

‘[I said] ‘we’ve got to tell the Bureau about this. These guys clearly are bad… we’ve got to tell the FBI.’ And then [the CIA] said to me, ‘no, it’s not the FBI’s case, not the FBI’s jurisdiction’,’ Mark Rossini, one of the FBI agents in question, has alleged. ‘If we had picked up the phone and called the Bureau, I would’ve been violating the law. I…would’ve been removed from the building that day. I would’ve had my clearances suspended, and I would be gone.’

On January 15, Hazmi and Mihdhar entered the US through Los Angeles International Airport, just weeks after the foiled Millennium plot. Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi government ‘ghost employee’ immediately met them at an airport restaurant. After a brief conversation, Bayoumi helped them find an apartment near his own in San Diego, co-signed their lease, set them up bank accounts, and gifted $1,500 towards their rent. The three would have multiple contacts moving forward.

In interviews with Operation Encore investigators years later, Bayoumi alleged his run-in with the two would-be hijackers was mere happenstance. His extraordinary practical and financial support was, he claimed, simply charitable, motivated by sympathy for the pair, who could barely speak English and were unfamiliar with Western culture.

The Bureau disagreed, concluding Bayoumi was a Saudi spy, who handled a number of Al Qaeda operatives in the US. They also considered there to be a ‘50/50 chance’ he — and by extension Riyadh — had detailed advance knowledge of the 9/11 attacks.

That remarkable finding wasn’t known publicly until two decades later, when a tranche of Operation Encore documents were declassified upon the Biden administration’s orders, and it was completely ignored by the mainstream media. Don Canestraro’s declaration now reveals FBI investigators went even further in their assessments.

A Bureau special agent, dubbed ‘CS-3’ in the document, stated Bayoumi’s contact with the hijackers and support thereafter ‘was done at the behest of the CIA through the Saudi intelligence service.’ Alec Station’s explicit purpose was to ‘recruit Al-Hazmi and Al-Mihdhar via a liaison relationship’, with the assistance of Riyadh’s General Intelligence Directorate.

A most ‘unusual’ CIA unit

ALEC Station’s formal remit was to track bin Laden, ‘collect intelligence on him, run operations against him, disrupt his finances, and warn policymakers about his activities and intentions.’ These activities would naturally entail enlisting informants within Al Qaeda.

Nonetheless, as several high level sources told Canestraro, it was extremely ‘unusual’ for such an entity to be involved in gathering intelligence and recruiting assets. The US-based unit was run by CIA analysts, who do not typically manage human assets. Legally, that work is the exclusive preserve of case officers ‘trained in covert operations’ and based overseas.

‘CS-10’, a CIA case officer within Alec Station, concurred with the proposition that Hazmi and Mihdhar enjoyed a relationship with the CIA through Bayoumi, and was baffled that the unit was tasked with attempting to penetrate Al Qaeda in the first place. They felt it ‘would be nearly impossible…to develop informants inside’ the group, given the ‘virtual’ station was based in a Langley basement, ‘several thousand miles from the countries where Al Qaeda was suspected of operating.’

‘CS-10’ further testified that they ‘observed other unusual activities’ at Alec Station. Analysts within the unit ‘would direct operations to case officers in the field by sending the officers cables instructing them to do a specific tasking,’ which was ‘a violation of CIA procedures.’ Analysts ‘normally lacked the authority to direct a case officer to do anything.’

‘CS-11’, a CIA operations specialist posted to Alec Station ‘sometime prior to the 9/11 attacks’ said they likewise ‘observed activity that appeared to be outside normal CIA procedures.’ Analysts within the unit ‘mostly stuck to themselves and did not interact frequently’ with others. When communicating with one another through internal cables, they also used operational pseudonyms, which ‘CS-11’ described as peculiar, as they were not working undercover, ‘and their employment with the CIA was not classified information.’

The unit’s unusual operational culture may explain some of the stranger decisions made during this period vis a vis Al Qaeda informants. In early 1998, while on a CIA mission to penetrate London’s Islamist scene, a joint FBI-CIA informant named Aukai Collins received a stunning offer: bin Laden himself wanted him to go to Afghanistan so they could meet.

Collins relayed the request to his superiors. While the FBI was in favour of infiltrating Al Qaeda’s base, his CIA handler nixed the idea, saying, ‘there was no way the US would approve an American operative going undercover into Bin Laden’s camps.’

Similarly, in June 2001, CIA and FBI analysts from Alec Station met with senior Bureau officials, including representatives of its own Al Qaeda unit. The CIA shared three photos of individuals who attended the Kuala Lumpur meeting 18 months earlier, including Hazmi and Mihdhar. However, as an FBI counter-terror officer codenamed ‘CS-15’ recalled, the dates of the photos and key details about the figures they depicted were not revealed. Instead, the analysts simply asked if the FBI ‘knew the identities of the individuals in the photos.’

Another FBI official present, ‘CS-12’, offers an even more damning account. The Alec Station analysts not only failed to offer biographical information, but falsely implied one of the individuals might be Fahd Al-Quso, a suspect in the bombing of the USS Cole. What’s more, they outright refused to answer any questions related to the photographs. Nonetheless, it was confirmed that no system was in place to alert the FBI if any of the three entered the US — a ‘standard investigative technique’ for terror suspects.

Given Hazmi and Mihdhar appeared to be simultaneously working for Alec Station in some capacity, the June 2001 meeting may well have been a dangle. No intelligence value could be extracted from inquiring whether the Bureau knew who their assets were, apart from ascertaining if the FBI’s counter-terror team was aware of their identities, physical appearances, and presence in the US.

Quite some coverup

ANOTHER of Canestraro’s sources, a former FBI agent who went by ‘CS-23,’ testified that after 9/11, FBI headquarters and its San Diego field office quickly learned of ‘Bayoumi’s affiliation with Saudi intelligence and subsequently the existence of the CIA’s operation to recruit’ Hazmi and Mihdhar.

However, ‘senior FBI officials suppressed investigations’ into these matters. ‘CS-23’ alleged, furthermore, that Bureau agents testifying before the Joint Inquiry into 9/11 ‘were instructed not to reveal the full extent of Saudi involvement with Al-Qaeda.’

The US intelligence community would have had every reason to shield Riyadh from scrutiny and consequences for its role in the 9/11 attacks, as it was then one of its closest allies. But the FBI’s eager complicity in Alec Station’s coverup may have been motivated by self-interest, as one of its own was intimately involved in the unit’s effort to recruit Hazmi and Mihdhar, and conceal their presence in the US from relevant authorities.

‘CS-12’, who attended the June 2001 meeting with Alec Station, told Canestraro that they ‘continued to press FBI Headquarters for further information regarding the subjects in the photographs’ over that summer. On August 23rd, they stumbled upon an ‘electronic communication’ from FBI headquarters, which identified Hazmi and Mihdhar, and noted they were in the US.

‘CS-12’ then contacted the FBI analyst within Alec Station who authored the communication. The conversation quickly became ‘heated’, with the analyst ordering them to delete the memo ‘immediately’ as they were not authorised to view it. While unnamed in the declaration, the FBI analyst in question was Dina Corsi.

The next day, on a conference call between ‘CS-12’, Corsi, and the FBI’s bin Laden unit chief, ‘officials at FBI headquarters’ explicitly told ‘CS-12’ to ‘stand down’ and ‘cease looking’ for Mihdhar, as the Bureau intended to open an ‘intelligence gathering investigation’ on him. The next day, ‘CS-12’ emailed Corsi, stating bluntly ‘someone is going to die’ unless Mihdhar was pursued criminally.

It was surely no coincidence that two days later, on August 26, Alec Station finally informed the FBI that Hazmi and Mihdhar were in the US. By then, the pair had entered the final phase of preparations for the impending attacks. If a criminal probe had been opened, they could have been stopped in their tracks. Instead, as foreshadowed by the officials in contact with ‘CS-12,’ an intelligence investigation was launched which hindered any search efforts.

In the days immediately after the 9/11 attacks, ‘CS-12’ and other New York-based FBI agents participated in another conference call with Bureau headquarters. During the conversation, they learned Hazmi and Mihdhar were named on Flight 77’s manifest. One analyst on the line ran the pair’s names through ‘commercial databases,’ quickly finding them and their home address listed in San Diego’s local phone directory. It turned out they had been living with an FBI informant.

‘CS-12’ soon contacted Corsi ‘regarding information on the hijackers.’ She responded by providing a photograph from the same surveillance operation that produced the three pictures presented at the June 2001 meeting between Alec Station and FBI agents; they depicted Walid bin Attash, a lead suspect in Al Qaeda’s 1998 East Africa US Embassy bombings and its attack on the USS Cole.

Corsi was unable to explain why the photo was not shown to FBI agents earlier. If it had been, ‘CS-12’ claims they would have ‘immediately linked’ Hazmi and Mihdhar to bin Attash, which ‘would have shifted from an intelligence based investigation into a criminal investigation.’ The FBI’s New York field office could have then devoted its ‘full resources’ to finding the hijackers before the fateful day of September 11, 2001.

Alec Station operatives fail upwards

ALEC Station’s tireless efforts to protect its Al Qaeda assets raises the obvious question of whether Hazmi and Mihdhar, and possibly other hijackers, were in effect working for the CIA on the day of 9/11.

The real motives behind the CIA’s stonewalling may never be known. But it appears abundantly clear that Alec Station did not want the FBI to know about or interfere in its secret intelligence operation. If the unit’s recruitment of Hazmi and Mihdhar was purely dedicated to information gathering, rather than operational direction, it is incomprehensible that the FBI had not been apprised of it, and was instead actively misdirected.

Several FBI sources consulted by Canestraro speculated that the CIA’s desperation to penetrate Al Qaeda prompted it to grant Alec Station the power to recruit assets, and pressured it to do so. But if this were truly the case, then why did Langley refuse the opportunity to send Aukai Collins — a proven deep cover asset who had infiltrated several Islamist gangs — to penetrate bin Laden’s network in Afghanistan?

One alternative explanation is that Alec Station, a powerful rogue CIA team answerable and accountable to no one, sought to infiltrate the terror group for its own sinister purposes, without the authorisation and oversight usually required by Langley in such circumstances. Given that Collins was a joint asset shared with the FBI, he could not be trusted to participate in such a sensitive black operation.

No member of Alec Station has been punished in any way for the supposed ‘intelligence failures’ that allowed 9/11 to go ahead. In fact, they have been rewarded. Richard Blee, the unit’s chief at the time of the attacks, and his successor Alfreda Frances Bikowsky, both joined the CIA’s operations division, and became highly influential figures in the so-called war on terror. Corsi, for her part, was promoted at the FBI, eventually rising to the rank of deputy assistant director for Intelligence.

In a perverse twist, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s report on the CIA’s torture programme found that Bikowsky had been a key player in the agency’s black site machinations, and one of their chief public apologists. It is increasingly clear that the programme was specifically concerned with eliciting false testimony from suspects in order to justify and expand the US war on terror.

The public’s understanding of the 9/11 attacks is heavily informed by testimonies delivered by CIA torture victims under the most extreme duress imaginable. And Bikowsky, a veteran of the Alec Station that ran cover for at least two would-be 9/11 hijackers, had been in charge of interrogating the alleged perpetrators of the attacks.

The veteran FBI deep cover agent Aukai Collins concluded his memoir with a chilling reflection which was only reinforced by Don Canestraro’s bombshell declaration:

‘I was very mistrustful about the fact that bin Laden’s name was mentioned literally hours after the attack… I became very skeptical about anything anybody said about what happened, or who did it. I thought back to when I was still working for them and we had the opportunity to enter Bin Laden’s camp. Something just hadn’t smelled right…To this day I’m unsure who was behind September 11, nor can I even guess… Someday the truth will reveal itself, and I have a feeling that people won’t like what they hear.’

1018,Dangerous alliance of Rothschild and Vatican of Francis,"HOLY Moly! The most globalist and interventionist Pope since the Crusades of the 12th century has formalised an alliance with the largest figures in global finance led by none other than that noble banking family, Rothschild. The new alliance is a joint venture they call ‘Council for Inclusive Capitalism with the Vatican.’ The venture is one of the more cynical and given the actors, most dangerous frauds being promoted since Davos WEF guru and Henry Kissinger protégé, Klaus Schwab, began to promote the great reset of the world capitalist order. What and is behind this so-called Council for Inclusive Capitalism with the Vatican?

On their website they proclaim in a typical UN doublespeak, ‘The Council for Inclusive Capitalism is a movement of the world’s business and public sector leaders who are working to build a more inclusive, sustainable, and trusted economic system that addresses the needs of our people and the planet.’ A more sustainable, trusted economic system? Doesn’t that sound like the infamous UN Agenda 21 and its Agenda 2030 daughter, the globalist master plan? They then claim, ‘Inclusive capitalism is fundamentally about creating long-term value for all stakeholders — businesses, investors, employees, customers, governments and communities.’

They continue, ‘Council members make actionable commitments aligned with the World Economic Forum International Business Council’s pillars for sustainable value creation — people, planet, principles of governance, and prosperity — and that advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.’

In announcing the deal with the Vatican, Lynn Forester de Rothschild declared, ‘This council will follow the warning from Pope Francis to listen to “the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor” and answer society’s demands for a more equitable and sustainable model of growth.’

Their reference to Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum is no accident. The group is yet another front group in what is becoming a globalist bum’s rush to try to convince a sceptical world that the same people who created the post-1945 model of IMF-led globalisation and giga-corporate entities more powerful than governments, destroying traditional agriculture in favour of toxic agribusiness, dismantling living standards in industrialised countries to flee to cheap labour countries like Mexico or China, will now lead the effort to correct all their abuses? We are being naïve if we swallow this.

Rothschild and pals

FIRST off it is useful to see who are the ‘inclusive’ capitalists joining forces with the Pope and Vatican. The founder is a lady who carries the name Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild. She is the wife of the 90-year old retired mega-billionaire head of London’s NM Rothschilds Bank, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild. Lady Lynn however is from ‘commoner’ roots, born into a US working class family in New Jersey whose father, as she tells, worked two jobs to put her and her brothers through law and medical schools. She seemed to have had some influential mentors, as she went to Wall Street then to telecoms including Motorola and made reported tens of millions before hooking up with Sir Evelyn and his reported $20 billion in assets. Reports have it that Henry Kissinger played a personal role in encouraging the Transatlantic union of the two.

Lady Lynn is interesting as well beyond her famous husband. According to the list of names of those who flew on the private jet of convicted child sex trafficker and reported Mossad operative Jeffrey Epstein, one name that appears is ‘de Rothschild, Lynn Forester.’

It is interesting to note, that the same Lynn Forester in 1991, before she took Sir Evelyn as her husband, generously let a British friend have full use of one of Lynn’s Manhattan apartment properties, following the apparent murder of the woman’s father, British media tycoon and Mossad agent, Robert Maxwell. The British friend of Lynn, Ghislaine Maxwell, today is awaiting trial for complicity in child sex trafficking as the partner of Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell reportedly maintained the Manhattan address of Lady Lynn until very recently to register a bizarre non-profit called Terramar that she and Epstein set up in 2012, allegedly aimed at saving our oceans. When Epstein was arrested she quickly dissolved the non-profit. One of the donors to Ghislaine’s TerraMar was something called the Clinton Foundation, which leads to the next friend.

Lady Lynn has another long-time friend named Hillary Clinton, whose husband, Bill, was also logged on Epstein’s Lolita Express private jet, around two dozen times. Lynn and her new husband, Sir Evelyn, in fact were so close to the Clintons that in 2000 the Rothschild newlyweds spent part of their honeymoon as guests at the White House of the Clintons. Lady Lynn after that became a major fund-raiser in 2008 and again 2016 for a possible Hillary bid for president, called a ‘bundler.’ She also advised Hillary on her economic programme, a free market one based on Adam Smith as she described it in an interview once.

Lady Lynn’s ‘guardians’

THE Rothschild venture with the Vatican at this point, in addition to co-founder Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, includes hand-picked money moguls and their select foundations who pompously call themselves the ‘guardians.’ That’s a term sounding more like a south side Chicago gang or some kind of mafia overlords. They call themselves the moral guardians, together now with their new friends at the Vatican, for reform of capitalism.

The guardian member list includes Rajiv Shah, the chief executive officer of the Rockefeller Foundation, and former partner of the Gates Foundation’s AGRA scam to introduce Genetically Modified Organism seeds in Africa. The Rockefeller Foundation has been involved in promoting a pandemic ‘lockdown’ since 2010, and is a core part of the WEF great reset agenda. He just released a Rockefeller report, ‘Reset the Table: Meeting the Moment to Transform the US Food System’.

Rothschild’s guardians also include Darren Walker, the chief executive officer of the Ford Foundation. Those two foundations, Ford and Rockefeller, have done more to shape an imperial American foreign policy than even the US state department or the Central Intelligence Agency, including the funding of the failed Green Revolution in India and Mexico, and the creation by Rockefeller funds of GMO crops.

The head of DuPont, a GMO giant and chemicals group is another guardian as well as scandal-ridden vaccine and drug companies, Merck and Johnson and Johnson. Merck lied about the risks of its arthritis drug Vioxx until more than 55,000 users died of heart attacks. Johnson and Johnson has been involved in numerous frauds in recent years including around negative effects of its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal, illegal presence of cancer-causing asbestos in its baby powder, and potentially thousands of legal actions for its role as a leading supplier of the opioid in Purdue Pharma’s deadly prescription painkiller OxyContin.

Other guardians include CEOs of Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Allianz insurance, BP. In 2016, Visa along with the United States Agency for International Development was behind the catastrophic Modi experiment to introduce a cashless economy in India.

Notable also is guardian Mark Carney, former Bank of England head and also advocate of cashless digital central bank currencies to replace the dollar. Carney is now United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance.

Carney is also a board member of the World Economic Forum, the public promoter of the global reset of capitalism to impose the dystopian Agenda 2030 ‘sustainable’ economy. In fact several of Rothschild’s guardians are on the WEF board, including billionaire Marc Benioff, founder of cloud computing Salesforce, and OECD head Angel Gurria. And ex-Credit Suisse CEO, Tidjane Thiam is on the International Business Council of the World Economic Forum.

Other guardians of the inclusive capitalism transformation include the head of Bank of America, which bank was sued by the US government for fraud connected with the 2008 US subprime mortgage crisis, as well as for laundering money for the deadly Mexican drug cartels and Russian organised crime. The select guardian list also includes Marcie Frost, the controversial head of CalPERS, the huge fraud-ridden California state pension fund managing over $360 billion.

The head of State Street Corporation, one of the world’s largest asset management companies with $3.1 trillion under management, is another guardian. In January 2020 State Street announced it would vote against directors of companies in major stock indices that do not meet targets for environmental, social and governance changes. This is what is called ‘green investing’, as part of so-called ‘socially responsible investing’. The WEF strategy, pushed also by WEF board members like Larry Fink of BlackRock, reward companies that they deem ‘socially responsible.’ This is the key to the inclusive capitalism agenda of not just Rothschild’s inclusive capitalism guardians, but also the WEF.

Their website claims that the guardians manage more than $10.5 trillion dollars and control companies that employ 200 million workers. Now a brief look at their new Vatican partner.

Vatican morals?

IRONICALLY, or maybe not, Pope Francis, the partner chosen to give Rothschild’s group of mega-capitalists ‘moral’ credibility, is himself embroiled in what could be the largest financial scandals, fraud and misuse of church funds in the modern history of the Vatican. This despite the fact Pope Francis declared as new Pope in 2013 that one of his main tasks would be to clean up the scandal-ridden Vatican finances. That has hardly taken place even after more than six years. Some Vatican observers even claim the financial corruption has worsened.

The unravelling scandal revolves around now-disgraced Cardinal Angelo Becciu who until 2018 was de facto chief of staff to the Pope and regular confidante. Becciu was Substitute for General Affairs in the Secretariat of State, a key position in the Roman Curia until June 2018 when the Pope elevated him to Cardinal, ironically enough, responsible for the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. Becciu, clearly no saint, was able to invest hundreds of millions, even billions, over years of church funds, including donations for the poor in Peter’s Pence, into projects he chose with a former banker from Credit Suisse. Projects included 150 million euro share in a luxury London real estate complex and $1.1 million into a film, Rocketman, about the life of Elton John. That comes to light as the ongoing Vatican child sex scandals caused Pope Francis to defrock Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington, the first Cardinal to fall in the church’s deep sexual abuse charges.

Italian press reports that the Pope knew about the dubious investments of Becciu and even praised them before the depth of the scandals broke. In November 2020, Italian police raided the residence of Becciu’s former Vatican accountant and found 600,000 euros in cash and evidence the Vatican employee received $15 million in fake invoicing over years.

With a background like this, the new Council for Inclusive Capitalism with the Vatican of Lynn de Rothschild warrants close scrutiny as they clearly plan big things along with Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum to ‘reform’ the world economy, and it won’t be nice or moral we can be sure.

1019,"Children’s rights to education, protection","— The World Bank

The practice of child labor is prevalent with about 50 per cent of primary students dropping out before they complete Class V. The total working child population aged 5-17 years are estimated at 7.9 million, writes Rayhan Ahmed Topader

EDUCATION is a basic human right and is important for everyone to make the most of their life. Having an education helps people to access all of their other human rights. Education improves an individual’s chances in life and helps to tackle poverty. Education is intrinsically valuable as the most effective tool for personal empowerment. Education takes on the status of a human right because it is integral to and enhances human dignity through the fruits of knowledge, wisdom and understanding.

For instrumental reasons, education has, moreover, the status of a multi-faceted social, economic and cultural human right. It is a social right because in the context of the community, it promotes the full development of human personality. It is an economic right because it facilitates economic self-sufficiency through employment or self-employment. It is a cultural right because the international community has directed education towards the building of a universal culture of human rights. In short, education is the requisite for the individual to function fully as a human being in modern society.

According to the most recent figures available with the UNESCO Institute for Statistics in July 2016, 263 million children and youth are out of school. This includes 61 million children who should be in primary school, 60 million in lower secondary school and 142 million aged 15–17 years. Girls and children from the sub-Saharan Africa are most likely to be missing out on their education. Armed conflict affects the primary schooling of 22 million children. Conflicts and emergencies directly affect 75 million children and adolescents.

Education reduces poverty, decreases social inequality, empowers women and helps each individual to reach their full potential. It also brings significant economic returns and helps societies to achieve lasting peace and sustainable development. Governments must, therefore, provide quality education and make sure that all children can access it, without discrimination.

This is an international legal obligation and governments can be held accountable for failing to provide education for all its citizens. There is a constitutional guarantee for education under Article 17 of the constitution of Bangladesh. The constitutional provision lays out that the government takes positive measure for send all children to educational institutions.

Children are assets to every society. They are regarded as the future architects of a nation. Sometimes, children are exposed to dirt, physical abuse, exploitation and other situational hazards. In Bangladesh, with a population of about 170 million, about a half are under the age of 18 and considered children and more than 20 million of them are under the age of five. The children have basic rights to education, balance diet, health and nutrition, protection, participation, recreation, safe water, sanitation, and hygiene. Many of the children are deprived of those basic rights and abused sexually and physically. Street children are victims of verbal, physical and sexual abuse from the police, gangsters and the general public.

Children in Bangladesh undergo different forms of violence and negligence in public and private establishments as well as in their family. In schools, for example, teachers often mistreat their students. Even sometimes, the police torture many children in their custody. We are developing our country but we still have to wait to see the bodies of children. Children are also vulnerable to being trafficked as bonded labourers or into brothels. Corporal punishment and degrading treatments are the norm because they are allowed by society.

Such violence has become a common picture. In a country where less than 10 per cent of children are registered at birth, it is difficult to track whether children’s rights are protected. Those who are abused, trafficked or exploited are explicitly denied their rights to be safe from such practices under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

The practice of child labor is prevalent with about 50 per cent of primary students dropping out before they complete Class V. The total working child population aged 5–17 years are estimated at 7.9 million. A total of 1.3 million children are estimated to be working for 43 hours or more a week. The United Nations adopted Convention on the Rights of the Child to uphold the right of child and the convention came into force September 1990 and Bangladesh has ratified the convention.

The convention lays out that every child is entitled to all the rights and freedom set forth therein, without distinction of any kind. The government as well as the state has failed to fulfill the constitutional commitment to establishing the right of the child. The commission that the National Human Right Commission Act 2009 has set up is silent about establishing the right of the child, There is no sufficient number of specialised hospitals for treatment of child.

Full logistic support should be given from the state for the children to continue with education to the higher secondary level. The state should make the arrangement of transport facilities and the state should supply children with educational equipment. The need to extend particular care to the child began in the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child in 1924 and in the declaration.

The children are helpless. Most of them are deprived of love and affection which are essential for their mental growth. As they are future citizens, so each of the entities should be careful about upholding the right of the child in family, in society and in the country. The international community knows that achieving the full extent of the right to education will take time and resources. Governments must have plans to meet the minimum standard of free, compulsory primary education and take steps to ensure the right to education for every child. The right to education without discrimination is part of the minimum standard and must be created immediately.

1023,Boeing wants Bangladesh not to purchase Airbus aircraft,"The US aeroplane manufacturer Boeing in a press conference in Dhaka on Wednesday recalled its 50 years of partnership with Bangladesh and said that it was looking for more engagement in the days to come.

David Schulte, a managing director for marketing for Asia Pacific and India at Boeing, and other senior executives attended the press conference as the Bangladesh government, in its election year, was considering a ‘techno-financial evaluation’ for a possible procurement of 10 aircraft from European aircraft manufacturer Airbus for the Boeing-dominated national flag carrier.

On May 5, the British and Bangladesh governments signed a non-binding ‘joint communiqué’ to proceed towards signing a memorandum of understanding in this regard.

Five days later, the Boeing delegation in a city hotel argued that the inclusion of Airbus aircraft in Biman’s fleet would require additional investment due to different types of spare parts, tooling, engine spares, spare engines, and pilot training requirements.

Schulte said that it would require two additional sets of pilots, crews, and engineers, among others, when an airline with a small fleet depended on multiple manufacturers.

Buying five 787s aircraft and five Airbus 350 Airbuses is a complex solution, and complex fleets cost more, he said.

He said that they were celebrating 50 years of collaboration as the Boeing 707 was inducted into the Biman fleet in 1972, and Boeing would celebrate in the next five years of Boeing 787 operations in Bangladesh.

Asked whether Boeing was losing its market share in Bangladesh, Schulte, without giving any specific answer, said that they were looking to engage more with Bangladesh in the days to come.

Pointing out that Biman Bangladesh Airlines has a small fleet of 21 aircraft, David said Biman could get a simple solution by introducing a common fleet of Boeing 787s.

He said that the aviation projection in Bangladesh depends on the existing annual economic growth of the country.

Biman now has 21 aircraft - four Boeing 777-300ERs, four Boeing 787-8s, two Boeing 787-9s, six Boeing 737-800s, and five De Havilland Canada DHC-8 Q400s.

Of the 21, Biman owns 18 aircraft, and five are operating on lease.

Kevin Yoo, a senior executive for international sales for Asia Pacific and India, said that they were also facilitating Bangladesh getting category one status in the United States to resume Dhaka-New York direct flights.

To meet strong demand for passenger travel and air cargo, Boeing anticipates South Asia’s carriers will need more than 2,300 new commercial aeroplanes over the next 20 years, more than tripling South Asia’s current in-service fleet of 700 aeroplanes.

‘We see tremendous opportunity in South Asia, with more than 80 per cent of new deliveries supporting air-travel growth and 20 per cent replacing older, less fuel-efficient aeroplanes,’ said Schulte.

Single-aisle aeroplanes like the Boeing 737 family would make up nearly 90 per cent of South Asia’s future fleet, while 10 per cent of the regional fleet would be wide-body aeroplanes like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

On May 5, Salman Fazlur Rahman, the prime minister’s private industry and investment adviser, said that Bangladesh’s relations with the UK, France, Germany, and the European Union would get a further boost with the initiative (of adding Airbus to the Biman fleet) and that the aviation industry of Bangladesh would be developed, according to a press statement.

Biman managing director and chief executive officer Shafiul Azim told New Age on Wednesday that Boeing held no meeting with them on this trip, though they have a long-term partnership.

Abdul Momen, who served as the Biman managing director between 2006 and 2009, told New Age that Biman should first evaluate the viability of such procurement as aircraft diversification might incur losses for a small fleet like Biman.",,http://www.newagebd.net/article/201404/boeing-wants-bangladesh-not-to-purchase-airbus-aircraft,2023-05-18 10:38:11,newagebd

1025,Potential cyclone Mocha heads for Cox’s Bazar,"Cyclone Mocha's forecasted movement and landfall. -- UNB Photo

The deep depression over the southeast Bay of Bengal was rapidly intensifying into a cyclone on Wednesday night, with the prediction of it making landfall as a severe storm between Cox’s Bazar and Myanmar on May 14.

At the time of moving onto land, forecasters said, the potential cyclone would be packed with wind blowing up to 130km an hour and extremely heavy rain, potentially causing landslides and tidal surges.

The hilly landscape of the cyclone’s potential landfall zone, home to roughly three million people, including a million Rohingya refugees living in shanties dotting the slopes of hillocks, is highly vulnerable to cyclone’s high winds and rain.

Unlike the south-western coast, the south-eastern district of Cox’s Bazar lacks the protection of the Sundarbans, a mangrove ecosystem that has proved crucial to minimising the impact of recent past cyclones.

Authorities sent volunteers request that those living on the hill slopes of the coastal district come down and take shelter elsewhere during the potential cyclone.

‘The impacts of the cyclone will be felt from May 13 afternoon,’ Ahmadul Haque, the chief of the Cyclone Preparedness Program, told New Age, sharing their plan of evacuating people as soon as the hoisting of signal number five.

Volunteers are already in action, warning people living on hill slopes in Cox’s Bazar town, Ukhia, Teknaf, and Ramu, he said, adding that cyclone shelters were also being prepared.

‘We are identifying structures capable of standing in 150km per hour winds in and nearby the Rohingya refugee camps for their evacuation,’ said Ahmadul Kabir.

The deep depression was 1,515km south of Chattogram port, 1,435 km south of Cox’s Bazar port, 1,510km south southeast of Mongla port, and 1,465km south of Payra port at 12:00pm, according to the Bangladesh Meteorological Department.

The BMD issued cautionary signal number one for the maritime ports and asked all fishing boats and trawlers to remain close to the shore and not venture into the deep sea until the dissipation of the potential cyclone.

‘The deep depression will become a cyclone at any moment,’ meteorologist Bazlur Rashid told New Age at 9:15pm.

The cyclone is named Mocha.

The potential cyclone will move today north-northwestward, intensifying into a very severe cyclonic storm over the southeast and adjoining central Bay of Bengal by midnight tomorrow, said the India Meteorological Department.

Then, the IMD said, the cyclone is likely to recurve and move north-northeastward on May 12 before slightly weakening on May 13 and crossing southeast Bangladesh and Myanmar between Cox’s Bazar and Kyaukpyu.

The cyclone will have many islands in its path, such as Saint Martin’s, Kutubdia, and Maheskhali, home to thousands of poor families living in houses made out of thatch or plastic at almost sea level.

The cyclone is also the last thing rice growers in southern Bangladesh expected now for they were harvesting or about to reap their boro crop.

United News of Bangladesh reported that the Department of Agriculture Extension asked farmers to harvest 80 per cent ripe paddy, mango, and other crops to avoid damage.

The news of the incoming cyclone shocked poor families living along coastal rivers exposed to the daily tide and ebb of the rivers as their protection embankments were breached long ago, reported New Age correspondent in Barishal.

‘We already lost our houses and agricultural land to river erosion. Now we have to deal with a cyclone,’ said Hasina Begum, a resident of Piprakakhali, Mirzaganj, and Patuakhali.

Long stretches of river protection embankments are missing in Barguna, Patharghata, and Patuakhali.

New Age correspondent in Chattogram reported that 90 shelters had been prepared to evacuate.

The state minister for disaster management and relief, Enamur Rahman, ordered all cyclone shelters in Chattogram and Cox’s Bazar to be prepared for evacuation, according to a press release.

About 200 tonnes of rice and Tk 20 lakh have been released for Chattogram and Cox’s Bazar districts to deal with cyclone impacts.

The BMD could not immediately recall the last time Cox’s Bazar battled a cyclone.

Independent studies on cyclones showed that the last time Cox’s Bazar was damaged by a cyclone was on May 20, 1998. It was a severe cyclone that hit with winds blowing up to 150 km an hour and a storm surge of 2.33 meters.

Chattogram, on the other hand, dealt with cyclone Mora on May 31, 2017. Mora killed 18 people and prompted the evacuation of half a million people.",,http://www.newagebd.net/article/201353/potential-cyclone-mocha-heads-for-coxs-bazar,2023-05-18 10:38:13,newagebd
1026,"A deep-sea port, an Indian transit, or a US military base?","DURING the Cold War, America strongly opposed the division of Pakistan because the Muslim-majority country was a valuable ally against the Soviet Union. After East Pakistan became Bangladesh with the help of India and the Soviet Union, the Nixon administration did not show support for the new country. They believed that Bangladesh was closely aligned with Indira Gandhi, who was pro-Soviet and disliked by secretary Henry Kissinger. In fact, Kissinger referred to Bangladesh as a ‘basket case’.

Following the violent removal of Mujib and his pro-Soviet regime in August 1975, the relationship between Dhaka and Washington shifted. The US became an active development partner of Bangladesh, while the World Bank, IMF, and various development agencies in the West had already implemented development projects in response to the devastating Famine of 1974. Throughout Bangladesh’s various elected and unelected regimes, Dhaka and Washington had a functional relationship until the Hasina regime, known for its corruption and autocratic practices, had faced disapproval from the World Bank and Washington for attempting to solicit kickbacks during the Padma bridge construction project in 2012. The situation caused Washington to experience cold shoulder syndrome.

For a period of time, until China emerged as a development and security partner of Bangladesh following the controversial parliamentary elections in 2018, Washington and Dhaka had a positive understanding. It’s widely believed these elections were rigged and sponsored by Beijing to keep Hasina in power. After the rigged polls of 2018, China became the primary overseer of Bangladesh’s infrastructure development projects, obviously to the discomfiture of America and its allies in the West and East, including Japan. For several years, China has been the primary source of military equipment for the country, which is worth mentioning.

Meanwhile, the growing tension between China and Taiwan, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and last but not least, China’s friendship with Russia and other adversaries of America have caused concern in Washington. It’s now important for the US to make a decisive decision about how to handle China, Russia, and their allies, such as Bangladesh. India’s relationship with Russia and its tense ties with China have mixed reactions in Washington. The US can’t openly support India’s relationship with Russia, but it also cannot afford to disengage from India, particularly in the event of a conflict with China.

Given the context, it appears that America is interested in establishing a military base in the Bay of Bengal, which is in close proximity to the strategically important Strait of Malacca, likely as a response to China’s actions. The unanswered question is whether Matarbari will serve as a transit for India and a military base for America! The agreement between Japan and Bangladesh to build a deep-sea port at Matarbari using Japanese funds and expertise was preceded by Sheikh Hasina’s recent statement in parliament on April 10. In her speech, she criticised the US for engaging in ‘regime change’ operations in Muslim-majority countries and accused them of being a nasty hegemonic power. Sheikh Hasina also mentioned that the Biden administration was annoyed by her refusal to grant the US a military base in the Bay of Bengal.

However, seemingly, Japan is acting as a ‘distant NATO member’ in the best interests of America, which consequently benefits India. However, Bangladesh may not benefit much from this arrangement and could potentially still be targeted by China if tensions escalate between China and America. The proposed deep-sea port in Bangladesh will not bring significant profits to the country either. Despite using Bangladeshi roads, railways, and rivers for transportation between Kolkata and Agartala, India’s transit fees are much lower than what experts predicted in 2010. Therefore, building another transit at Matarbari will not benefit Bangladesh financially. The country will also have to bear the expenses of maintaining the port and repaying the loan to Japan for its construction. This situation puts Bangladesh in a difficult and risky position.

To achieve success in Bangladesh, the US needs to negotiate with India. Recently, Derek Chollet, counsellor of the state department, travelled from Dhaka to Delhi to facilitate these negotiations. Japanese prime minister Kishida did the same thing. Recently, he went to Delhi to meet prime minister Modi days before Hasina’s state visit to Japan. The US is also allowing Japan to construct a deep-sea port in the Bay of Bengal that won’t be operational for several years. However, these facilities could potentially serve as a naval base for the United States. The construction of the port is believed to be a tactic for the United States to exert pressure on China. Additionally, it appears that Japan’s prime minister Kishida’s recent meeting with Modi in Delhi suggests that the port will also serve India as a transit point to connect its landlocked northeast with the Indian Ocean.

The Matarbari project is expected to positively impact India’s economy, potentially transforming its northeast region into a thriving industrial hub. This could lead to better political integration of the ‘Seven Sisters’ in the northeast with India. Additionally, a more integrated India would be less vulnerable to Chinese invasion and could stabilise the region. However, unless America, Japan, and their allies invest significantly in industrialisation in and around Matarbari, there may be little benefit for Bangladesh. The country would only have a deep-sea port and a large debt burden for decades, similar to Sri Lanka’s situation. Bangladesh’s decision to permit India to use alternative transit routes through Bangladesh and Matarbari to the Siliguri Corridor, also known as the ‘Chicken Neck,’ may result in Chinese military retaliation against the country. The Hasina administration has been criticised by the Chinese ambassador for getting too close to some ‘third countries’ (US and Japan) that are hostile towards China. Such criticism suggests that retaliation is a probable outcome.

Some analysts and experts might believe that America may be considering the establishment of a military base in the Bay of Bengal with Japan’s help. However, we should ask ourselves if this is the best course of action for Bangladesh. Additionally, we should consider if a deep-sea port is necessary and if Matarbari can replicate Singapore’s success. The answer to both of these questions is ‘no’. Bangladesh already has two seaports, Chattogram and Mongla, which are more than enough. This is clear from the fact that Bangladesh has proposed to India to use their existing seaports.

It’s time to contain China which has no qualms with promoting brutal autocratic regimes across the world. Tibet and Xinjiang are glaring examples of gross violations of all principles of democracy, freedom, and human rights within its annexed territories. China’s public support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine is another example in this regard. We know rogue and pariah regimes in North Korea, Myanmar, Cambodia, and among others, Bangladesh, wouldn’t have survived without China’s support. Having no respect for people’s right to self-determination, China wants to annex Taiwan. Last but not least, China’s not-so-subtle threats to India to grab chunks of its territory in the name of ‘undoing the past mistakes’ aren’t congenial to global peace and order. As ‘regime change’ by any superpower is obnoxious, so is any threat to alter the political geography of sovereign nations in the post-World War II era deplorable.

In the past, military pacts and bases strategically located have been used to contain rogue powers. However, it is important to respect the sovereignty of each country and consult with them before establishing a military base. In a democratic society, the majority should have the final decision. No country should be forced to sign an agreement allowing a foreign military base. Unfortunately, the unelected Hasina administration failed to publicly discuss the deep-sea port project with Japanese assistance, leading to speculation about the potential for a US military base in the Bay of Bengal. Transparency builds trust and lack of trust can lead to conflicts and wars. In summary, Hasina’s unpopularity in Bangladesh and diplomatic failures have caused an imbalance.

In summary, Hasina’s lack of popularity in Bangladesh and her failure to maintain a balance between the US and China have weakened her leadership. By favouring America and Japan, Hasina has alienated China, as evidenced by the Chinese ambassador’s warning to her regime. The Matarbari project could be detrimental to Hasina’s authoritarian leadership, while benefiting Delhi, Washington, and Tokyo. There is a possibility that a pro-Chinese military coup may remove her from power.

The DNCC announced Bushra Afreen as a chief heat officer for the city authority through a press release issued on Wednesday.

Bushra, the daughter of Dhaka north city mayor Atiqul Islam, has come under criticisms on the social media while many termed it an example of nepotism.

The mayor declared on Wednesday that the city corporation created the post of chief heat officer for the first time in Asia.

‘Today is a special day in my city. I am proud to announce the first chief heat officer for Dhaka North City Corporation,’ Atiq said in his speech as the chief guest at a programme titled ‘Building Urban Heat Resilience’ hosted in Dhaka university.

DU disaster science and climate resilience department and Dhaka North City Corporation in association with Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center’s (Arsht-Rock) hosted the event.

DNCC officials, however, said that the city authority’s organogram did not have any post for chief heat officer.

Asked, DNCC chief executive officer Selim Reza said, ‘Bushra is not the chief heat officer of the DNCC, and the city authority did not appoint her through any recruitment test.’

Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation appointed her for Asia, not for the DNCC, and she would get her salary from the foundation, added the CEO.

About the press release issued by the DNCC on Wednesday claiming the appointment of chief health officer, its public relations officer Mukbul Hossain said, ‘Our press release was confusing. We should have made it more clearly in the release.’

‘I do not know why people are so interested in her appointment, not in the good task that she would carry out. She is not an employee of the city corporation.’

In replay to another question, Mukbul said that the foundation would decide where she would do her office.

‘The foundation had chosen eight women across the globe, and Bushra is one of them,’ he pointed out.

1031,Bangladesh's forex reserves likely to fall to 7-year low next week,"The country’s foreign currency reserves are likely to fall to a seven-year low in the next week following a payment of $1.12 billion under the Asian Clearing Union.

Economists said that the reserves had been falling over the past 22 months despite multiple steps by the Bangladesh Bank as those could not give any major confidence to businesses involved in exports and imports.

Bangladesh Bank spokesperson Mezbaul Haque on Thursday said that the ACU payment had already been made for March and April.

The Bangladesh Bank along with other central banks of Bhutan, Iran, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar is a member of the ACU that arranges intra-regional transactions among its members.

The BB spokesperson said that the clearance of the ACU payment was expected on Monday.

The BB officials said that the country’s gross forex reserves would fall to $29.86 billion from $30.98 billion calculated on Tuesday (May 2).

In financial year 2015-16, the country’s forex reserves were $30.35 billion, according to the BB data.

It showed that the forex reserves stood at $33.6 billion in FY2016-17, but went down to $32.9 billion in FY2017-18 and $32.7 billion in FY2018-19.

Since FY2019-20, the forex reserves maintained an upward trend and reached an all-time high of $48 billion in August 2021.

Former Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed apprehended a further fall in the forex reserves in coming months because of downturn in export incomes and inflow of foreign remittance.

Export incomes which account almost 70 per cent of the forex reserves recorded negative growth for a second consecutive month.

In April, the exports declined by 16.52 per cent to $3.95 billion from $4.74 billion in 12 months.

The western economy is facing turmoil due to the Russia-Ukraine war and consumers are spending more for buying foods, medicines and other daily essentials.

The inflow of remittance that helps the country’s balance of payment dropped by more than 19 per cent in April.

The BB has imposed restrictions on imports and been able to bring down the opening of letters of credit to $51.36 billion in July-March of FY23 compared with $68.84 billion in the same period a year earlier.

But the BB initiatives did little because of less-than-expected improvement in export and remittance, said Selehuddin Ahmed.

The falling reserves are also concerning for keeping the country’s import payment at a comfortable level of four months as per recommendation of the International Monetary Fund.

The IMF has attached top priority to reserves buildup under its current $4.7 billion loan programme over the next three years.

It wanted the central bank to keep net reserves of some $24 billion by June.

In February, the IMF disbursed $476 million as the first tranche of its loan after successful negotiations with the government while the disbursement of next tranche of the remaining $4.2 billion loan in six installments is due in November.

Policy Research Institute executive director Ahsan H Mansur noted that the businesses were suffering a lack of confidence in the government measures taken to tackle the economic downturn since the previous year.

Exporters do not bring their export receipts timely, he said, adding that the Bangladeshi expatriates were reluctant to send money through official channel.

On Tuesday, an IMF mission at a meeting with commerce ministry officials found a gap of some $3 billion in export receipts.

The gap has been created as exporters did not bring the receipts back to the country within a stipulated time.

Besides, exporters brought home less than what was actually exported through under-invoicing linked to capital flight.

Mansur suggested that the BB should stop dollar sale to fix exchange rate and inflation to bring back business confidence in its steps.",,http://www.newagebd.net/article/200866/forex-reserves-to-fall-to-7-year-low-next-week,2023-05-18 10:38:19,newagebd
1032,40pc works still to be done as deadline missed,"Almost 40 per cent of the construction work of haor crops protection embankments in Sunamganj remained incomplete till Saturday, three days after the February 28 deadline, raising farmers’ fears that flash flood may damage their crop like last year.

Water resources ministry allotted Tk 177 crore to construct and repair a total of 550 kilometre embankments along 54 haors in the district, according to Water Development Board sources.

As per a ministry circular, a total of 975 projects were finalised to construct and repair embankments and the same number of project implementation committees comprising local farmers were also formed.

The ministry had instructed formation of the implementation committees by November 30 to start the project works by December 15, 2017 and complete them by February 28 this year.

But, farmers of different parts in the district alleged that apart from various irregularities, construction work of maximum 60 per cent of the haor crop protection dams was completed till Saturday.

Saidur Rahman, a farmer of village Bhorakhali along Naluar Haor at Jagannathpur, told New Age that they had expected that the work of dams would be completed in time since the embankments had been damaged by flash floods last year as the projects did not end in time.

‘Forty per cent work of the embankment near Bhorakhali Sluice Gate along the Naluar Haor has remained incomplete,’ he claimed.

Tahirpur upazila monitoring committee member Alamgir Hossain, also engineer of the upazila office of Local Government and Engineering Department, said that on average only 50 per cent work of the haor embankment projects were completed so far.

Freedom fighter Bazlul Mazid Chowdhury, convener of Haor Banchaw Sunamganj Banchaw Andolan, a local pressure group, said that they were in fear as the embankment construction and repair was not completed by the stipulated time.

‘The standing boro paddy on vast tracts of marshlands in the district may be damaged if case of any early flash flood like last years,’ he said.

Stating that government officials were claiming that 65 per cent works of the projects were completed so far, he asked, ‘When will be the rest work done? Who will take responsibility if the only annual crop of the haor belt’s farmers is damaged again in early flash flood?’

Sunamganj WDB-1 executive engineer Abu Bakkar Siddique Bhuiyan told New Age that the projects could not be completed in the stipulated time because of delayed beginning of the work.

‘The implementation committees could not start working in time because of slow recession of the haor water this year,’ he said, claiming that they were expecting that the remaining work would be completed within the next week.

Sunamganj deputy commissioner Sabirul Islam told New Age that everything was under their close watch.

‘Steps would be taken against the people concerned if the dams were not completed within

the first week of March,’ he warned.

The district Department of Agricultural Extension had set a target of

boro crop cultivation on 2,24,000 hector land this year and the target has been fulfilled.

According to the DAE, standing boro paddy of 1,66,612 hector out of a total 2,23,082 hector wetlands in the district was damaged badly by early flash flood triggered in the end of last March that affected 3.5 lakh families.

Organisations of the farmers and rights activists, however, claimed that more than 90 per cent of the standing boro was damaged by the floods.

1039,UN adopts resolution highlighting Sheikh Hasina’s innovative ‘Community Clinic’ model,"The United Nations on Tuesday (May 16) unanimously adopted the first-ever resolution on community-based health care.

The historic resolution, entitled, “Community-based primary health care: a participatory and inclusive approach to universal health coverage,” acknowledged the important role community clinics play in promoting primary health care, women’s empowerment, community engagement and mobilisation towards achieving universal access to health.

By introducing the “Community Clinic Model of Bangladesh’, the resolution asks member states to explore measures to scale up and reference best practices to benefit from successful national experience.

It reflects Bangladesh’s commitment to improve health and well-being of its citizens and to contributing to global health equity.

The Permanent Representative of Bangladesh to the United Nations in New York Ambassador Muhammad Abdul Muhith introduced the resolution in the General Assembly.

The resolution, first of its kind in the United Nations or the World Health Organization, was co-sponsored by 70 countries.

Referring to today’s adoption of the resolution as a watershed moment in global efforts for universal and equitable access to health for all, he said that implementation of the resolution can make a world of difference to the lives of billions and their families and communities around the world.

“It has a far-reaching impact in promoting international cooperation for universal health coverage as it invites international financial institutions, multilateral and regional development banks and donors to provide appropriate resources, especially for developing countries, to strengthen community-based health services towards the full implementation of the SDGs,” he further added.

To bring all people of Bangladesh under primary health care coverage, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina introduced this unique community clinic model in Bangladesh in 1998 which has revolutionized the health care delivery to reach the doorstep of people all over the country, particularly those in under-served areas and hard-to-reach populations.

The Government has so far established more than 14,000 community clinics all over the country, with each clinic serving 6000 population.

Adoption of the resolution is a great recognition to the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in accelerating the progress to universal health coverage and implementation of SDGs by 2030.

On behalf of the Bangladesh Permanent Mission in New York, the resolution was facilitated by Dr. Md. Monwar Hossain, Deputy Permanent Representative. The Mission has been playing a key role in the global health diplomacy over the last few years and as a continuation of its effort, this resolution was conceptualized and initiated by the Mission earlier this year.

After 4 months of intensive negotiations among the Member States, the resolution was adopted unanimously.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689857/UN-adopts-resolution-highlighting-Sheikh-Hasina’s-innovative-‘Community-Clinic’-model,2023-05-18 10:38:24,daily-sun

The weather department recorded 50 mm of rainfall in 24 hours, till 6 am today, said Bazlur Rashid, a meteorologist of Bangladesh Meteorological Department.

The rain in the morning, however, caused gridlock on several major streets in Dhaka, and city dwellers were stuck on the road during rush hour.

People, especially office and school goers, struggled to reach their destinations in the rain due to lack of public transport in the morning.

CNG-run auto-rickshaw drivers and rickshaw-pullers were seen charging fares higher than usual.

People were seen heading towards schools to drop their children with umbrellas and raincoats while traffic police were seen struggling to control vehicle movement during the rain.

1042,"Four kids, including baby, found alive in Amazon after plane crash","Four Indigenous children, including an 11-month-old baby, have been found alive in the dense Colombian Amazon after a plane crash more than two weeks ago, President Gustavo Petro said Wednesday, declaring ""joy for the country.""

Petro shared the news on Twitter, saying the children were discovered after ""arduous search efforts"" by the military.

Rescuers believe the children -- who in addition to the 11-month-old included a 13, 9, and 4 year old -- have been wandering through the jungle in the southern Caqueta department since the crash.

Earlier Wednesday, the armed forces said that search efforts intensified after rescuers came across a ""shelter built in an improvised way with sticks and branches,"" leading them to believe there were survivors.

In photographs released by the armed forces, scissors and a hair tie could be seen among branches on the jungle floor.

Previously, a baby's drinking bottle and a half-eaten piece of fruit had been found.

On Monday and Tuesday, soldiers found the bodies of the pilot and two adults who had been flying from a jungle location to San Jose del Guaviare, one of the main cities in Colombia's Amazon rainforest.

- Inaccessible region -

Giant trees that can grow up to 40 meters tall, wild animals and heavy rainfall made the ""Operation Hope"" search difficult.

Three helicopters have been used to help, one of which blasted out a recorded message from the children's grandmother in the Huitoto language telling them to stop moving through the jungle.

Authorities have not indicated what caused the plane crash.

The pilot had reported problems with the engine just minutes before the airplane disappeared from radars, Colombia's disaster response body said.

It is a region with few roads that is also difficult to access by river, so airplane transport is common.

The Huitoto, also spelled Witoto, are known for living in harmony with the remote jungle, and for their hunting, fishing and gathering skills which may have helped the children to survive.

Exploitation, disease and assimilation have reduced the population sharply over many decades.

1043,"2nd case against cyber criminals Tito Rahman, Nazmus Saquib in Rangpur","Notorious cyber criminals-cum-rapists Mostafizur Rahman alias Tito Rahman and Nazmus Saquib have been sued by a Chhatra League leader in Rangpur.

Sheikh Asif Hossain, general secretary of Rangpur city Chhatra League, lodged the case with the Rangpur Cyber Tribunal on Sunday.

In his case, Sheikh Asif Hossain brought the charges of spreading rumours against the government, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, her family members, important ministers and central leaders of the ruling party and top businessmen of the country.

Dr Abdul Mazid, Judge of the Cyber Tribunal, took cognizance of the case and directed the Superintendent of Police (PBI) to investigate into it and submit a report.

Other accused in the case are Ibrahim Ali and Anis Mia apart from eight to 10 people implicated unnamed.

It is learnt that accused Tito Rahman, son of the late Matiur Rahman of the capital's Jigatola area, resides in Canada. He introduced himself as the chief executive officer of a YouTube channel named Nagarik TV.

Najmus Saquib is the son of Jalilur Azam of Sabujbagh area. Being an expatriate in the United States, he introduced himself as the message editor of Nagarik TV.

In connivance with one another, the accused persons are engaged in rampant spread of rumours, offensive, ugly, false, fabricated, misleading and anti-state information against Bangabandhu's daughter Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her son Sajib Wazed Joy using various social media and online platforms, including YouTube.

The accused persons are not only spreading lies against the Prime Minister and her family but also against her relatives, various senior leaders of Awami League, and various party organs. They constantly spread rumours, even about the country's top business personalities.

Being implicated in rape and fraud cases, Mostafizur Rahman alias Tito Rahman and Nazmus Saquib left the country. Later, they got involved in the anti-nation conspiracy. They started online spread of rumours against the state, Bangabandhu, the Prime Minister and other important people of the country.

Tito Rahman's entire family is an anti-liberation force. His grandfather was a 71-year-old assassin; his father was a swindler. And Mostafizur Rahman has been aligned closely with people related to BNP-Jamaat since childhood. Apart from political identity, Mostafizur Rahman was known as a drug addict and oppressor of women in Dinajpur. Mostafizur Rahman was punished for eve-teasing. And lastly, while studying at Dinajpur University College, a student accused him of committing rape.

Tito’s cohort Nazmus Saquib was accused of raping a five-year-old child in Sabujbagh area of the capital in 2011. A case was lodged against him with Sabujbagh Police Station.

According to the case statement, the child lived with her family in a hut at 28 Mayakanan of the Sabujbagh area in Basabo. The victim's father used to drive a rental CNG-run auto bike. On the day, Nazmus Saquib, a drug addict, lured the small child with chocolates to take to his home at 28 Mayakanan. Then he took her to the roof and raped her several times. At one stage, Nazmus Shaquib left the child in the garage on the ground floor when excessive bleeding started. Bachchu Mia, the house's caretaker, came forward after hearing the child's cry. Seeing the pathetic condition of the child, the local people gathered around the house. Later, the child described the whole brutal incident. Afterwards, the victim became speech impaired.

Talking to press, complainant of case Sheikh Arif Hossain said the accused are spreading lies about the Prime Minister, country and nation and scandalising Chhatra League to damage longstanding reputation of the student wing of the ruling Awami League.

“The accused persons would like to block the democratic system of the country. So, I filed the case to bring them to book. I demand immediate arrest of the accused,” he added.

Appearing for the state, Ruhul Amin Talukder said “Taking cognizance of the case, the cyber tribunal ordered the PBI to investigate it. Sheikh Arif Hossain filed the case for spreading lies about Prime Minister, her family members and Awami League stalwarts and distorting name of BCL.”

Yesterday, former General Secretary of Rangpur Metropolitan Tushar Kanti Mondal filed a similar case against the same accused.

Tushar Kanti Mondal said “A case has been filed against four people for creating militancy and damaging the image of the country by insulting the honourable Prime Minister and her family. I want them to be arrested and brought to justice as soon as possible.”

In case the accused persons are not arrested, he threatened to go for a serious programme.

“I respect the court which has considered the case's merit. A YouTuber has made various talk-shows against the Hon'ble Prime Minister. This case has been filed in connection with damaging the country's image. I demand closure of these unauthorised online channels trying to destabilise the country by making false accusations,' Tushar Kanti Mondal added.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/688266/2nd-case-against-cyber-criminals-Tito-Rahman-Nazmus-Saquib-in-Rangpur,2023-05-18 10:38:26,daily-sun
1044,An Example of Tarique Zia’s Treason,"Sheikh Saadi says, ""A monkey is enough to destroy a beautiful garden."" If anyone analyzes the current situation in Bangladesh politics, he/she will see how true Sheikh Saadi's statement is. One party is corrupting politics under the dictatorships of a person, throwing the country into a crisis and trying to endanger democracy. We have passed 51 years of our independence. Looking back in this month of Independence, we still see a lot of imperfections, disappointment and pains in our politics. If we ask the question, do we want to see such politics in independent Bangladesh? I'm sure everyone will answer with a big NO. In an independent country, politics will be with the strategy of development, the system of changing fate of the people. The parties that come to power after the vote in an independent country will not argue about the history of the War of Liberation, the Father of the Nation and Bangladesh. In an independent country, anti-independence power cannot be allowed to pursue politics. In the name of politics, no one will be permitted to contradict the state. There will have to be mutual respect in politics. But, unfortunately, after 51 years of independence, the country is openly opposed in the name of politics. The criticism of the government is on a level that the state and the people are affected. Yet certain quarter wants to make Bangladesh a Pakistan or Afghanistan again. Some make politics a tool for extortion and looting. They cherish the sick, ugly genre of politics. They pursue scandalous politics, every day, every moment. One of them is Tarique Zia, the Acting Chairman of BNP, absconding in London. This is now the biggest poison in Bangladesh politics. Because of this, politics has become polluted and poisonous.

Recently I was surprised to see Tarique Zia's picture with two mischievous elements on YouTube. They are extortionists, fraudsters and anti-state criminals in the guise of journalists. They live abroad and blackmail people in the name through a YouTube channel. Questioning the character of the established and respected people of different levels of society in ugly and dirty language is their business. They are not journalists in any way. They are actually drains emitting foul smell. Some time ago, they were caught red handed while blackmailing one of the top industrial families in the country. They demanded six lakh dollars from an employee of the industrial family. The record of their conversation is still available on YouTube. In that conversation, it is seen how low quality they are. After that conversation spread on social media, much hue and cry were raised at home and abroad. Everyone was shocked at their misdeeds. Even the BNP-based social media activists, intellectuals and journalists in the country and abroad were shocked after this incident of dirty incident. The BNP loyalists who like to criticize the government abroad could not accept this inferior blackmailing. Everyone began to boycott the rogue extortionists. Even a BNP-backed journalist among the expats identified their misconduct as a punishable offense in the criminal law.

Several things are proved through this. First of all, the platform on which these two and their associates are spreading falsehoods and impersonations against the state, against the government, against various individuals and businesses, is actually under the control of Tarique Zia. Tarique is their lord and mentor. These anti-national lies are going on under the instructions of Tarique. Tarique's interests include blackmail, extortion, and nefarious activities of impersonation. The godfather of these miscreants is actually Tarique Zia. I don't know if Tarique Zia also gets a share of the money that these miscreants got by threatening different people of defamation. However, they have a strange similarity with Tarique Zia. Like the duo Tarique-Mamun, these miscreants have committed crimes of extortion, fraud and intimidation abroad. Before the 2001 elections, Tarique Zia built Hawa Bhavan. Hawa Bhaban's main activity was extortion, collecting money through illegal means. The main mission of Hawa Bhavan was to bring the election results in their favour through institutional manipulation. For this purpose, they had already subdued the caretaker government led by Latifur Rahman and made MA Saeed submissive and loyal to the Election Commission. He went to India and fought to come to power under any conditions. And the results of this collective effort were visible in the October 1, 2001 elections. Despite getting 42 percent of votes, Awami League got very less seats. Tarique Zia knew that he had not won more than two-thirds of the seats in the popular vote. Rather, this result is due to the 'systematic mechanism'. And so Tarique Zia started a brutal mission to wipe out Awami League and minorities right from the night of the election. The ordeal started from the night of October 1. Awami League leaders and workers are subjected to medieval brutality throughout the country. Minority houses were burnt. Women were raped and tortured indiscriminately. The only reason for this was that the minorities were supporters of Awami League. And this planned terror was conducted under the guidance of Hawa Bhavan.

After the October 2001 elections, the BNP-Jamaat alliance seized power. But the real power belonged to Tarique Zia’s Hawa Bhavan. Begum Zia was the prime minister but she was just a puppet. Tarique Zia axed all powers. He had his own minister of state in almost all the ministries. State ministers became more powerful than ministers. Business, tender, recruitment, transfer, promotion everything went under the control of Hawa Bhaban. Before doing any business, they had to pay Hawa Bhaban a large sum of money. Tarique's close friend Giasuddin Mamun controlled the government tenders. Be it BCS, police SI or school teacher, enrolment in Hawa Bhaban with money was mandatory. The list of employers used to go from Hawa Bhavan. A person enlisted in Hawa Bhaban whether he is qualified or not, whether he passes the written test or not, he has to be given the job. Otherwise, the employer would be in trouble. The big businessmen had to pay Hawa Bhaban and Tarique's partner Giasuddin Al Mamun used to fix the amount of money. VAT had to be paid to Hawa Bhaban every month from various ministries and departments. This VAT was collected by Harish Chowdhury, the Prime Minister's number one political secretary. Posts like chief forest officer, chairman of Rajuk were up for auction. Under the management of Harish Chowdhury, the person who offered the most money in the auction was appointed to that position.

Everyone knows about the electricity pole project. Tarique-Mamun duo looted thousands of crores of money from the government treasury without producing one megawatt of electricity. These looted moneys went abroad. Money laundering in Bangladesh was institutionalized under the leadership of Tarique Zia. This son of corruption has smuggled crores of money to different countries of the world. With which he is living a royal life comfortably in London.

Tarique Zia wanted a permanent settlement of power. For this he first destroyed the caretaker government. The constitution was amended to make Justice KM Hasan the head of the caretaker government. After that, the BNP government turned the election commission into a den of clowns. A list of one and a half million fake voters was prepared from Hawa Bhaban and given to the Election Commission. Such a situation was created that it became impossible for any party except BNP to win the election. Even after doing all this, Tarique Zia could not be satisfied. That is why the 'master plan' to eliminate Awami League leadership was adopted. On August 21, 2004, the worst grenade attack in political history of Bangladesh took place. Tarique Zia wanted to bid farewell to Sheikh Hasina by bombing. But the Awami League president miraculously survived. After that, one drama after another was staged to cover up this incident.

Tarique Zia, like his father, wanted to make Bangladesh another Pakistan. That is why various militant organizations like Bangla Bhai emerged under his patronage. Tarique started sponsoring Indian separatists with the advice and help of Pakistan. The big proof of this is the episode of 10 truckloads of weapons. Evidence of Tarique's association with Indian separatists, extremists and various militant organizations has emerged in US secret documents. Those documents were leaked out by WikiLeaks.

Tarique Zia is in London since 2008 and is doing the same sort of crime that he committed from 2001 to 2006. Sitting in London, he is continuing extortion and doing committee trade. It is now an open secret in BNP that without money one cannot even enter the ward committee. In BNP, those dedicated leaders do not get a place in any committee. Each of the BNP's committee announcements led to protests and revolts. Who got which position with how much money is openly discussed. Let's take the 2018 election. BNP decided to participate in that election unconditionally. National Unity Front was formed under the leadership of Dr. Kamal Hossain on the instructions of Tarique. Mischievous persons say Tarique needed money at the time. This is the reason to go to the election. It is heard that about 500 crore nomination trade was made in that election. In various constituencies, those deprived of nominations held public press conferences and said how many nominations were sold. Can a party win an election with two or more candidates in each of almost all seats?

Many people think that the main goal of BNP's movement is extortion. This is because of the experience of 2013, 14 and 15. At that time, the group committed arson, looting and vandalism under Tarique's orders. The violent movement of that time was conducted with the aim of extorting money by scaring the traders. This time also at the beginning of the movement, various businessmen were called. Tarique Zia or his nominee would call and they were intimidated. Many businessmen want to have a relationship with both sides. Many people close to Hawa Bhaban, one of Tarique's financiers, are now close and confidants of the Awami League government. They started secretly sending money to Tarique Zia out of fear or thinking that BNP might come back to power. BNP organized a hotchpotch festival in the name of mass gathering with that smuggled money. Accomplices in this extortion mission of Tarique Zia were two miscreants known as extortionists, fraudsters on social media. This one photo reveals Tarique's secret bond with the extortionist gang. This picture is an authentic document of Tarique Zia's treason. Garbage filled so called channels are constantly airing offensive obscenities against the state. Since Tarique Zia is the patron of this abominable treasure, it is an irrefutable proof that he is a traitor. It is now as clear as water that on his orders some perverts are talking against the country. BNP's self-proclaimed acting chairman on the run in London has been sentenced to life imprisonment in a case. The court sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment in a money laundering case. According to an order of the High Court, any statement from Tarique Zia is banned from broadcasting in Bangladesh.

According to the law of Bangladesh, Tarique Zia is a warrantless convict. Most Wanted. Tarique is also known internationally as a mafia don or godfather. No one considers him as a politician. But we often see Tarique Zia joining online in various functions of BNP. Talk on video conference. It amounts to contempt of court.

I think, immediately law enforcement agency and the honourable court should take exemplary action in this regard. Also, the pictures of the two miscreants published with the most wanted Tarique Zia in the name of so-called interview, all their content needs to be banned in Bangladesh. The Hon'ble High Court has taken a number of landmark decisions. In this case, it is necessary to stop these anti-national garbages, foul-smelling words in Bangladesh. Urgent intervention of the judiciary is necessary in this regard. Otherwise, no one will be spared from their nasty game. Besides, the convicted Tarique Zia should be brought back to the country immediately. He should be brought under the law. For this, honest and brave people should be placed in related places including foreign missions because Tarique Zia's followers are still wreaking havoc on the government. Those who still dream of putting Tarique Zia in power are harmful to the state. Now is the high time to identify them.

1045,Three cyber offenders tarnishing country’s image,"Three lunatic cyber criminals and fundamentalists have sided with the war crimes convicts and accused. The trio is criticising the execution of war criminals by spreading propaganda and distorted videos on social media.

The lunatics -- Abu Reza Ahmed Faisal Chowdhury Suyeb, a so-called anti-nationalist and misguided journalist; Pinaki Bhattacharya, a self-proclaimed agnostic; and Taj Hashmi, a misguided analyst and an atheist -- are harmful for Bangladesh as well as the host countries.

None of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangabandhu family, BNP chairperson and acting chairman, political parties, Hinduism, Islam, Quran, Allah and God is spared from their criticism.

There is a great similarity between the works of the trio that they take the side of the war criminals and spread militancy in the country.

Talking to this reporter, a police official said the lunatics are abusing freedom abroad to speak whatever they like on social media platforms. They are plotting to obstruct the development of the country, tarnish its image and turn it into a failed state and create a congenial atmosphere for war criminals and militancy. Some of the culprits are linked to international militant outfits IS and Hizb-ut-Tahrir. Some of them are also suspected to be paid agents of Jamaat-e-Islami and Pakistani intelligence agencies.

Reza Ahmed Faisal Chowdhury alias Suyeb

Reza Ahmed Faisal Chowdhury alias Suyeb, hailing from Patli village in Patli union of Jagannathpur upazila in Sunamganj, is on the list of top anti-state cyber criminals. He was once managing director of the Europe office of Channel i in London. Although he was terminated from the job, he is still abusing the channel’s identity. When he was in the country, he married a physician named Anwara Ali through fraudulence.

He currently runs an infamous Facebook page called Channel Europe and makes provocative statements against the Bangladesh government, judiciary, army, ruling Awami League and different industrialists and businessmen.

The Channel i authorities have removed him from its Europe office.

Replying to a query, a senior official of the channel said: “Suyeb has been removed from the Europe office for his failure to show account of income and expenditure, embezzlement of money and public statements in favour of war criminals.”

To overcome the financial crisis, the overambitious has launched a Facebook page running an online programme called 'Straight Dialogue'. The talkative often comes live and vomits indecent and anti-state speeches.

Without having any viewers, he posts the videos on YouTube and Facebook in the hope of getting likes and comments. He is also a regular analyst at the Canadian infamous YouTube channel and Facebook page Nagorik TV. The main job of the so-called journalist is to spread propaganda against the government, the Prime Minister, industrialists and various established businessmen. He has been lying against Posts and Telecommunications Minister Mustafa Jabbar.

In addition, the self-proclaimed scholar hurls abuses at Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal, Law Minister Anisul Huq and IGP Dr Benazir Ahmed, S Alam Group Chairman Mohammed Saiful Alam, Exim Bank Chairman Nazrul Islam and Padma Bank Chairman Chowdhury Nafees Sharafat. Suyeb was defeated in mayoral polls in Tower Hamlets in London by getting ridiculous number of votes. He put Conservative Party in a farcical position. Earlier, his first wife contested such polls.

Cyber criminals Barrister Sarwar Hossain, M Rahman Masum, Tito Rahman and Nazmus Sakib regularly take part in his 'Straight Dialogue'.

Asked about Suyeb, a senior journalist from Sunamganj said, ""Suyeb is a tout and a mischievous person. None of Sheikh Hasina, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman is liked by him. He seems to be the only honest person in the world and all others are bad. However, he has been removed from the responsibility of Channel i for embezzlement of money. Now, he pretends to be big news analyst, showing erudition in all matters.”

Terming Suyeb a lunatic, he said Suyeb has no footing. He is neither a BNP supporter nor an Awami Leaguer nor a leftist. He does not know what to say and what to do. In the hope of getting cheap popularity on Facebook and YouTube, he goes crazy all the time.

The crazy people like him should be ignored. Suyeb used to work in a small room at Channel i’s Europe office and invite various people and collect money from them and take other undue advantages. Losing that job, he comes live on Facebook and speaks like a mad.

Pinaki Bhattacharya

Dr Pinaki Bhattacharya is the eldest son of late teacher and cultural personality Shyamal Bhattacharya of Bogura Zila School. His mother's name is Supriti Bhattacharya. His brother Apurba Bhattacharya lives in Dhaka and sister Bulbul Bhattacharya in Bogura. Pinaki was ousted from house by his father for speaking against traditional religion, politics and religious harmony. The man, who sought political asylum in France, escaped in 2020 by evading notice of law enforcement agencies. Before leaving, he spread various propagandas expressing his fear of falling prey to forced disappearance.

Pinaki Bhattacharya has been sharply critical of various provisions of traditional religion on his own YouTube channel. He is trying to spread hatred against followers of traditional religion by taking a stand in favour of cow-killing.

Pinaki, who mocks Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has publicly opposed the trial of the perpetrators of the 1971 wartime crimes. He criticises law and mocks convictions of war criminals and contempt of court.

Pinaki Bhattacharya has called for a boycott of the mass procession and the celebration of the Bengali New Year, the Pahela Boishakh.

Pinaki harshly rebuffs police's anti-drug drives in 2018. He described killing of criminals in gunfight with police as ""extrajudicial killing"" and supported drug traffickers. During quota reform and safe road movements, he instigated tender-hearted children of schools and colleges to take to the street endangering their lives.

He was summoned by law enforcement agencies on August 5, 2018 due to his controversial activities. And he voluntarily went into hiding. He secretly crossed the border into Bangkok in January 2019 and fled to France to seek political asylum. From France, he is constantly spreading hatred against religion, culture of the country, government, army and Bangabandhu family. He is trying to question issues like independence, sovereignty, national flag and national anthem.

Pinaki joked about the creator in February 2013 series of his “Conversations with God”. He also spoke in favour of killing blogger Asif and Abhijit Roy.

Addressing Pinaki, one blogger wrote on Muktamana blog, “Pinaki Bhattacharya, you can be a believer in any legitimate political doctrine. That is your democratic right. I have no say in that. You are a two-faced character. You are a Hindu by birth but you claim to be an agnostic (agnosticism is a doctrine or an idea made up of a number of arguments. It is not a religion. It neither denies nor acknowledges the existence of God). You did not convert to Islam, but wear a beard, put on hat and Punjabi. Citing the example of Raja Ram Mohan Roy, you tend to say that madrasa education is superior. But you don't send your children and relatives to pursue madrasa education. You and your family have not converted to Islam despite the fact that Islamic education is so good. None of them came to the path of light. On the other hand, you are in an open relationship without following the religious rites of marriage, which of course you can do as an agnostic. You appreciate the Islamic way but it has no application in your own life!”

Writer Sheikh Taslima Moon wrote on a website called the Women’s Chapter, “Pinaki understands that fundamentalism is a rising force in the region. Whichever government comes, it is not possible for them to continue power without rubbing oil on their feet.

They are the main force. So, Pinaki has analysed that his power and strength are stronger than any government in Bangladesh. The government will go, the government will change, but their power will only continue to grow and this is the main source of all his courage. Pinaki is the name of dishonesty and a terrible terror to us. He has created a circle consisting of the people who have become a threat to the country's free-thinking practices and democracy. ... and Pinaki, I'll tell you, the only vampire doesn't have a conscience. But humans have a conscience. I know that what you are doing is a deliberate decision of your cold head. By doing this game, you feel an ugly joy inside you. But I believe, all games have an end. The games are over at a certain point of time. We are also watching you with interest. Remember, no one is above conscience and judgment at the end of the day. “ According to analysts, Pinaki Bhattacharya is abusing Hindu name in an attempt to gain support for extremists like Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Al-Qaeda and ISIS.

He tries to create an impression that a Hindu is supporting the militants on objective point of view. This is just a ploy of the extremists. The statements he preaches have no reflection in real life.

Taj Hashmi

Taj Hashmi is a refugee without the address of his father and grandfather in Bangladesh. With mysterious origin, Taj Hashmi lives at Montreal in Canada. He claims that he was born in Assam. He passed matriculation from Sirajganj BL College and later got admitted to Dhaka College.

Taj Hashmi, who claims to have an honours and masters from the Department of Islamic History and Culture at Dhaka University, is now a deadly negative analyst of various Facebook-YouTube-based channels. This person is always active in obstructing the development of the country, spreading religious incitement and destroying the communal harmony of the country.

Many call him a paid agent of Pakistan or a 'Paki Dalal'. Before independence, he moved to Rawalpindi in Pakistan. Opposing the country's independence, the self-proclaimed pundit has taken a public stand in favour of war criminals in Canada.

Analysts say Taj Hashmi, a supporter of the Salafi ideology, acts as an agent for the spread of militancy and ISIS ideology in the country. He is trying to gain support for militancy by writing on Facebook, quoting various statements by Afghan extremist Jamal al-Din Afghani.

Evidence of Taj Hashmi's distorted mentality and religious incitement can be seen in a few recent quotes on his own Facebook page. He mocked Mufti Kazi Ibrahim, who was arrested on September 30, as a ""comedian"" on his Facebook page. On May 11, he wrote, ""Azhari and Kazi Ibrahim are inciting persecution of women in the name of Waz with obscene and bizarre statements.""

Taj slammed the Prime Minister's speech on September 26 as ""useless speech"".

On his Facebook page on July 4, he lashed out at the war crimes tribunal under the headline 'Some old talk about the so-called war criminal tribunal'. Criticising Ganajagaran Mancha on July 1, he wrote, ""Innocent people like Maulana Matiur Rahman Nizami, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury and Quader Mollah have been hanged.""

On May 10, he criticised the Prime Minister and wrote, ""Hasina is not forgiven even in the court of Allah!"" On May 7, he wrote “90 percent of the people engaged in prayers and fasting are great thieves.”

On May 4, 2013, he wrote, ""On the night of May 5/6, 2013, 300 Hefazat workers went missing due to an act of the government. The tamarind lord (Allama Ahmad Shafi) forgot the issue taking bribes. But the nation forgot the issue without taking anything!” On April 26, he issued a statement to boycott products of Beximco.

Taj Hashmi wrote on his Facebook page on April 26 to spread adultery, “People in very hot or cold countries have more sexual arousal (as per science). So, they can marry two, three or four! Have the girls of those countries had less sexual arousal? Asking scientists.""

This corona will hasten the downfall of Hasina, her downfall is inevitable,"" he wrote on April 22 in a show of anger against the government.

On April 17, he wrote to provoke the common people against the government, ""Misogyny, the Saudi dynasty, the Hasina government and Indian friends cannot be good people.""

“Dr. Hasina. No one says that she was the first to buy fake honorary doctorates from abroad with the money of the country!” he wrote on April 13.

On April 7, he wrote “Hasina abandoned friends like old shoes after her purpose is over.”

These are just a sample of Taj Hashmi's religious incitement and political hatred. No one in his family is known to have ever worn the veil. That Culprit is now making negative comments about hijab and veil. He tried to malign Bangladesh foreign minister by writing an open letter. He raised many absurd questions and tried to tarnish his image internationally.

Taj Hashmi took part in the analysis on the infamous YouTube based channel Nagorik TV along with two other culprits Tito Rahman and Nazmus Shakib who are in Canada.

He made indecent, false and bizarre remarks on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangabandhu family, established businessmen and industrial groups.

Asked about Taj Hashmi, a senior intelligence official said “This man named Taj Hashmi has a sick brain. He is going crazy on social media and various talk-shows. Without considering class of people, the talk-show organisers are giving him the title of big analyst or intellectual. Taj Hashmi is trying to spread religious incitement and gain support for extremism.”",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/687238/Three-cyber-offenders-tarnishing-country’s-image,2023-05-18 10:38:27,daily-sun
1046,Nazmus Saquib leads lavish life in USA after committing rape,"In 2011, the incident of rape of a 5-year-old child in the Sabujbagh area of the capital caused a stir across the country. How is that little baby? Investigation finds that she lost the power to speak after that brutal incident. The speech-impaired girl is now fighting a brutal life. And, that rapist Nazmus Saquib is leading a lavish life in the USA.

The little child did not get justice even after taking legal steps. The rapist's family wanted to manage the child's father in exchange for money. But the victim's family wanted nothing but justice. They also filed a case. However, the rapist Najmus Saquib escaped the country with the power of his influential father Jalilul Azam.

After this incident, Najmus Sakquib's father Jalilul Azam along with the child's father first took her to Mugda Hospital. Later Mugda Hospital authorities transferred the child to Dhaka Medical College Hospital (MDCH) when her situation deteriorated. After about 28 days of treatment at DMCH, the child survived but became speech impaired. The child lost the power to speak due to rape, excessive stress and excessive blood loss, according to the medical report.

To hide the incident at that time, Nazmus Sakib's maternal uncle Abu Dayan and his father Jalilul Azam wanted to convince the girl's family by giving money to cover up the matter. But the child's father wanted justice rather than taking money. The victim’s father filed a rape case against rapist Saquib with Sabujbagh police station, ignoring the bloodshot eyes of Sakib's influential father and uncle.

Nazmus Saquib was on the run for some time after the case. At one stage, he left the country and is now leading a lavish life in the United States of America (USA). Sitting there, the alleged rapist is spreading various lies and rumours against esteemed personalities of Bangladesh through his so-called IP TV. He introduces himself as the editor of Nagorik TV.

It was found that the house where the child's family used to live is no longer there. The family left the area three years after the rape incident as they could not bear the stigma of rape.

Mobashwer Hossain, a local resident said, ‘The child's family eventually left the area due to public shame. Because, everyone knows the child was the rape victim of Najmus Sakib.’

Pointing to the girl sitting in the next room, he said, ""The rapist Nazmus Sakib has robbed happiness of my family.” ""My healthy daughter could not bear the stress of the incident and lost the power to speak. She can't speak after that incident. After a month of treatment, she survived. Seeing such suffering of my daughter, my heart breaks. Najmus Saquib has ended my daughter's life,' he added with an angry voice.

Incidentally, Nazmus Saquib, who is used to perverted sexual behaviour, also raped his cousin Kazi Rubaiya. After that, when Rubaiya became pregnant, Nazmus Sakib married her under family pressure. Apart from this, several allegations of sexual abuse against Najmus Saquib in the area including his grandmother. Khilgaon, Sabujbagh and Motijheel police stations have multiple cases and general diaries also. Nazmus Saquib and his gang also gang-raped the wife of Rezaul Karim of Daudkandi, Comilla, a tenant of Nazmus Saquib's Basabor house. The husband and wife left the area after the incident in 2010. Fearing public shame, they filed no cases against the serial rapist. They left home silently at that time. The victim’s husband Rezaul now lives in the Pirer Bagh area of Mirpur.

He said, 'Nazmus Saquib is settled in the USA and runs so called TV shows on YouTube. I don't want to remember that day anymore. My wife tries to commit suicide when she remembers her sexual abuse. We are somehow living with the pain the crime.'",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/687404/Nazmus-Saquib-leads-lavish-life-in-USA-after-committing-rape-,2023-05-18 10:38:27,daily-sun
1047,"Cyber terrorists and rapists Titu Rahman, Najmus Saquib booked in Rangpur","# Both culprits are spreading misleading information from abroad

# Victims want to bring them back to Bangladesh for justice

Staying abroad, Titu Rahman and Nazmus Saquib are engaged in unbridled spread of misleading and fabricated information against Bangladesh, government high-ups, and esteemed business personalities for a long time through so-called Nagorik TV.

Nazmus Saquib left the country after a rape case against him with Sabujbagh Police Station for violating a child brutally, and the victim has become speech impaired permanently.

Tushar Kanti Mondal, former General Secretary of Rangpur Metropolitan Awami League, filed the case as a complainant in the Rangpur Cyber Tribunal Court on Sunday.

Co-accused in the case are Ibrahim Ali and Anis Mia while eight to 10 people have been implicated unnamed.

Accused Tito Rahman, son of the late Matiur Rahman of the capital's Jigatola area, resides in Canada. He introduced himself as the chief executive officer of a YouTube channel named Nagarik TV.

Considering the case's merit, the judge, Dr Abdul Mazid, ordered the Rangpur Superintendent of Police (CID) to investigate it.

Shammi Akhtar, Azgar Ali, Aminul Islam, and Ahsan Habib Jewel appeared for the complainant while Ruhul Amin Talukder for the state.

According to case dossier, the accused persons are engaged in unbridled spread of rumours, offensive, ugly, false, fabricated, misleading and anti-state information against Bangabandhu's daughter Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her son Sajib Wazed Joy using various social media and online platforms, including YouTube.

Not just the Prime Minister and her family; the accused are also spreading misleading and false information against her relatives, various senior leaders of Awami League, and various party organs. They constantly spread rumours, even about the country's top business personalities.

Former General Secretary of Rangpur Metropolitan Awami League, Tushar Kanti Mondal, the complainant, said “A case has been filed against four people for creating militancy and damaging the image of the country by insulting the honourable Prime Minister and her family. I want them to be arrested and brought to justice as soon as possible.”

However, if not arrested, he threatened to give a big programme.

“I respect the court which has considered the case's merit. A YouTuber has made various talk-shows against the Hon'ble Prime Minister. This case has been filed in connection with damaging the country's image. I demand closure of these unauthorised online channels trying to destabilise the country by making false accusations,' Tushar Kanti Mondal added.

Sheikh Asif Hossain, general secretary of Rangpur city Chhatra League, filed another case with the same court over similar allegations. The court has taken cognizance of the case pending hearing.

After being charged with various crimes, including rape and fraud, Mostafizur Rahman alias Tito Rahman and Nazmus Saquib left the country. Later, they got involved in the anti-nation conspiracy. They started online spread of rumours against the state, Bangabandhu, the Prime Minister and other important people of the country.

Tito Rahman's entire family harbours an anti-liberation stand. His grandfather was a 71-year-old assassin; his father was a swindler. And Mostafizur Rahman has been aligned closely with people related to BNP-Jamaat since childhood. Apart from political identity, Mostafizur Rahman was known as a drug addict and oppressor of women in Dinajpur. Mostafizur Rahman was punished for eve-teasing. And lastly, while studying at Dinajpur University College, a student accused him of committing rape.

Meanwhile, Nazmus Saquib was accused of raping a five-year-old child in Sabujbagh area of the capital in 2011. A case was lodged against him with Sabujbagh Police Station.

According to the case statement, the child lived with her family in a hut at 28 Mayakanan of the Sabujbagh area in Basabo. The victim's father used to drive a rental CNG-run auto bike. On the day, Nazmus Saquib, a drug addict, lured the small child with chocolates to take to his home at 28 Mayakanan. Then he took her to the roof and raped her several times. At one stage, Nazmus Shaquib left the child in the garage on the ground floor when excessive bleeding started. Bachchu Mia, the house's caretaker, came forward after hearing the child's cry. Seeing the pathetic condition of the child, the local people gathered around the house. Later, the child described the whole brutal incident. Afterwards, the victim became speech impaired.

State lawyer Ruhul Amin Talukdar said, 'A case has been filed against four persons in the Rangpur Cyber Tribunal for insulting the Hon'ble Prime Minister and his family, Law Minister and Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader to spoil the image of the country. We want justice at the earliest.'",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/688113/Cyber-terrorists-and-rapists-Titu-Rahman-Najmus-Saquib-booked-in-Rangpur,2023-05-18 10:38:33,daily-sun

1049,Man City hit Real Madrid for four to reach Champions League final,"Manchester City produced a landmark performance to reach the Champions League final as Bernardo Silva's double put Real Madrid to the sword in a 4-0 thrashing that secured a 5-1 aggregate win for the English champions on Wednesday.

Eder Militao's own goal and Julian Alvarez's strike in stoppage time rounded off a memorable night for Pep Guardiola's men as they moved to within three wins of matching Manchester United's treble in 1998/99.

A fifth Premier League title in six seasons appears a formality with City needing just three points from their final three games, while United await in the FA Cup final on June 3.

But it is a first ever Champions League that City crave the most and they will be strong favourites to finally conquer Europe against Inter Milan in Istanbul on June 10.

Seven years into Guardiola's reign as City boss, the home fans were sent into seventh heaven by the quality of a display that rivalled the former Barcelona boss' Champions League final wins in charge of the Catalan giants in 2009 and 2011.

Madrid dashed City's dreams at this stage last season with a remarkable comeback from two goals down in the dying seconds of the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu.

But Carlo Ancelotti's men this time had no answer to City's excellence.

""Today it all came out in our energy and desire. Sport always give you a second chance to take revenge. We had the luck to get that chance this year and we took it.""

Were it not for Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, the defending champions would have been on the end of a hiding before half-time.

The giant Belgian needed all of his two-metre (6ft 7in) frame to claw Erling Haaland's header round the post.Haaland had already been denied his 53rd goal of the season by Courtois with another downward header.

Rodri, John Stones and Jack Grealish also saw pot shots fly off target from the edge of the area, but Madrid's luck finally ran out on 23 minutes.

Kevin De Bruyne unpicked the lock as his pass found Silva inside the area, and he smashed high past Courtois' left hand.

- No 'drama' for Ancelotti –

The visitors had barely registered a touch inside the City half for the opening half hour, but were inches away from an equaliser 10 minutes before half-time when a piledriver from Toni Kroos rattled the crossbar.

Just as Madrid were beginning to settle, City grabbed the second goal their first half dominance deserved.

The in-form Ilkay Gundogan was denied a fifth goal in May by Militao's block, but the ball looped up kindly for Silva to head into an unguarded net.City had to show a different side to their game early in the second-half to weather Madrid's reaction and ensure there was no repeat of last season's late drama between the sides.

""We have played against a team that deserved to win,"" said Ancelotti.

""We don't have to make a drama of it. This squad did very well this year, did very well last year and we weren't able to reach another final.""

The closest Real came to a lifeline was a dipping free-kick from David Alaba that Ederson tipped over.

At the other end Courtois continued to win his personal battle with Haaland by turning the Norwegian's shot onto the bar when one-on-one.

But City won the war to move within one match of completing a transformation in the club's fortunes since an Abu Dhabi-backed takeover in 2008.

The next blow to the Spanish giants was self-inflicted as Militao deflected Manuel Akanki's header past Courtois 15 minutes from time.

Haaland was replaced by Alvarez two minutes from the end and that was all the Argentine World Cup winner needed to make his mark as he slotted home from Phil Foden's pass.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/690021/Man-City-hit-Real-Madrid-for-four-to-reach-Champions-League-final,2023-05-18 10:38:34,daily-sun
1050,Moscow to host Armenia-Azerbaijan talks Friday,"MOSCOW - The foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan are set to meet in Moscow on Friday for talks on resolving a decades-long territorial dispute, Russia said.

The meeting follows several rounds of talks led by the European Union and United States.

A meeting involving the foreign ministers of Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan ""will take place in Moscow on May 19,"" Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters.

Before the trilateral talks the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers, Ararat Mirzoyan and Jeyhun Bayramov, are expected to discuss a draft peace treaty, she said.

Baku and Yerevan fought two wars -- in 2020 and in the 1990s -- for control of Azerbaijan's Armenian-populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh.

Six weeks of hostilities in autumn 2020 ended with a Russian-brokered ceasefire that saw Armenia cede swathes of territory it had controlled for decades.

""It is not possible to face the new challenges of education in the 21st century only with traditional education. Everyone has to work together to bring changes in the education system in the new era since blending education system is a part for bringing the change,"" she said.

Education Ministry in collaboration with the World Economic Forum and Aspire to Innovate-a2i organized the consultation, while State Minister for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Zunaid Ahmed Palak and Deputy Minister of Education Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury were present as special guests.

1052,Country's economy returns to normalcy from 2022 after pandemic: BIDS,"DHAKA- The country's economy has normalized from the beginning of 2022 although the poverty rate in the country got doubled from April to June 2020 following the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In continuation of the trend of recovery, the poverty rate in the country has now come down at 18.7 percent.

Planning Minister MA Mannan spoke at the programme as the chief guest while State Minister for Planning Dr Shamsul Alam spoke as special guest. Planning Division Secretary Satyajit Karmakar spoke as the guest of honour.

Criticizing the data of a research organization that the poverty rate in the country shoot up to 42 percent during the pandemic, Dr Binayek said, ""There were debates over the data of the poverty rate during the pandemic. Based on the facts of 2020, some of our like-minded research firms said that the poverty rate was doubled during that time of pandemic. Actually, they had committed errors while accomplishing their tasks in a hurry.""

Private think tank SANEM published research findings in January 2021 after conducting the survey among some 5,577 families under 64 districts in 8 divisions during the period of November and December in 2020 where they showed that the poverty rate in the country climbed up to 42 percent. The media also provided a massive coverage of the findings of that survey, he added.

Regarding that survey, the BIDS Director General said, ""The fact of the matter was although poverty rate increased during that time, but that was for a temporary period which was from April to June, 2020. After June, the poverty rate started to come down again.""

He said after overcoming the shocks of various variants of the COVID-19, the economy again started to come to its normal pace from the beginning of 2022. ""But, that doesn't mean that people gave their labour here and there, rather the non-farm self employment of the country's people played a big role.""

He said the survey indicates that the economy of the country came to normalcy from the beginning of 2022.

The renowned economist said in between 2019 and 2022, the overall poverty rate came down by 4.3 percent while extreme poverty rate by 3.2 percent. ""This is a significant progress in reducing poverty through braving the shocks of the pandemic,"" he added.

According to the latest data of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the overall poverty rate in the country is 18.7 percent of which half have been emerged as new poor.

Suggesting the government to take necessary steps to alleviate these new poor above the poverty line, he said that the government should also take special measures to return the drop out students in the schools.

Side by side, Dr Binayek stressed on proper utilization of the social safety net programmes alongside taking those measures which would help to reduce poverty in the country.

Speaking on the occasion as the chief guest, Planning Minister MA Mannan said that although many organizations delivered various types of data during the pandemic, but the latest findings of the BBS on poverty rate showed that the government is in the right direction.

Mentioning that inequality is the initial problem of every developing country, he said that there is a need to reduce disparity through creating new resources and ensuring proper distribution of those resources in a just way in the social safety net initiatives.

State Minister for Planning Dr Shamsul Alam said that when the country was heading towards higher growth, the pandemic and the onslaught of Russia-Ukraine war came all on a sudden hampering the momentum to some extent.

Dr Alam also emphasized on proper implementation of the poverty alleviation related projects alongside conducting a mid-term review of the Eight Five Year Plan and thus taking necessary steps in this regard.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689907/Countrys-economy-returns-to-normalcy-from-2022-after-pandemic:-BIDS,2023-05-18 10:38:36,daily-sun

The Prime Minister said that her party has successfully maintained the confidence, trust and popularity of the masses despite the fact that it is almost impossible to do so with saying in power for such a long period since 2009 till the date.

Referring to 2008 general election, she said that the BNP-Jamaat alliance got only 29 seats while the AL lea grand alliance received the remaining others proving people's perception wrong that the Awami League and BNP are same.

""We have to keep the confidence and trust of the people in Awami League. Our only strength is the trust and confidence of the people and we have no other power,"" she said.

She reminded her party men military dictator Ziaur Rahman had tried his best to break the Awami League.

1056,"Widen tax difference between listed, non-listed firms","A non-significant difference between listed and non-listed companies in the tax waiver facility discourages new companies from coming to the capital market, observed market analysts.

They said that such a situation created a setback for the new investment in the country's stock market.

But that benefit was later cut down to 7.5 percent, which, the market analysts said, had discouraged new investors to get enlisted with the share market.

The listed companies contribute around 80 percent of revenue to the national exchequer.

According to the market analysts and economists, such stagnancy might be overcome by widening the gap in tax waiver between the listed and non-listed firms.

“At one time, the listed companies got a 10 percent waiver on corporate tax. Now, the ratio has dropped to 7.5 percent. So, why does a company come into the regulation of the market?” Prof. Abu Ahmed, a former faculty of Dhaka University Department of Economics, told the Daily Sun.

At present, the tax rate for listed and non-listed companies is 20 percent and 27.5 percent respectively, indicating a gap of 7.5 percentage points.

The economist observed that the government should formulate a prudent policy for attracting new investment as most of the 200 thousand registered companies remain out of the capital market, a major arm of the country's economy.

Bangladesh Merchant Bankers Association (BMBA) President Sayadur Rahman echoed Prof. Abu Ahmed demanding a minimum 15 percent tax gap between the listed and the conventional companies.

“The listed companies get 7.5 percent tax waiver which does not inspire new firms to enlist with the bourses. Besides, corporate tax for merchant banks should be brought down to 25 percent from 37.5 percent to facilitate more institutional investment in the capital market,” Sayadur Rahman, also chairman at Imperial Capital, told Daily Sun.

The merchant banker also suggested a difference between the listed and the conventional companies by bringing down value added tax to 10 percent for stock transactions.

After witnessing a downward trend in the three sessions, stocks on Tuesday rebounded in the Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges as investors remained active on sector-wise issues.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689903/Widen-tax-difference-between-listed-nonlisted-firms,2023-05-18 10:38:38,daily-sun
1057,"Heat wave in Asia made 30 times more likely because of climate change, scientists say","A searing heat wave in parts of southern Asia in April this year was made at least 30 times more likely by climate change, according to a rapid study by international scientists released Wednesday.

Sizzling temperatures of up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) were recorded in monitoring stations in parts of India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Laos last month — which was unusually high for the time of year.

The World Weather Attribution group uses established models to quickly determine whether climate change played a part in extreme weather events. While the studies themselves are not yet peer-reviewed, which is the gold standard for science, they are often later published in peer-reviewed journals.

In Thailand, high temperatures mixed with humidity meant some parts of the country felt above 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit). In India, multiple regions across the country were affected with 13 people dying due to heat at a public event outside India's business capital, Mumbai. The eastern Indian state of West Bengal closed all schools and colleges for a week.

The study found that temperatures were at least 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter in the region because of climate change.

If the global average temperature reaches up to 2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in the late 1800s, the April heatwave could occur every one to two years in India and Bangladesh, the study said. Currently, the world is around 1.1 to 1.2 degrees Celsius (2 to 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times.

""We see again and again that climate change dramatically increases the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, one of the deadliest weather events there are,"" said Friedrike Otto, a senior climate scientist at Imperial College London and one of the study's authors.

""Access to healthcare and to cooling solutions like fans and air conditioners is missing for a lot of the population in this region,"" said Emmanuel Raju, director of the Copenhagen Centre for Disaster Research at the University of Copenhagen and another of the study's nearly two dozen authors.

Raju emphasized that heat affects the poorest people and people whose work requires them to be outside — farmers, street vendors and construction workers — the most.

""It's important to talk about who can cope and adapt to heat,"" he said. ""Many are still recovering from the pandemic, and from past heatwaves and cyclones, which leaves them trapped in a vicious cycle.""

The southern Asian region is considered among the most vulnerable to climate change in the world, according to various global climate studies. But India, the largest country in the region and the most populous in the world is also currently the third highest emitter of planet-warming gases.

Scientists say that drastic measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions immediately is the only solution.

""Heat waves will become more common, temperatures will rise even more and the number of hot days will increase and become more frequent"" if we continue to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, said Chaya Vaddhanaphuti, a professor at the Chiang Mai University in Thailand and a co-author of the study.

Vimal Mishra, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in Gandhinagar who studies the region's climate, acknowledged the importance of studies that help attribute specific weather events to climate change but said more action needs to be taken.

""We should go beyond attribution and talk about how climate change is affecting weather fundamentally and look at how we can develop climate resilience,"" he said.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689902/Heat-wave-in-Asia-made-30-times-more-likely-because-of-climate-change-scientists-say,2023-05-18 10:38:39,daily-sun

1060,"Millions of children at risk in Bangladesh, Myanmar in the aftermath of Cyclone Mocha: UNICEF","The trail of destruction left by Cyclone Mocha in parts of Bangladesh and Myanmar is causing severe disruption to the lives of millions of vulnerable children and families, including many already living in dire conditions, says UNICEF on Wednesday.

Even as the worst of the storm has passed, the risk of landslides remains high, and further dangers, including waterborne diseases, will likely grow in the days ahead.

""Some of the world's most vulnerable children and families are, yet again, at the sharp end of a crisis they didn't create. The areas hit hardest by the storm are home to communities already living through conflict, poverty, instability, and climate and environmental shocks,"" said UNICEF's Executive Director Catherine Russell.

""As we urgently assess and respond to the immediate needs of children in the aftermath of this cyclone, we know with certainty that the best way to save and improve the lives of children and their families is by finding long-term solutions.""

In Bangladesh, home to the world's largest refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, one million Rohingya refugees faced the brunt of the heavy storms, half of them children. The refugee camps rank among the most tightly packed places on earth, exposing children to conditions ripe for disease, malnutrition, neglect, exploitation, and violence. The camps are also prone to mudslides, and children live in fragile temporary shelters.

Cyclone Mocha has tied with 2019's Tropical Cyclone Fani as the strongest storm ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean. Scientists recently found that, while disaster management efforts have reduced the number of deaths during cyclones in recent years, climate change is threatening this progress. They noted that escalating frequency and intensity of storms will pose a far greater risk to Bangladesh in the coming decades.

While Cox's Bazar was spared the eye of the storm, thousands of people have been affected and several temporary shelters, facilities, and infrastructure that refugees have been provided have flooded and left severely damaged due to heavy winds and rains.

UNICEF is on the ground, assessing needs, and providing emergency relief. Together with local partners, UNICEF is prepositioning and deploying supplies in Bangladesh and Myanmar to ramp up our response services, including water and sanitation, child protection, health, nutrition, and education.

By late Sunday, the storm weakened, leaving behind destroyed homes, health facilities, schools, and other critical infrastructure.

Many of the hundreds of thousands of people affected are refugees or internally displaced people (IDPs), living in poorly structured shelters in camps and hard-to-reach areas.

They rely heavily on humanitarian assistance for food, water, health, education, and protection.

The situation is particularly worrisome in Myanmar. More than 16 million people – 5.6 million of them children – including 1.2 million internally displaced people of Rohingya, ethnic Rakhine and other communities, were in the path of the cyclone in Rakhine State, and locations in the north-west including Chin State and Sagaing and Magway Regions.

The areas are low-lying and highly prone to flooding landslides.

Assessments of the extent of the damage in Myanmar are challenging, largely due to interrupted transport and telecommunication services and inaccessibility of some roads due to trees falling and debris.

However, early reports show that children were reportedly among the victims of the storm.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689878/Millions-of-children-at-risk-in-Bangladesh-Myanmar-in-the-aftermath-of-Cyclone-Mocha:-UNICEF,2023-05-18 10:38:40,daily-sun

1063,"Bangladesh relations with Beijing, Moscow don’t influence US-BD ties: State Dept Official","A senior US State Department official has said Washington does not define its relationship with Bangladesh taking into account Dhaka’s ties with Russia, China or any other country.

“US-Bangladesh relationship isn’t defined by China, by Russia and any other country,” US Deputy Assistant Secretary Afreen Akhter told BSS diplomatic correspondent Tanzim Anwar in an exclusive interview this week in the capital.

“Broadly, we see lot of synergies between our two documents, our strategy, and your (Bangladesh’s) outlook. We both are focused on building economic prosperity in the region and through infrastructure, through our substantial development projects,” the senior state department official said.

Bangladesh last month released its IPO envisioning a free, open, peaceful, secure, and inclusive indo-pacific region that appeared Dhaka’s expression its cohesion with the IPS which has been pursuing by the US in the region.

The State department official’s comments came months after US Ambassador in Dhaka Peter Haas said Washington does not force countries to choose sides over relations with other countries and particularly with Beijing as “we don’t expect every country to have the same exact assessment of China as we do”.

Haas, however, said the Russian actions in Ukraine currently appeared as the “most pressing strategic challenge” for the US vision for an “open, interconnected prosperous, secure and resilient Indo-pacific”.

Talking to BSS Akhter pointed out with note of thanks Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s recent joint statement with Japanese premier Fumio Kishida “condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a violation of an International law and the UN charter”.

Indo Pacific Outlook (IPO)

The US diplomat welcomed Dhaka’s announcement of IPO and said the two documents – US’s IPS and Bangladesh’s IPO – share “tremendous amount in common”.

Apart from the US, the other members of QUAD - an informal strategic forum of the US, Australia, India and Japan – welcomed Bangladesh IPO with Indian external affair minister Dr S Jaishankar this week saying “we are glad” about Bangladesh’s Outlook.

Akhtar said Bangladesh’s IPO laid emphasis on “maritime security” issue which was a key focus of the US and the other QUAD partners and “so we will look for opportunities to continue to collaborate on that”.

She said economic growth is a key component of Bangladesh IPO while the US is the top export destination for Bangladesh as well as the top investor in Bangladesh and “so again we really look to build that out in the years to come”.

Security cooperation:

The US official said that the US was currently working “very closely” with Bangladesh government on the remaining elements of General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), a foundational government-to-government agreement that permits greater collaboration.

“We hope that (GSOMIA) will be signed in the coming months,” she said without any elaboration further.

GSOMIA is a reciprocal legally-binding agreement between US and other governments to protecting classified military information regarding their security cooperation.

Akhter said that the US embassy defense attaché in Dhaka was in very regular consultation with concerned Bangladesh authorities on security cooperation.

She said the US planned to provide radar technology in countries throughout the Indo-pacific region to develop a common operating picture in the maritime domain under its Indo-Pacific Maritime Domain Awareness Initiative (IPMDA).

RAB Sanction

The US deputy assistant secretary said Washington was pleased to see “a substantial decrease of extra judicial killings” after its sanction on Bangladesh’s elite anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion (RAB).

“We welcome that decrease (of in extra judicial killing) . . . (but) we need to see a long time sustained trend, positive changes of behavior (in RAB),” she said adding that Washington focused on ensuring accountability, reform and transparency of RAB.

“I would say that with respect to lifting sanctions on the RAB, we need to see long term systemic change for sanctions to be considered to be removed,” the state department official said.

The deputy assistant secretary also said Washington was concerned about the application Bangladesh’s Digital Security and particularly “where the Digital Security Act has been applied”.

Rohingya Issue

The state department official said that her country was working to find out a longer term durable solution to the crisis through repatriation of Rohinyas to Myanmar under the right condition, a task she termed as “difficult and challenging”.

“We believe very firmly that the conditions in Myanmar right now do not warrant a safe voluntary dignified return and so we would oppose any effort to forcibly repatriate individuals to Myanmar,” she added.

Akhter said the US might take more Rohingyas to the USA in future under its third country resettlement initiative which has started last December.

“We started a very small pilot programme to relocate some of the most vulnerable Rohingya refugees to the US . . . we are hoping for increase the number of third country relocation,” she said.

Akhter said the US was the largest donor by far to the Rohingya crisis and regretted that other members of the UN Security Council “have not provided a Dime (as humanitarian support for the Rohingyas)”.

Investment Plans

Akhter said that the US government was giving priority on Bangladesh’s clean energy sector for investment. “We will be looking for opportunities to collaborate with Bangladesh on and looking forward (about energy sector cooperation).”

She said the US private sector’s relationships with Bangladesh was incredibly strong though Bangladesh’s regulatory environment needed to be improved to attract US business.

“Our trade attaché here is working with the government of Bangladesh for making Bangladesh economy more transparent and more attractive for the US private sector investors”.

Besides, Akhter said that the US embassy’s labor attaché here is also working very closely with Bangladesh government on improving labor conditions with respect of union registration and uniform application of the labour laws.

1065,"Prince Harry, Meghan in 'near catastrophic' New York car chase","Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle were involved in a ""near catastrophic car chase"" with paparazzi in New York, a spokesperson for the couple said Wednesday.

But police and even the mayor of New York City, as well as a taxi driver who briefly transported the couple, played down the danger and duration of the reported pursuit.

The episode occurred after Harry, 38, and Meghan, 41, attended an awards ceremony in America's financial capital with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland.

""Last night, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Ms. Ragland were involved in a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi,"" the spokesperson said in a statement emailed to AFP.

""This relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers,"" the spokesperson added.

A source close to the couple said Meghan and Harry were pursued by half a dozen blacked out vehicles with ""unidentified people driving recklessly and endangering the convoy and everyone around them.""

""The chase could have been fatal,"" the source added, claiming a number of possible traffic violations -- including driving on the sidewalk, running red lights and reversing down a one-way street -- were committed.

""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived at their destination and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries, or arrests in regard,"" NYPD spokesman Julian Phillips told AFP.

- Mother's death -

Harry has long had a difficult relationship with the media.

He blames press intrusion for causing the death of his mother in a car crash in a Paris tunnel in 1997 while she was being pursued by paparazzi.

In a US television interview earlier this year he recalled seeing the final photos of her and realizing that the last thing she saw before she died was photographers taking her picture.

Harry and Meghan, an American former TV actress, sensationally quit royal family duties in early 2020 and moved from Britain to the United States, in part because of intense media scrutiny.

The younger son of King Charles III has been involved in several legal cases against British newspaper publishers since moving to California.

Last week the publisher of The Mirror apologized ""unreservedly"" to Harry, who has accused the tabloid of unlawful information gathering.

Harry is also pursuing claims against the publisher of The Sun and the publisher of the Daily Mail. Those cases will be decided later this year.

- 'Hard to believe' -

Harry and Meghan departed the Ms. Foundation for Women ceremony at the Ziegfeld Ballroom in midtown Manhattan, where Meghan received an award, and were heading towards a private residence when they were pursued.

US media reported that the couple got in a taxi outside a police station for part of their journey as they apparently tried to shake off the photographers.

Taxi driver Sukhcharn Singh told the Washington Post that two vehicles followed them.

""I never felt like I was in danger. It wasn't like a car chase in a movie. They were quiet and seemed scared but it's New York -- it's safe,"" he said.

Mayor Eric Adams said he found it ""hard to believe that there was a two-hour high-speed chase"" through the Big Apple, but added that even ""a 10-minute chase is extremely dangerous in New York City.""

The couple's spokesperson said that ""while being a public figure comes with a level of interest from the public, it should never come at the cost of anyone's safety.""

""Dissemination of these images, given the ways in which they were obtained, encourages a highly intrusive practice that is dangerous to all involved,"" said the spokesperson.

Harry carried out several TV interviews this year to promote his best-selling memoir ""Spare,"" which has broken publishing records.

In the book and subsequent interviews, Harry aired a barrage of criticism at other royals, including elder brother Prince William.

He claimed William physically attacked him during an argument about Meghan and also detailed his strained relationship with his father, King Charles.

Harry attended his father's coronation earlier this month without Meghan, who remained in California with the couple's two children. He was not given a formal role in the ceremony.

Harry and Meghan have their own private security team in the US but lost their UK taxpayer-paid protection after they left Britain. They are challenging the move in British courts.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/690028/Prince-Harry-Meghan-in-near-catastrophic-New-York-car-chase,2023-05-18 10:38:42,daily-sun
1066,Netflix says ad-supported plan has nearly 5 mn users,"Netflix on Wednesday wooed marketers with word that its nascent ad-supported plan has grown to nearly five million users globally.

The streaming television star touted its shows, viewer demographics, and more at a virtual ""Upfront"" presentation to advertisers.

""On average, more than a quarter of our sign-ups now choose the ads plan in countries where it's available.""

1068,Farhan Akhtar looks to revive DON franchise; Shah Rukh Khan exits,"Popular Indian action thriller movie franchise DON starring Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, is set to return with its third film but not with Shah Rukh Khan as its lead and the title character.

The director Farhan Akhtar and his team at Excel Entertainment are now looking to reboot the Don franchise with a new lead to play Don 3.0, reports Indian entertainment and lifestyle platform Pinkvilla on Tuesday.

According to the report, Khan is willing to do commercial films that cater to a universal section of the audience, and Don certainly doesn’t fit the bracket of cinema that he is willing to do for the coming few years. “He has conveyed his decision to the stakeholders at Excel,” revealed a source close to the development.

To make the franchise bigger, Farhan and the team had also come up with a unique idea of bringing 3 generations of Don together – Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and a gen-next star – to lay down a platform for the generational shift of Don. “But SRK felt the idea of spinning Don's universe would be gimmicky and hence advised the team about his exit,” the source added.

Farhan meanwhile is working on a new script for Don reboot now. Amitabh Bachchan featured in Don back in 1978. The same was rebooted with Shah Rukh Khan in 2005. And now, come 2024, Farhan is planning to reboot the franchise with a new leading man, Pinkvilla reported.

“The talks are on with a hero who has done two films with Excel in the last decade. He is keen to step into the shoes of Don, but has his reservations too, as the legacy of the franchise and the actors who portrayed Don before can’t be replicated by anyone. Don will be rebooted once one of the younger actors takes up the challenge,” the source signed off.

Recently, the iconic Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan starrer film ‘Pathaan’ got its official theatrical release in Bangladesh on May 12, which is currently storming at the multiplexes in the country. Referred to in the media as the ""Baadshah of Bollywood"" and ""King Khan"", Shah Rukh Khan is currently busy shooting for the much-anticipated Rajkumar Hirani film ‘Dunki’ which is slated for a December 2023 release.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689717/Farhan-Akhtar-looks-to-revive-DON-franchise-Shah-Rukh-Khan-exits,2023-05-18 10:38:43,daily-sun
1069,"South Korean singer Haesoo, 29, found dead, police suspect suicide","New Delhi: South Korean singer Haesoo was found dead at her residence last week. The police discovered a note which is suspected to have been written by the 29-year-old trot singer before her death, reported Naver.

The news of Haesoo's death was announced by her team on May 15. It said, in a statement, that Haesoo died on May 12 and the funeral will be held privately. The team also urged everyone to refrain from spreading false news about the singer. “We express our condolences on the final remaining journey of the deceased,” the statement added.

According to South Korean news channel YTN, Haesoo kicked off her singing career in November 2019.

Last month, K-pop star Moonbin, who was a member of the boy band Astro, passed away. The 25-year-old singer was found dead at his home in southern Seoul. Moonbin's label Fantagio Music confirmed his death in a statement but did not disclose the cause.

“On April 19, Astro member Moon Bin unexpectedly left our world and became a star in the sky,” the Music label tweeted. It asked people to ""refrain from speculative and malicious reports” so that the singer's family could pay their respects in peace.

Moon Bin's death led to an outpour of grief on social media where many expressed disbelief. Moon Bin, who performed as Moonbin, worked as a model and actor before he joined the K-pop boy band Astro. He was also a part of Astro's sub-group named Moonbin & Sanha, which was scheduled to perform at the Dream Concert, one of the largest K-pop joint concerts, in May this year. The band's performance was postponed after the singer's death.

1070,Cannes opens with Johnny Depp's French comeback drama,"The Cannes Film Festival was set for a stormy start on Tuesday, with Johnny Depp making his comeback in the opening film, showing off his French skills as King Louis XV.

The 59-year-old's career has nosedived in Hollywood, despite his victory in a defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard last year that featured bitter domestic violence allegations.

Festival director Thierry Fremaux told reporters he was ""not interested"" in Depp's trial, adding: ""I am interested in Depp the actor.""

Michael Douglas will also attend the opening ceremony to receive an honorary Palme d'Or.

The French Riviera festival, which runs until May 27, includes a slew of hot-ticket premieres, including ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" on Wednesday, the fifth and final outing for Harrison Ford as the whip-cracking archaeologist.

Saturday will see Martin Scorsese present his latest epic, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", alongside stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro.

That day also sees Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore in indie favourite Todd Haynes's ""May December"".

Fremaux said increasing women's representation at the festival was a ""fundamental question"" but ""I refuse congratulations, it is an evolution. We don't look at the gender, we select movies.""

Several Palme laureates are back in competition, including Britain's two-time winner Ken Loach, Japan's Hirokazu Kore-eda and Germany's Wim Wenders.

The jury is led by last year's winner, Sweden's Ruben Ostlund (""Triangle of Sadness""), and also includes Hollywood stars Brie Larson and Paul Dano.

Around a thousand police and security guards are in place for the festival, amid fears of protests linked to President Emmanuel Macron's unpopular pension reforms, with the CGT union even threatening to cut power.

- 'A lot of worries' -

Depp's ""Jeanne du Barry"" has reportedly yet to secure US distribution.

His dialogue in the film is kept to short phrases that help disguise his American accent.

Maiwenn, the French star who directs and plays the lead role, admitted she was worried about the impact of his legal woes.

""The film was shot last summer and he was coming out of his second trial,"" Maiwenn, who goes by a single name, told AFP last week.

""I had a lot of worries. I was wondering: 'what will his image become?'"" she said.

But she faces her own controversies.

In March, a well-known French journalist, Edwy Plenel of Mediapart, lodged a criminal complaint against Maiwenn, accusing her of approaching him in a restaurant, grabbing him by the hair and spitting in his face.

She refused to discuss the ""ongoing case"" with AFP, but admitted the assault in an interview on French TV, without going into details.

Depp was axed from Harry Potter spin-off ""Fantastic Beasts"" following Heard's abuse allegations, but he is a long way from being ""cancelled"".

He has secured a record $20 million deal to remain the face of Dior fragrance, according to Variety last week.

He is also set to direct Al Pacino in a biopic of artist Amedeo Modigliani later this year.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689680/Cannes-opens-with-Johnny-Depps-French-comeback-drama,2023-05-18 10:38:44,daily-sun

1073,'Rs 25 crore demanded from SRK's family': CBI's case against officer,"Mumbai: Actor Shah Rukh Khan's family was threatened that his son Aryan would be framed in a narcotics case unless he paid ₹ 25 crore, according to the FIR filed by the CBI against Sameer Wankhede, former zonal director of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).

Mr Wankhede, who hit headlines after the arrest of Aryan Khan and others in an alleged drug bust on a cruise ship off Mumbai in October 2021, is facing allegations of corruption and criminal misconduct.

Enquiries into the allegations against Mr Wankhede and Ashish Ranjan, then an intelligence officer with NCB, ""could not sufficiently justify their acquired assets as per their declared income"", the FIR says. Mr Wankhede, it adds, has ""not properly explained his foreign visits and had apparently mis-declared the expenditure on his foreign travels"".

The FIR names four accused other than Mr Wankhede. These include Vishwa Vijay Singh and Ashish Ranjan, then senior officers with the NCB, and KP Gosavi and his aide Sanvile D'Souza.

KP Gosavi is the witness in the drugs-on-cruise case whose selfie with Aryan Khan following his arrest, sparking questions on how an individual not employed with NCB was allowed access to the accused.

The CBI's FIR notes that Gosavi ""was allowed to be present in the company of accused persons and even allowed to come to the NCB office after the raid which is against the norms for an independent witness"". ""In this manner, KP Gosavi took the freedom and clicked selfies and recorded the voice note of an accused,"" it adds.

The FIR flags a conspiracy ""to extort a sum of ₹ 25 crore from the family members of the alleged 'accused' Aryan Khan by threatening them of the accusation of offences of possession of Narcotics substances"". ""This amount was finally settled for ₹ 18 crore. A token amount of ₹ 50 lakhs as bribe money was also taken by KP Gosavi and his aide Sanville D'Souza but later a part of this amount of ₹ 50 lakhs bribe money was returned back by them,"" the FIR says.

Many of these allegations were earlier made by former Maharashtra minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik, currently in jail on corruption charges, and Prabhakar Sail, a witness in the drugs-on-cruise case who died of a heart attack last year.

Wankhede was transferred to the Directorate General of Taxpayer Services in Chennai last year. Following the recent CBI raids at his home, he said he ""was being punished for being a patriot"". ""I am getting rewarded for being a patriot, yesterday 18 CBI officials raided my residence and searched it for more than 12 hours while my wife and children were present in the house. They found ₹ 23,000 and four property papers. These assets were acquired before I joined the service,"" he said.

Following his arrest, Aryan Khan spent 22 days in jail before the NCB cleared him of charges, citing a ""lack of sufficient evidence"". Amid the huge uproar, a separate probe was launched into the allegations against Wankhede and his team.

1074,Cannes braces for stars and protests,"The Cannes Film Festival was preparing to roll out the red carpet on Monday for a star-packed edition featuring Harrison Ford, Johnny Depp and Natalie Portman -- but also concerns over protests by French unions.

Some 35,000 people are expected for the festival's 76th edition, which kicks off Tuesday in the French Riviera town and runs to May 27.

Meanwhile, 21 films are competing for the top prize Palme d'Or, including a record seven women directors.

Around a thousand police and security guards are in place for the festival, which has been held under a heightened security alert ever since a wave of terror attacks in France in the 2010s.

This year, organisers face additional worries that recent protests over President Emmanuel Macron's pension reforms will affect the festival.

All protests are banned around the Croisette during the event, local authorities told AFP, adding that this was the same as previous years.

But the CGT union has vowed to make its presence felt -- threatening last month that it would cut power during the festival and announcing a ""fixed"" protest in front of the famed Carlton Hotel on Friday.

The jury is led by last year's Palme d'Or winner, Ruben Ostlund, and also includes Hollywood stars Brie Larson and Paul Dano.

Several Palme laureates are back in competition, including Britain's two-time winner Ken Loach, Japan's Hirokazu Kore-eda and Germany's Wim Wenders.

The opening film is bound to make waves: ""Jeanne du Barry"" is billed as Johnny Depp's comeback film, a period drama in which the controversial star tests out his French skills as King Louis XV.

1075,Cannes 2023: A look at Indian films that will be screened at the film festival,"The 2023 Cannes Film Festival is right around the corner and the Indian cinema is already creating a buzz.

At this year’s festival, several Indian films will be screened including director Anurag Kashyap’s ‘Kennedy’ and actor Rahul Roy’s ‘Agra’. Let’s talk about them in detail ‘Kennedy’

In April, the official Twitter handle of the Cannes Film Festival announced the selection of Anurag Kashyap’s ‘Kennedy’ in the Midnight Screenings section of the festival.

“KENNEDY by Anurag KASHYAP #SeanceDeMinuit / #MidnightScreenings #Cannes2023,” read the post. ‘Kennedy’ stars Sunny Leone, Rahul Bhatt and Abhilash Thapliyal.

Coming from the house of Zee Studios and Good Bad Films, ‘Kennedy’ is essentially a police noir film, by Anurag Kashyap. The film revolves around an insomniac ex-cop, long thought to be dead, but still operating for the corrupt system, and looking for redemption. The film stars Rahul Bhat and Sunny Leone in the lead roles and has been selected for a Midnight Screening at Cannes Film Festival 2023.

Sharing details about it, Kashyap said, “It’s a film and genre I always wanted to explore. It’s more polar than noir, inspired by crime writing of Patrick Manchette and his comic book collaborations with Jacques Tardi, and the cinema of Melville. It’s also a deeply personal crime/police drama and am so grateful to Zee Studios, Shariq and team, Neeraj, Bhumika, my producers Ranjan, Kabir and Kavan, my whole team, my partners in crime Sylver, Kazvin, Prashant who helped me shape it. Rahul Bhat who gave 8 months of his life, Sunny Leone who took on the challenge of it, Mohit Takalkar for taking it on…am just grateful at the moment.”

‘Agra’

‘Agra’ has an ensemble cast headlined by Aashiqui star Rahul Roy, who makes a comeback with this film. It also features Priyanka Bose (actor of the Oscar-nominated film Lion), debut actor Mohit Agarwal, Ruhani Sharma, and veteran actors Vibha Chibber, Sonal Jha, and Aanchal Goswami in pivotal roles.

The film is an exploration of sexual dynamics within a family and the deep dystopian fractures created in modern India that are fast shrinking into pigeon-holed spaces.

‘Ishanou’

Manipuri filmmaker Aribam Syam Sharma’s award-winning film of 1990 ‘Ishanou’ will be screened at Cannes this year.

It has been officially selected for a red-carpet world premiere on May 19, 2023 at the prestigious Cannes Classic section of the Cannes Film Festival 2023.

This restored film becomes the only Indian film to be considered under the Classic Section of the Cannes Film Festival this year, a segment that celebrates restored versions of all-time classics.

1076,Post-pandemic world economy still feeling COVID-19’s sting,"Prospects for a robust global economic recovery remain dim as the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic carry on, according to the UN’s latest World Economic Situation and Prospects report, released on Tuesday.

Risks of a prolonged period of low growth stand, amid stubborn inflation, rising interest rates, and heightened uncertainties, in addition to the ever-worsening impact of climate change, the report found.

“The global community must urgently address the growing shortages of funding faced by many developing countries, strengthening their capacities to make critical investments in sustainable development and helping them transform their economies to achieve inclusive and sustained long-term growth,” he said.

According to the report, the world economy is now projected to grow by 2.3 per cent in 2023 and 2.5 per cent in 2024, a slight uptick in the global growth forecast for 2023, according to the report, which is produced by DESA.

In the United States, resilient household spending has prompted upward revision of the growth forecast to 1.1 per cent in 2023.

Driven by lower gas prices and robust consumer spending, the European Union’s economy is now projected to grow by 0.9 per cent. As a result of COVID-19 related restrictions being lifted, China’s growth in 2023 is now forecast to be 5.3 per cent.

Despite this uptick, the growth rate is still well below the average growth rate in the two decades before the pandemic, of 3.1 per cent.

The least developed countries are forecast to grow by 4.1 per cent in 2023 and 5.2 per cent in 2024, far below the seven per cent growth target set in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Global trade remains under pressure due to geopolitical tensions, weakening global demand and tighter monetary and fiscal policies. The volume of global trade in goods and services is forecast to grow by 2.3 per cent in 2023, well below the pre-pandemic trend.

Inflation remained stubbornly high in many countries even as international food and energy prices fell substantially in the past year. Average global inflation is projected at 5.2 per cent in 2023, down from a two decade high of 7.5 per cent in 2022.

While upward price pressures are expected to slowly ease, inflation in many countries will remain well above central banks’ targets. Amid local supply disruptions, high import costs and market imperfections, domestic food inflation is still elevated in most developing countries, disproportionately affecting the poor, especially women and children.

Rapid tightening of global financial conditions poses major risks for many developing countries and economies in transition. Rising interest rates, coupled with a shift in developed economies from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening, have exacerbated debt vulnerabilities and further constrained public spending options.

Current policy challenges call for stronger cross-border policy cooperation and concerted global actions to prevent many developing economies from becoming trapped in a vicious cycle of low growth and high debt.

Labour markets in the United States, Europe, and other developed economies have continued to show remarkable resilience, contributing to sustained robust household spending. Amid widespread worker shortages and low unemployment rates, wage gains have picked up.

Employment rates are at record high levels in many developed economies with gender gaps narrowing since the pandemic.

Exceptionally strong labour markets are, however, making it harder for central banks to tame inflation. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and central banks in other developed countries have continued to raise interest rates in 2023, but at a slower pace than last year, which saw the most aggressive monetary tightening in decades.

The banking sector turmoil in the United States and Europe has added new uncertainties and challenges for monetary policy.

Although swift and decisive actions by regulators helped contain financial stability risks, vulnerabilities in the global financial architecture and the measures taken to contain them will likely dampen credit and investment growth going forward.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689870/Postpandemic-world-economy-still-feeling-COVID19’s-sting,2023-05-18 10:38:47,daily-sun

The well is capable of yielding 20 to 22 million cubic feet of gas daily which may not sound like much in a country where the daily demand runs into the billions, but in the current situation where the government is having to import LNG cargoes every month from the international spot market.

The government has taken various steps to increase domestic gas production to eliminate the energy crisis in the country. The discovery of the Ilisha-1 gas field in Bhola brings hope amidst the high global fuel gas prices and the crisis.

International company Gazprom of Russia conducted the well drilling based on the BAPEX design and location, which was successfully completed through Drill Stem Test at a depth of 3,436 meters.

BAPEX's General Manager of Geophysical Department, Alamgir Hossain, estimates that initially, 20 to 22 million cubic feet of gas can be available from this well daily, with 180 to 220 BCF of gas reserves.

However, further testing will be conducted to determine the actual production per day. The gas reserves in these wells are 1.7 TCF cubic feet.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689671/3-strikes-for-Ilisha1:-another-drill-test-finds-gas-,2023-05-18 10:38:48,daily-sun

This was agreed at the Second Foreign Office Consultations (FOC) between Bangladesh and Vietnam held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka on Sunday (May 14).

Foreign Secretary Ambassador Masud Bin Momen led the Bangladesh delegation, while a 9-member Vietnamese delegation was led by the Deputy Foreign Minister of Viet Nam Do Hung Viet.

The entire gamut of the bilateral relations, including cooperation in the areas of trade and commerce, investment, energy, halal trade, tourism and culture, education, health, defence and security, agriculture, fisheries and livestock, ICT and telecommunication, direct air link etc. came under discussion.

They also exchanged views on issues of mutual interests in the regional & international arena. Both the sides expressed optimism that the FOC, held after a hiatus of almost six years, would contribute significantly to adding further impetus and momentum to the existing bilateral engagements.

Highlighting the lucrative incentives and facilities offered by Bangladesh for the Foreign Direct Investment, the Bangladesh Foreign Secretary encouraged the Vietnamese business community and entrepreneurs to avail the opportunities, particularly in the Economic Zones of Bangladesh, for mutual benefit.

Both sides stressed the importance of direct air links for facilitating trade, commerce and investment and for accelerating tourism and people-to-people contacts. Both Dhaka and Hanoi agreed to explore the possibilities for initiating direct flights at the earliest.

Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen requested Viet Nam to play a more pro-active role bilaterally and within the ASEAN framework for an expeditious repatriation of the Rohingya people from Bangladesh to their homeland in Myanmar.

He also sought an expeditious inclusion of Bangladesh as a Sectoral Dialogue Partner of ASEAN.

Both Head of delegations recalled with gratitude the historic event of establishment of Diplomatic ties between two countries in 1973.

As this year marks the Golden Jubilee of Diplomatic ties between the two friendly countries, the meeting appreciates the joint celebration of the watershed event with commemorative programmes in Dhaka and Hanoi.

1081,Govt may allow onion import soon: Agriculture Secretary,"The government may allow import of onion anytime soon, said Agriculture Secretary Wahida Akhter.

“The import of onion has been suspended considering the interest of farmers. This year onion production in the country has been more than 34 lakh tonnes. Additionally, there are 18.30 lakh tonnes of onions in stock. Although there is no reason behind increase in onion price this time, we are seeing a hike in onion prices in the market.”

She made the remarks at a meeting held at the conference room of the Ministry of Agriculture at the Secretariat on Sunday afternoon.

In the meeting, the Department of Agricultural Extension presented information on the production, demand and import of onion.

According to the DAE statistics, onion production in the country has increased by more than one million tonnes in the last two years.

This year alone, more than 34 lakh tonnes of onion has been produced in the country.

But due to lack of proper storage or adverse environment, 30-35% of onions are wasted.

At present, the production cost of one kg of local onion is Tk 28-30. In 2021-22, the market price of local onion was low (Tk 30-35) due to open imports.

As the farmers did not get a fair price the Ministry of Agriculture temporarily suspended the import of onion this year to encourage the farmers in onion cultivation, according to the DAE.

Agriculture Ministry Additional Secretary Rabindra Shree Barua, Director General of The Department of Agricultural Extension Badal Chandra Biswas, Director General of the Department of Agricultural Marketing Md Masud Karim and Deputy Secretary of the Extension Wing of the Ministry Munsur Alam Khan were present at the meeting.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689327/Govt-may-allow-onion-import-soon:-Agriculture-Secretary,2023-05-18 10:38:49,daily-sun
1082,'Nothing left' as looting guts Sudan's already crippled economy,"A month ago, Mohsen Abdelrahman owned a small but profitable jewellery store in Khartoum. Now, he has nothing to his name but a broken lock and a hollowed-out shopfront.

Ten days after battles broke out between two rival Sudanese generals, he received a call from the shopkeeper next door to his business saying it had been looted.

""Everything I owned was gone,"" he told AFP, adding that now he just wants ""this war to end, so I can start over.""

There is no end in sight to the conflict pitting the forces of army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan against those of his deputy-turned-foe Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, who commands the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.

But even before the fighting broke out, Sudan was one of the world's poorest countries, brought to its knees by decades of international sanctions under former dictator Omar al-Bashir, as well as rampant corruption and the 2011 independence of South Sudan which held almost all the country's oil.

After a brief respite following Bashir's ouster, a 2021 coup led by Burhan and Daglo saw the international community cut $2 billion of annual aid to the country, slashing 40 percent of its budget.

The economy has been in free fall since, with the government never announcing a 2023 budget but instead boasting that dizzying inflation had recently fallen under 100 percent.

Prior to the ongoing conflict, Khartoum saw signs of economic renewal, with international restaurants and supermarkets stocked with organic food and American goods -- although much of it was smuggled through the Sahel.

But nowadays Khartoum, which is home to five million people, is a city whose shattered windows, gutted shopfronts, pockmarked cars and empty shelves bear witness to the rampant violence and looting.

Khartoum airport, now a shell of its former self, has been shut down since the fighting began on April 15.

Sudan once depended on vital trade coming through Port Sudan on the Red Sea, where now only planes and ships full of fleeing civilians take off, and crucial humanitarian aid trickles in.

Nothing has been spared from the looting, including hospitals, humanitarian organisations, and the abandoned houses of more than 500,000 people who fled the capital for neighbouring towns, or other countries.

Noureddine Adam's mobile phone store was no exception. On the fifth day of the conflict, a lock was broken and his shop was ransacked.

""They didn't leave anything, and now I have nothing left,"" he told AFP.

In addition to having lost their inventory, shop owners and traders like Adam are now saddled with debt, he said.

- Empty silos -

According to a customs official who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity, the Soba container terminal south of Khartoum -- where imports are processed before coming into the capital and other areas -- has been stripped bare.

""It was all products from abroad that had come in and were waiting to be processed, but their importers couldn't come and finish the paperwork because of the war,"" he said.

According to witnesses in Khartoum North, wheat silos at Sayga, Sudan's largest producer of flour, have been emptied out -- a potential disaster for a country where the UN predicts 19 million people could be food insecure within six months.

Khartoum residents have tried to hold out hope, even while sheltering under air strikes and seeing their fleeing neighbours' homes broken into and ransacked.

But Abdeldayem Omar knows his clothing store is gone for good.

""On the third day of the war, a rocket fell on the market,"" he told AFP.

""Some stalls burned to the ground, including mine. Others partially survived the flames, but whatever was left was looted.""

The irony, according to him, is that ""the main police station in the district is headquartered inside the market itself.""

""But the police have completely disappeared, and there's no protection left.""",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689144/Nothing-left-as-looting-guts-Sudans-already-crippled-economy,2023-05-18 10:38:50,daily-sun

“The government has been focusing on renewable energy. Bangladesh has gained significant success in use of renewable energy usages including solar home system, mini-grid and solar-powered irrigation system,” he said while addressing a discussion as chief guest in the capital on Friday.

State Minister Nasrul reiterated the government’s promise to increase allocation for ‘smart energy’ system and developing skilled human resources as well.

He appreciated the mission of European Union for extending support in renewable energy, smart grid and other projects to transform energy sector in Bangladesh.

According to Nasrul, the development agencies have opportunities to work in offshore wind, e-government initiative, electric vehicles and electric charging stations.

For example, he mentioned the names of Bangladesh Power Management Institute and Bangladesh Energy and Power Research Council.

The state minister claimed the cost of fund and acquisition of land have increased in recent times causing a major barrier for flourishing renewable energy in the country.

1084,World's oldest near-complete Hebrew Bible sells for $38 mn,"A Hebrew Bible more than 1,000 years old sold for $38.1 million in New York on Wednesday, setting a record for the most valuable manuscript ever sold at auction.

The Codex Sassoon -- which dates to the late ninth to early 10th century -- is the earliest near-complete Hebrew Bible known to still exist.

The Bible was bought by former US diplomat Alfred Moses on behalf of an American nonprofit that will gift it to the ANU Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, Israel, Sotheby's said.

""The Hebrew Bible is the most influential book in history and constitutes the bedrock of Western civilization. I rejoice in knowing that it belongs to the Jewish People,"" said Moses, an ambassador under president Bill Clinton.

The sale surpassed the $30.8 million that Microsoft founder Bill Gates paid for Leonardo da Vinci's Codex Leicester manuscript in 1994 as the most expensive handwritten document ever sold at auction.

The most expensive historical document remains one of the first prints of the US Constitution, which Sotheby's sold for $43 million in November 2021.

The Codex Sassoon is one of only two codices, or manuscripts, containing all 24 books of the Hebrew Bible to have survived into the modern era.

The manuscript bridges the Dead Sea Scrolls -- which date back as early as the third century BC -- and today's modernly accepted form of the Hebrew Bible.

It is named for previous owner David Solomon Sassoon (1880-1942) who assembled the most significant private collection of ancient Jewish texts in the world.

The manuscript was auctioned for the first time in more than 30 years and had a pre-sale estimate of between $30 million and $50 million.

The Codex Sassoon, which has moved about throughout its history, has only been presented once in the past to the public, in 1982, at the British Library in London, said Orit Shaham-Gover, chief curator of the Museum of the Jewish People.

According to carbon-14 dating, the Codex Sassoon is older and more complete than the Aleppo, written in Galilee in the 10th century and brought to Israel in the 1950s after being found in that Syrian city.

The manuscript is also considered to predate the Leningrad Codex, the oldest surviving copy of the Hebrew Bible text in its entirety, and dated to the early eleventh century.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/690025/Worlds-oldest-nearcomplete-Hebrew-Bible-sells-for-38-mn,2023-05-18 10:38:51,daily-sun
1085,"Melbourne bus crash: School children suffer ""life changing"" injuries","A group of primary school children has suffered traumatic, ""life-changing"" injuries after a horrific bus crash in Melbourne, Australia.

The bus was carrying 45 students when police say it was hit by a truck from behind and rolled on Tuesday afternoon.

The truck driver has been charged with dangerous driving causing serious injury.

Australia has a below-average road safety record compared to other advanced economies. It ranks 20th of out of 36 OECD countries for road fatalities.

Warning: This article contains distressing details

Police said the bus had only just left Exford Primary School, on the western fringes of Melbourne, when the collision occurred.

Children were trapped inside the bus before bystanders - including the truck driver and many of their teachers, who had rushed to the scene - helped emergency responders to free them from the wreckage.

Seven children remain at the hospital in serious conditions, including one in intensive care, the Royal Children's Hospital said.

""It is just distressing, knowing what our kids have been through and I can just imagine their fear,"" principal Lisa Campo told media on Wednesday.

The 52-year-old bus driver was also taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among those who thanked first responders and sent well-wishes to the families involved.

""Any accident is just horrific, the fact that it involves school students just breaks your heart,"" he said.

Superintendent Michael Cruse said the scene of the crash was extremely confronting for all who were there.

""Some of the injuries are life changing [and] this incident was avoidable,"" he said.

The 49-year-old truck driver - who suffered minor injuries - has since been charged with four counts of dangerous driving.

Investigations are ongoing, but Supt Cruse said ""inattention"" would be a key focus, and more charges are likely to be laid.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689883/Melbourne-bus-crash:-School-children-suffer-,2023-05-18 10:38:51,daily-sun
1086,Loafers Lodge: Police suspect arson in deadly New Zealand hostel fire,"New Zealand police have launched a homicide inquiry into a fire at an emergency housing hostel in Wellington, where at least six people were killed.

Officials said up to 20 people were still missing and they were treating the blaze as an act of arson.

Due to the damage, police have not yet been able to confirm the death toll.

However, they warned that number could rise on Wednesday, as a team of investigators was sent into the building after an assessment of the building's integrity.

""Officers will be working to locate and recover those who have lost their lives tragically in this fire,"" Acting Wellington District Commander Dion Bennett told reporters on Wednesday.

""We know there are many people waiting for news of family and friends including residents who escaped the fire and who are keenly waiting for news of their fellow tenants.""

More than 90 people had been accounted for. But authorities have not yet disclosed the identities of the dead or those missing - some of whom might be unaccounted for due to other reasons, they said.

The 92-room hostel was known to house residents from vulnerable and marginalised communities - including those on welfare and disability pensions- as well as workers from the city's main hospital.

Residents said the blaze had begun shortly after midnight local time, (12:30 GMT Monday). Some had crawled through smoke to safety, while others were rescued from the roof by firefighters.

One resident, Tala Sili, said he had jumped from his window to escape the fire which had started on the third floor.

""I was on the top floor and I couldn't go through the hallway because there was just too much smoke so I jumped out the window,"" he told national broadcaster RNZ.

""It smelt like poison,"" he said.

On Wednesday, police were given the all clear to send in a reconnaissance search team for the first time, after the building's rooftop collapse.

""This scene examination will be an extensive and methodical process, and we expect it to take some time - likely several days,"" Mr Bennett said.

Loafers Lodge Hostel had been designated by New Zealand's Ministry of Social Development in 2011 as an emergency accommodation provider.

The government said on Tuesday that contract had ended. However the hostel is still part of a wider but informal network of temporary lodging.

Homelessness charities in the city have confirmed that some of their previous clients had found lodging there.

New Zealand is in the midst of a housing crisis brought on sky-high private property prices and rents and a shortage of state housing.

Official figures show that as of February more than 3,300 households live in emergency housing.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689875/Loafers-Lodge:-Police-suspect-arson-in-deadly-New-Zealand-hostel-fire,2023-05-18 10:38:52,daily-sun

1091,Bashundhara gifts bicycle to meritorious schoolgoer,"During childhood, Bithi used to sit in front of her father’s bicycle. Back then she studied at a primary school. She could feel her father’s tireless efforts and poverty to run the family. Sitting on the bicycle, Bithi imagined that she would get a good job when she grew up and help her father run the family.

She once learned to ride a bicycle. After completing her primary, she enrolled in the secondary school. Bithi Rani Mahanta shines like a light in a family with sea of problems. She does very well in her studies. Her teachers take good care of her and waived her tuition fees. Despite poverty and hunger, she continued her study.

Bithi is now a 10th grader while Bikram in seventh standard. Bithi’s SSC exam is approaching ahead. It is important for Bithi and her brother to go to school on a regular basis. Both of them are meritorious students. Two siblings fight almost every day over going to school as their van driver father Bishnu Chandra Mahanta cannot afford another bicycle.

Ignoring all hardships and poverty, Bithi has secured the first place in this year’s annual examination as well. Bithi Rani Mahanta is the daughter of Bishnu Chandra Mahanta and Brihothi Rani Mahanta of Nabanidas Manakasha village under Gangachara upazila of Rangpur. Their family consists of van driver father, housewife mother and two young siblings.

Bishnu, the only breadwinner of the family, is trying to turn the wheel of their fortune by driving a van. It is difficult for all the members of the family to eat thrice a day with the money he earns. In such a situation, it is almost impossible for Bishnu to finance the education of his daughter Bithi and son Bikram. However, he wants to make his children well educated. Bithi studies science at class 10 in Gangachara Government Model High School. Her younger brother Bikram is a class seven student of the same school. Every morning, Bithi tries to go to school, four kilometers from her home, on a broken bicycle with her brother on the back.

Kaler Kantho Editor-in-Chief Imdadul Haq Milan was present at a programme organised by Shuvosangho in Gangachra recently. At one stage of standing in the field and talking to the members of Shuvosangho, he saw a girl coming to the event with a bicycle and taking out it to go home. He intercepted the girl and talked to her. The girl told her name, level of education, address, and other details of her life.

During the conversation, Milan, also a renowned author of the sub continent, came to know how Bithi is struggling to continue her studies at this tender age. He immediately decided that Bashundhara Group will stand by Bithi. With the help of Shuvosangho friends, he inquired about Bithi’s family.

“Now my problem for a cycle is over. Besides, I am very happy to know about regular scholarship. Today, sir (Milan) gave me Tk 2,000. Now, there is no obstacle to fulfilling my dreams. I cordially thank the Bashundhara Group. I am also a member of Shuvosangho. I want to be a good human being and a good volunteer as well. My dream is to grow up and stand by the hapless people,” said delighted Bithi.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689159/Bashundhara-gifts-bicycle-to-meritorious-schoolgoer,2023-05-18 10:38:54,daily-sun
1092,Shuvosangho launches 7th school in Gangachara of Rangpur,"Under patronage of Bashundhara Group, volunteer platform Shuvosangho has launched its seventh school in Gangachara upazila of Rangpur district.

""We had to walk five kilometers to go to school. We could not go to school because of water. If there was no water, we needed to walk to school through mud. We were all like this,” said Joynal, a beneficiary of the school.

Shuvosangho School opened in the area on May 1 under patronage of the Bashundhara Group. Noted litterateur Imdadul Haq Milan recently inaugurated the school as the chief guest.

Gangachara upazila land office’s assistant commissioner Nayan Kumar Saha, model police station’s inspector Mamtazul Islam, Laxmitari Union Parishad chairman Abdullah Al Hadi, among other dignitaries of the area, were present on the occasion.

A total of 50 students are studying in two classes in Shuvosangho School of which 26 students in pre-primary and 24 in class one. Children and parents are very happy to have a new school in the village.

The char started with 40 houses is popularly known as Chalishsala Char. Currently, more than hundred families live in this remote area. The only occupation of the people here is agriculture. During the rainy season, you have to go by boat and during the dry season, you have to walk or ride a horse-cart across the sand to reach this char.

People here have not got electricity connection yet. In the evening, the lights of Kupibaati are lit. This char looks like an island from a distance. No touch of modernity was needed.

After inaugurating the school, Imdadul Haq Milan said Bashundhara Group, the largest industrial conglomerate in the country, has been working for the wellbeing of the country and people.

“The company is conducting different humanitarian activities across the country through Shuvosangho. Bashundhara Group Chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan has directed to build schools for underprivileged children in every corners of Bangladesh. We are working to empower poor women through Shuvosangho. We are establishing Shuvosangho School with the concept that children should not be deprived of the light of education,” he said.

The noted litterateur mentioned that the Shuvosangho School is the seventh institutions from the volunteers’ platform to send lights of education to underprivileged ones.

“We have planned to set up Shuvosangho School in each upazila of the country gradually. We will distribute educational materials including books free of cost to the students. In this char, the school activities will continue by constructing temporary structures at the initial stage. At some point, permanent infrastructure will be built,” added Milan.

Maina Begum, a 64 year-old villager, has appreciated Shuvosangho for setting up a school in the area where young boys and girls were struggling for education.

""Almighty Allah will bless you. Our children will be able to go to school. The older children do not want to go to school because the school is far away. I will send them to this school. I have ten boys and girls. None of them are able to go to school,” she said.

Mominul Islam, the father of four children, said, ""My children have not been able to learn because of the lack of school. They had to walk a long distance to go to school. Now, the kids won’t suffer anymore,”

Lakshmitari union parishad chairman Abdullah Al Hadi said the distance from this char to the primary school is about five kilometers.

“It is difficult for children to go to school from here. During the rainy season you have to go by boat and during the dry season you have to walk on the beach. So, at one point, children stopped going to school. Now, everyone will get an opportunity to study,” he said expressing gratitude to Bashundhara Group and Shuvosangho.

Gangachara upazila land office’s assistant commissioner Nayan Kumar Saha said the Shuvosangho School funded by Bashundhara Group is a great initiative.

“We will support this school from the upazila administration,” he said.

Shuvosangho director Zakaria Zaman said school now offers education for two classes of children. “Now, a teacher is operating the school. The number of teacher and classes will increase soon,” he said.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689158/Shuvosangho-launches-7th-school-in-Gangachara-of-Rangpur,2023-05-18 10:38:55,daily-sun
1093,Bashundhara rescues children from abyss of illiteracy in remote chars,"Chill penury and communication disruptions repressed potentials of Zishan, Zidan, Salma, Mariam and Rabiul. These children were deprived of their right to education. Like many others, they used to go to agricultural fields or markets to earn money and support families. The area lacked nearby school with parents reluctant to send their children to remote places for study. Now, the children are very happy to get Shuvosangho School established under the financial support of the Bashundhara Group, the country’s largest industrial conglomerate.

The whole char is going to turn a study hub due to regular presence of children in the school.

Shuvosangho, a social welfare organisation of the Bashundhara Group’s vernacular daily Kaler Kantho, established the school to spread light of education in the remote char area.

Carrying two bundles of books, Redwan Talal, Mizanur Rahman and Lutfor Rahman of Shuvosangho moved from Galachipa sadar to Banyatoli ghat by motorcycle. Their destination was a char which required crossing of Tentulia river. The sky was cloudy and river tumultuous. However, the inclement weather could not deter them from sending the books to the children. The little students of the Shuvosangho school were waiting for the new books. They boarded a drawler which was kept ready at the Banyatoli ghat. Reaching Charkajal ghat, they hired an auto-rickshaw to go to Char Agusti Mujib Kella which is 17km away. They moved westward from the WAPDA embankment at Gazi market and saw a signboard of the Shuvosangho school. A tin-shed structure of the school is just a few yards off. Little students were waiting for new books. No sooner had Shuvosangho team reached the school than the students approached to them. Many guardians accompanied their children. Later, the children sat in queue and received the books. Their pleasure knew no bounds. They stood beside schoolteacher Sahina Akter to pose for photo.

On May 2, 2023, the 7th Shuvosangho school started its journey with 35 students through distribution of books. Md Mizanur Rahman, president of Charbiswash unit of Shuvosangho, presided over the book distribution ceremony which was attended by social worker Abu Sayem Gazi, Redwan Talal, Lutfor Rahman Awlad, Ashim Mandal, Md Jewel and Mahinor Hossain.

Char Agusti village consists of 300 families which are dependent on fishing and other humble jobs. The village is marked by poverty, illiteracy and child marriage. The girls are married at the age of 13-14. The boys go to fishing or agricultural works along with their parents. The whole char was devoid of school. Given the circumstances, the Bashundhara Group moved to spread light of literacy. The school was established with financial support of the largest business conglomerate of the country. Shuvosangho school started its journey not only to boost literacy but also confidence, joy and self-dignity. The parents often visit the school to know update of their kids. The school pushes joy of children to new heights.

Sathi, mother of student named Salma, said “Earlier, I left the village for Dhaka for livelihood. After some years, I came back. My daughter was not admitted to any government school for being distant. However, Shuvosangho school is located at our doorstep. Now, my daughter (Salma) will go to school every day.”

Md Shahidul Islam, a day labourer of the village, said “I lost my elder son who drowned in nearby water-body. My younger son is now six years old. I was afraid of sending him to any remote school. Now, Shuvosangho has facilitated risk-free study of my child.”

Like Salma, Zishan, Zidan and Mariam, 35 children are going to school every day, fighting inclement weather and other adversities. Many children of the village were aloof from study for not having nearby school and complicated communications. Although some children were admitted to distant school, they did not join classes and examinations. These children used to spend an idle time at home. The communication is comparatively easier in summer than the rainy season. Abu Sayem Gazi, a social worker, extended logistic support to Shuvosangho in establishing the school.

“The village was in the abyss of darkness for lack of literacy since long. Now, light of education sweeps the neighborhood. It was a longstanding dream of my father and me to establish a school. Such dream has been materialised with support of Bashundhara Group and Shuvosangho. This noble initiative will be remembered by the villagers forever. I will look after the school like my child. My support will be available if and when needed. Besides, I will ensure enrollment of all children of the village in the school.”",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689123/Bashundhara-rescues-children-from-abyss-of-illiteracy-in-remote-chars,2023-05-18 10:38:55,daily-sun
1094,2 army men killed in KNA attack in Bandarban,"Two soldiers of Bangladesh Army have been killed and two officers injured in an ambush and explosion by armed terrorists of Kuki-Chin National Army (KNA) in Ruma upazila in Bandarban.

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) confirmed the matter and issued a press release on Wednesday stating that the attack was carried out by the Kuki-Chin National Army (KNA), a separatist organisation in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), around 2:00pm on Tuesday.

After receiving a piece of information, a patrol team of army led by Major Manowar from Sungsungpara Army camp conducted a drive at Jarulchhari Para on Tuesday.

When they reached near a water fountain at Jarulchharib around 1:55pm, the armed KNA terrorists detonated improvised explosive device (IED) and started firing indiscriminately targeting the army personnel, leaving two officers and two soldiers injured.

The injured army personnel were airlifted to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in Chattogram, where two soldiers succumbed to their injuries. The injured army officers were undergoing treatment at the hospital. The ISPR media release further said the KNA has been trying to create a chaotic environment through criminal activities in the deep forests of Ruma, Rowangchhari and Thanchi upazilas of Bandarban.

Chief of Army Staff General SM Shafiuddin Ahmed expressed his deep condolences at the unwarranted death of the soldiers and extended his sympathy to the bereaved family members.

Earlier in March this year, KNA members opened firing suddenly on an army patrol team that killed master warrant officer Nazim Uddin and injured two soldiers.

Members of the KNA armed with heavy weapons are also challenging the security forces in CHT.

Earlier, the law enforcement agencies raided the hideout of KNF and arrested several members of new militant group Jamaatul Ansar Fil Hindal Sharaqqiya. The law enforcement agencies also informed media that many militants from the plain land used to take training at that hideout.

The KNF is made up of people from six small ethnic groups, namely Bom, Mro, Lusai, Khumi, Khyang and Pangkhua. They consider themselves the original inhabitants of the CHT.

At the same time, they consider the Chakma, Marma and Tripura communities to be belonging to the Myanmarese and Indian ethnic groups and outsiders.

This is why the KNF members are hostile towards regional groups like Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS) and UPDF.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/689913/2-army-men-killed-in-KNA-attack-in-Bandarban,2023-05-18 10:38:55,daily-sun

1096,A house that speaks of nation’s pride and pain,"A photograph sometimes can depict a situation so perfectly, which even thousands of words cannot. This lone photo bears the testimony of the nation’s pride and pain.

In the photograph, it is shown that how Sheikh Hasina, the luckless daughter of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, found their Dhanmondi-32 house in Dhaka locked upon her return to country on May 17, 1981 ending her six-year in exile. Her entry into their house was subject to permission from the military authority.

house was under the army authority until June 10, 1981. Military ruler Ziaur Rahman didn’t allow Sheikh Hasina or any member of Bangabandhu family to enter the house till his death.

Consequently, on the day of her return, Sheikh Hasina had to arrange prayer session on the road outside the house. It was a sheer cruelty and flagrant violation of human rights. She couldn’t seek justice for the brutal killing of her father and family members due to Indemnity Act passed in the parliament in a bid to protect the killers permanently. Moreover, the homeless daughter of Bangabandhu was barred from entering her only abode in Dhaka.

Now, numerous human rights activists and organisations are seen protesting different incidents accusing the government’s various bodies of violating human rights but during that time, they didn’t show minimum sympathy to Bangabandhu’s daughters. These ‘self declared human rights defenders’ had turned their eyes blind and remained mum in this regard.

A few days later, the house constructed on loan from the House Building Finance Corporation (HBFC) was auctioned as the installments of around Tk 12,000 were not paid. Sheikh Hasina had paid the money to get the house back.

The Dhanmondi-32 house was not merely a residence of a national leader. Since Bangabandhu and his family members had started living in the house on October 1, 1961, it turned into the centre of Bangalees’ nationalistic struggle. Bangabandhu took all policy decisions of Awami League from the drawing room of this house after discussing with his colleagues. He gave all instructions to the mass people gathered in front of the house through a hand mike from its balcony.

This house is a national asset and it cannot be compared to any structure. Feeling the historic importance of the house, Bangabandhus’s two daughters declared that this house would be turned into a museum.

Despite having no shelter in the city, they made the house as ‘Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Memorial Museum’, which reminds Bangalees of their most proud moments and painful chapter of national life, so that they can get inspiration to uphold the spirit of independence and take lessons to turn around from the most difficult situation in life.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/689915/A-house-that-speaks-of-nation’s-pride-and-pain,2023-05-18 10:38:56,daily-sun
1097,323 extremists to surrender to RAB,"Some 323 members of several outlawed parties, including Purba Banglar Communist Party (Lal Pataka) and Purba Banglar Sarbahara Party, are going to return to normal life by formally surrendering to Rapid Action Battalion (RAB).

They will turn up at a programme to be held at a Sirajganj stadium on May 21. They will also surrender 200 firearms to the elite force.

ANM Imran Khan, assistant director (Legal and Media) of RAB, on Wednesday told the Daily Sun that some 294 members of Purba Banglar Communist Party (ML, Lal Lataka), 21 of Purba Banglar Sarbahara Party and eight of Purba Banglar Communist Party (Janajuddha) will surrender by laying down their arms.

Of them, 181 are from Pabna district, 74 from Tangail, 53 from Rajbari, 11 from Sirajganj, two from Meherpur and one each is from Bogura and Kushtia.

The RAB officer said members of the outlawed organisations used to carry out their activities mainly in northeastern and southeastern regions of the country.

After the surrender, the 323 outlaws will be rehabilitated in different ways so that they can lead a normal life, he said.

Once the northeastern and southeastern regions were called ‘bloody region’ as murders, abductions, robberies and burglaries were everyday affairs there.

Commander Khandaker Al Moin, director (Legal and Media) of RAB, said they will arrange employments for the 323 members who are going to surrender to the elite force.

A pilot programme named ‘Udoyer Pathe’ has been taken to make the female members of 30 extremists’ families self-dependent by providing them with training in handicrafts.

There is also a plan to give land to the landless of those who are going to return to normal life.

Earlier, some 405 members of 50 robbery gangs of the Sundarbans surrendered to RAB with 650 firearms and 32,207 bullets, and they returned to normal life.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina provided them with cash and other assistance.

Some 102 houses, 90 groceries with goods, 228 cattle, 12 fishing boats and eight trawlers have so far been given to the bandits who surrendered.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/689922/323-extremists-to-surrender-to-RAB,2023-05-18 10:38:56,daily-sun
1098,"Ganatantra Mancha detaches itself from BNP, plans solo protests","The opposition alliance, Ganatantra Manch, announced separate movement programmes, distancing themselves from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).

The Manch, a coalition of seven opposition parties, is reportedly displeased with BNP's inability to finalize a joint declaration of movement against the current government.

The Ganatantra Manch, meanwhile, has outlined a 14-point demand for their movement. Despite having similar agendas, the two parties have seen relations sour, causing a cessation of their simultaneous movements since last month.

Ganatantra Manch coordinator, Saiful Huq, addressed a press conference at the Sanghati Auditorium in Segun-bagicha, outlining the party's movement plans.

These include a foot march in the Dhaka south city area on May 23, starting from the Jatiya Press Club and ending at Bahadur Shah Park. Similar protests are scheduled in the Dhaka north city area on May 28, and a road march from Dhaka to Dinajpur from June 4 to 7.

Huq, who also serves as the General Secretary of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Bangladesh, accused the ruling party and the government of planning another 'farcical' election. He alleged ongoing repression and oppression, including arrests of opposition members and the propagation of false cases and harassment.

The leftist politician also dismissed the possibility of an election-time government formed with allies of the ruling party, a notion recently hinted at by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. He claimed such an arrangement would be unacceptable to the public.

The Ganatantra Manch leader also expressed concern over the withdrawal of additional security for foreign diplomats, saying it could risk diplomatic ties and impact the country adversely.

Adding to this sentiment, Nagorik Oikya convener,

Mahmudur Rahman Manna, criticized the Prime Minister's comment on the formation of the election-time government with her political allies. He insisted the current government must step down before any interim government is formed.

Amid these developments, the BNP has scheduled countrywide rallies on May 19, 20, 26, and 27 to push their 10-point demand, which includes holding the next polls under a caretaker government.

The party also held foot march programme in Dhaka north city and south units on May 17.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/689923/Ganatantra-Mancha-detaches--itself-from-BNP-plans-solo-protests,2023-05-18 10:38:57,daily-sun

1100,UN chief urges no-use nuclear weapons policy,"NEW YORK: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday urged leaders attending the upcoming Group of Seven summit to commit to a nuclear weapon no-use policy and voiced his concern about the possible weaponisation of artificial intelligence, reports Kyodo News.

Speaking to a group of reporters at the UN Headquarters in New York, Guterres said it's time for nuclear weapons states to declare they will not use the armaments in any circumstance.

The leaders of the G7 industrial states -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States plus the European Union -- are set to begin their three-day meeting on Friday.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who represents a district in Hiroshima, one of two cities devastated by a nuclear weapon in the closing stages of World War II in 1945, has said he seeks a world free of nuclear weapons.

At the G7 summit, Guterres is expected to take part in working sessions on climate change and the reform of global financial systems. He is also expected to meet with Kishida on the sidelines of the event.

Guterres visited Hiroshima as UN secretary general for the first time in August 2022, when he commemorated the 77th anniversary of the first atomic bomb attack.

Guterres recalled that on his past visits to the city, he was impressed by the courage (and) the resilience of the hibakusha, referring to the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence are also expected to be brought up at the summit.

The UN chief voiced his concern about the possible weaponisation of artificial intelligence, expressing unease specifically about their use in arms systems.

The idea that we will have, one day, arms systems without any human agency is totally unacceptable, he said.

He said that even though artificial intelligence will not be easy to regulate, countries should agree to define red lines in their development. Even the entrepreneurs that are in the frontline of the developments of A.I. recognise that we need to put some order in the system.

On the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Guterres expressed his doubts about the possibility of fruitful peace negotiations at present, adding the fallout from the war is being felt around the world, especially in the price of food.

On a UN-brokered deal also involving Russia and Turkey that enables Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea, Guterres said he expected the agreement to be renewed before it expires Thursday.

Russia has threatened not to extend the agreement over issues concerning its export of food and fertilizers.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/689925/UN-chief-urges-nouse-nuclear-weapons-policy,2023-05-18 10:39:01,daily-sun

He made this call during a visit to 'Pabna Diabetic Association' followed by an exchange of views this morning on the third day of his four-day visit to his home district Pabna for the first time as the country’s head of state.

The people are the source of all power, the president said adding We will resist all the evil forces that are creating obstacles in the way of Bangladesh’s progress and will not give them any chance to raise their heads.

Only then, the valiant freedom fighter said, there won’t be no hurdle in building a Bangladesh earned independence with high hopes under the leadership of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Referring to the election, he said, According to the law, there will be an impartial election under an independent election commission.

The President said, at present, there is no chance of any election to be held under an unelected government. The national election will be held according to the constitution.

The President requested all political parties to participate in the election resolving their conflicts through negotiation and compromise.

Shahabuddin said Bangladesh is at the peak of development today. Bangladesh proudly stands with its head high in the comity of nations today as the government has brightened its image and improved the condition of the people.

1102,"Millions of children at risk in Myanmar, Bangladesh: UNICEF","The trail of destruction left by Cyclone Mocha – which tore through parts of Bangladesh and Myanmar on May 14 – is causing severe disruption to the lives of millions of vulnerable children and families, including many already living in dire conditions.

Even as the worst of the storm has passed, the risk of landslides remains high, and further dangers, including waterborne diseases, will likely grow in the days ahead, said a media release of the UNICEF on Wednesday.

""Some of the world's most vulnerable children and families are, yet again, at the sharp end of a crisis they didn't create. The areas hit hardest by the storm are home to communities already living through conflict, poverty, instability, and climate and environmental shocks,"" said UNICEF's Executive Director Catherine Russell.

The situations particularly worrisome in Myanmar. More than 16 million people – 5.6 million of them children – including 1.2 million internally displaced people of Rohingya, ethnic Rakhine and other communities, were in the path of the cyclone in Rakhine State, and locations in the north-west, including Chin State and Sagaing and Magway Regions. The areas are low-lying and highly prone to flooding landslides.

Assessments of the extent of the damage in Myanmar are challenging, largely due to interrupted transport and telecommunication services and inaccessibility of some roads due to trees falling and debris.

In Bangladesh, home to the world's largest refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, one million Rohingyas faced the brunt of the heavy storms, half of them children. The refugee camps rank among the most tightly packed places on earth, exposing children to conditions ripe for disease, malnutrition, neglect, exploitation, and violence. The camps are also prone to mudslides, and children live in fragile temporary shelters.

Cyclone Mocha has tied with 2019's Tropical Cyclone Fani as the strongest storm ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean.

1105,Eight die in Italy flash flood,"CESENA: Eight people died and thousands were evacuated from their homes after heavy rains caused devastation across Italy's northern Emilia Romagna region, while this weekend's Imola Grand Prix was cancelled, reports AFP.

The city is on its knees, devastated and in pain, said Gian Luca Zattini, the mayor of Forli, a city near Bologna where three people were confirmed dead earlier Wednesday. It's the end of the world.

Two of the bodies in Forli were recovered by divers on Wednesday morning, as part of a huge rescue effort involving emergency services and the armed forces.

Emilia Romagna, one of Italy's richest regions, had already been hit by heavy rain just a fortnight ago, causing floods that left two dead.

This time, around 50 centimetres (20 inches) of rain fell within 36 hours in Forli, Cesena and Ravenna -- around half the normal annual rainfall, a situation with few precedents, Italy's Civil Protection Minister Nello Musumeci said.

It is still a very critical situation, he told reporters, adding that while the rain was still falling, it was expected to lighten during the day.

The flooding caused the cancellation of the Formula One Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, which had been set for on Sunday in Imola.

It would not be right to put further pressure on the local authorities and emergency services at this difficult time, they said.

Regional President Stefano Bonaccini said Emilia Romagna had been hit like an earthquake.

Rescue workers had worked through the night to save children, the elderly and the disabled from the rising waters.

We're scared, this time we're scared, said Simona Matassoni, the owner of the Hotel Savio in Cesena, which has so far escaped flooding.

I was born here, I've seen lots of full rivers, but never anything like this, she told AFP by telephone on Wednesday morning, adding that it was still raining.

At the moment we're crossing our fingers... but another flood is expected, so who knows (what will happen).

Some 3,000 people had been evacuated from their homes in Bologna, while the mayor of Ravenna said some 5,000 people were being evacuated as a precaution. Around 50,000 people were without electricity.

Twenty-one rivers in the region had broken their banks between Tuesday and Wednesday, while 36 local authorities reported flooding and 48 reporting landslides.

The civil protection agency urged maximum caution, as mayors warned people to stay on high ground.

In Forli, an AFP photographer saw people in a state of shock as they fled on Tuesday night through floodwaters in the dark in their bare feet.

Images showed streets transformed into rivers, and firemen moving people to safety in rubber dinghies.

Elsewhere, muddy waters rushed at great speed under the arches of the covered walkways in Bologna, while locals in Cesena swam down a road to rescue a three-year-old child.

We absolutely must not lower our guard, Cesena mayor Enzo Lattuca said on Facebook.

Residents must not under any account go into basements or cellars, and should stay out of ground floors if possible, he said.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, on her way to the G7 summit in Japan, tweeted her support for those affected and said the government was ready to intervene with the necessary aid.

1107,IPL giants Mumbai on shaky ground in play-off race,"The IPL is hotting up with seven teams still in the hunt for play-off spots after five-time champions Mumbai Indians suffered a shock loss to Lucknow.

Defending champions Gujarat Titans are the only franchise to have booked one of the four play-off places, with the Delhi Capitals and Sunrisers Hyderabad now out of contention.

""We didn't play well enough to win. There were moments we didn't win. Unfortunate but we need to keep our heads high,"" Mumbai captain Rohit Sharma said after the defeat.

Rohit, who led Mumbai to titles in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020, said: ""We have to come out and win that game (against Hyderabad on Sunday).""

The top two teams will play the first qualifier, with the winner heading straight to the final in Ahmedabad on May 28 and the loser playing the winner of the ""eliminator"" between teams three and four in the second qualifier.

Lucknow, who made their IPL debut alongside Hardik Pandya's Gujarat last year, have had a hot-and-cold season but a better run rate than Mumbai has kept them in contention for the top four even if they lose their final group game.

Four-time winners Chennai Super Kings, led by M.S. Dhoni -- who is believed to be playing his final season -- looked like sailing into the next round but a shock defeat to Kolkata Knight Riders kept them waiting.

Other teams in contention include Royal Challengers Bangalore, led by Faf du Plessis, as well as the Rajasthan Royals, the Punjab Kings and Kolkata.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689865/IPL-giants-Mumbai-on-shaky-ground-in-playoff-race,2023-05-18 10:39:23,daily-sun
1108,Djokovic sees off Norrie to reach Italian Open quarter-finals,"Novak Djokovic eased into the Italian Open quarter-finals on Tuesday after breezing past Cameron Norrie although there was tension with the Briton after the top seed was hit by a smash.

While Djokovic dispatched Norrie 6-3, 6-4, Monte Carlo Masters winner Andrey Rublev and home hope Jannik Sinner both crashed out in Rome.

It will be a rematch of last year's Paris Masters final, when the 20-year-old Dane won his first Masters 1000 title by beating Djokovic in a thrilling match.

""Even though he's really young, I know his game quite well. He's been on the tour now for last few years playing some great tennis, particularly in the last I would say six to eight months,"" said Djokovic.

""He's in very good form and I look forward to a challenge. I think it's going to be a very physical match.""

Djokovic is gunning for a seventh title on clay in Rome and his chances have been made a little easier by the shock elimination of Carlos Alcaraz on Monday.

Alcaraz, who won two consecutive tournaments at Barcelona and Madrid, will take world number one spot from Djokovic on May 22 but it is the 22-time Grand Slam champion who could go into Roland Garros with yet another title under his belt.

The 35-year-old then took the second set to 2-1 with a break, but in the next game Norrie broke back while angering Djokovic with a smash which hit him on the back of his left leg.

Norrie had the whole court to put the ball away as Djokovic had given up on the point and was walking back to the service line.

- Bringing the fire -

The Briton raised his hand to apologise but at the changeover after Norrie moved to 3-2, Djokovic gave him another long stare as he passed him.

And after Djokovic sealed victory with his second match point he gave Norrie a cursory handshake at the net, while avoiding eye contact and without exchanging a single word with his dispatched opponent.

Djokovic later explained that he had been irritated by Norrie's on-court behaviour since the start of the match, doing ""things that we players know in the locker room it's not fair play"".

""He's very nice guy off the court, so I don't understand this kind of attitude on the court, to be honest. But it is what it is. He brought the fire, and I responded to that,"" said Djokovic.

""I'm not going to allow someone behaving like this just bending my head. I'm going to respond to that.

""That's all it is. What happens on the court, we leave it on the court, and we move on.""

Third seed Daniil Medvedev came through 6-2, 7-6 (7/3) against Alexander Zverev, Casper Ruud dispatched Laslo Djere, and Croatian Borna Coric prevailed in three sets over Fabian Marozsan, the Hungarian outsider who shocked Carlos Alcaraz in the third round.

Fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Lorenzo Sonego 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) in a third-round match which was suspended on Monday due to the rain to set up a meeting with another Italian, Lorenzo Musetti.

Rublev, seeded six, was upset 7-6 (7/5), 4-6, 6-3 by the world's 101-ranked player, German qualifier Yannick Hanfmann.

And Italian eighth seed Sinner was sent packing by Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo 6-7 (3/7), 6-2, 6-2.

In the women's draw, Iga Swiatek took her Rome winning streak to 14 matches with a 6-3, 6-4 success over Donna Vekic.

World number one Swiatek will take on Elena Rybakina in the quarter-finals after coming through the toughest match of her tournament so far.

1109,Inter win Milan derby to reach Champions League final,"Inter Milan reached their first Champions League final for 13 years as Lautaro Martinez's sole goal of the match gave them a 3-0 aggregate win against AC Milan on Tuesday.

Inter will undoubtedly be the underdogs against either Real Madrid or Manchester City in Istanbul on June 10, but the way they managed both legs of this all-Milan tie suggests they will be hard to beat.

Martinez, Inter's captain, hailed the cohesion of his team over the two matches against their city rivals.

""What counts is the squad. I experienced it at the World Cup (with Argentina),"" he said.

""It makes it easy if you have a united squad with everyone pulling in the same direction. It means you get to play these very important matches in the best possible way.""

He added: ""After winning the World Cup and experiencing what is the pinnacle for a player I knew we could reach this final, and we did it.""

His goal effectively killed off the tie.

- Lukaku spark -

Maignan then superbly dropped to his knees to collect Edin Dzeko's glancing header from Hakan Calhanoglu's pacy free-kick.

Lukaku's introduction in the second half proved the spark that Inter needed to extend their lead.

Absent for much of the season with injuries and with a damaged reputation following a disastrous World Cup with Belgium, Lukaku has slowly worked his way back to his best.

The forward on loan from Chelsea immediately caused problems in the Milan defence and created Martinez's goal to guarantee their place in their first Champions League final since the last time they won European club football's biggest prize under Jose Mourinho in 2010.

""Tutti a Istanbul"", the joyous Inter fans sang with the Nerazzurri now one game away from a fourth Champions League title.

Inter coach Simone Inzaghi said: ""It's a dream come true. We always believed we could do it, we have had an extraordinary journey (to the final).

""What pleased me? Everything. The running, the determination, the concentration... they were very good.""

Facing Inzaghi's men will be either Manchester City or record 14-time winners Real Madrid, with that semi-final finely poised at 1-1 ahead of Wednesday's decider at City's Etihad Stadium.

""We're going to have to give it our all,"" Martinez said.

Milan's coach Stefano Pioli was left to contemplate a harsh ending to ""a terrific"" run to the last four.

""It's normal to be disappointed after losing in the semi-final, especially in a derby.

""The players gave their all in both legs but Inter deserved it. They played better than us, winning both matches.

""Given our journey and what we've done over the past three years it would have been fabulous to get to the final. But we didn't make it, that's a massive disappointment.""",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689846/Inter-win-Milan-derby-to-reach-Champions-League-final,2023-05-18 10:39:24,daily-sun
1110,"Stoinis, Mohsin help Lucknow edge Mumbai to boost play-off hopes","Marcus Stoinis' unbeaten 89 and last over heroics by Mohsin Khan helped Lucknow Super Giants bolster their play-off hopes with a five-run win over Mumbai Indians in IPL on Tuesday.

Mohsin, an up and coming left-arm quick who returned figures of 1-26, defended 11 off the final over as Mumbai fell short of their 178-run victory target in Lucknow.

Impact player Yash Thakur and leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi took two wickets each to add to Lucknow's bowling attack.

Lucknow swapped places with five-time winners Mumbai to jump to third in their bid for a top-four finish in the group stage for a play-off berth.

""We just lost the game. We didn't play well enough to win,"" said Mumbai skipper Rohit Sharma. ""There were moments we didn't win. Unfortunate but we need to keep our heads high.""

Holders Gujarat Titans have already booked their spot and assured a top-two finish. Seven off the 10 teams are fighting for the three remaining play-off places.

Stoinis set up victory for Lucknow after he put on key partnerships including an 89-run stand with skipper Krunal Pandya, who retired hurt on 49, to guide Lucknow to 177-3.

Pandya was cramping in his knock and retired one short of fifty but Stoinis soon changed gears as he raised his fifty with a six and lay into Chris Jordan in a 24-run 18th over.

He put on an unbeaten 60-run stand off 24 balls with Nicholas Pooran, who made eight, and finished the innings with a six.

""We have shown that we are a real team, there no super stars, there are different people performing for us,"" said man of the match Stoinis.

In reply, Ishan Kishan smashed 59 and put on a 90-run opening stand with Rohit, who made 37.

Bishnoi sent the two back in the pavilion and Thakur got the big wicket of Suryakumar Yadav, for seven. Mumbai soon slipped to 145-5 in 17.4 overs.

1113,Ex-Audi boss Stadler pleads guilty in German 'dieselgate' trial,"Ex-Audi CEO Rupert Stadler pleaded guilty at his ""dieselgate"" fraud trial Tuesday, admitting that he allowed vehicles equipped with emissions cheating software to remain on sale even after learning of the scam.

The admission at the Munich district court comes as part of a plea deal that will see Stadler, who has been on trial since 2020, escape jail time.

""In the course of addressing the diesel issue"" after the scandal became public, Stadler ""neglected"" to inform business partners that cars with so-called defeat devices were still going on the market, his lawyer Ulrike Thole-Groll told the court in a statement.

In doing so, Stadler was ""accepting that vehicles equipped with the illegal software would go on sale,"" she said.

Asked by the judge whether the statement was correct, Stadler replied: ""Yes.""

German car giant VW -- whose subsidiaries include not just Audi but also Porsche, Skoda and Seat -- admitted in September 2015 that it had installed software to rig emission levels in 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide.

The ""defeat devices"" made the vehicles appear less polluting in lab tests than they were on the road.

But his defence team announced earlier this month that Stadler had accepted a plea deal that included a confession in exchange for a suspended sentence of up to two years.

Stalder also agreed to make a payment of 1.1 million euros ($1.2 million).

A verdict is expected in June.

Last month Wolfgang Hatz, another former Audi executive who was on trial alongside Stadler, also pleaded guilty, confessing that he and two other colleagues had arranged the installation of emissions-cheating software.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689696/ExAudi-boss-Stadler-pleads-guilty-in-German-dieselgate-trial,2023-05-18 10:39:25,daily-sun
1114,"Vodafone's new CEO axes 11,000 jobs in fresh tech cull","British mobile phone giant Vodafone on Tuesday said it planned to axe 11,000 jobs over the next three years as new chief executive Margherita Della Valle seeks a ""simpler"" organisation.

""Our performance has not been good enough,"" Della Valle said alongside news of flat annual revenue at the group.

""To consistently deliver, Vodafone must change,"" Della Valle added in a statement.

""We will simplify our organisation, cutting out complexity to regain our competitiveness,"" added Della Valle, appointed CEO on a permanent basis at the start of May after five months as interim boss.

Vodafone's announcement follows the axing this year of tens of thousands of jobs across the global tech sector, including by Facebook parent Meta, as soaring inflation weakened the economy.

Della Valle's predecessor Nick Read stepped down in early December after a four-year tenure marked by a steep fall in the company's share price.

He left with Vodafone in talks over merging its UK operations with rival Three UK, owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison.

Vodafone on Tuesday added that group revenue stood at 45.7 billion euros in its financial year to the end of March, almost flat compared with 2021/22.

It added that net profit surged to 11.8 billion euros from 2.2 billion, reflecting its part-disposal of European mast division, Vantage Towers.

""We will be a leaner and simpler organisation, to increase our commercial agility and free up resources,"" the company said Tuesday.

It announced ""11,000 role reductions planned over three years, with both HQ and local markets simplification"".

Vodafone, which has more than 300 million mobile customers in Europe and Africa, is heavily focused on accelerating rollout of 5G in the UK.

It is banking on the merger of its UK operations with Three to expand broadband connectivity to rural communities and small businesses.

The rollout of faster 5G connectivity has been hampered by Britain's ban on the Chinese giant Huawei from involvement in the technology.

Following Tuesday's announcements, shares in Vodafone dropped 2.9 percent to 87.42 pence at the start of trading on London's benchmark FTSE 100 index, which was slightly higher overall.

At the end of 2022, Vodafone unveiled a blockbuster deal with investment firms GIP and KKR to form a joint venture that would maintain its majority stake in Vantage Towers.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689691/Vodafones-new-CEO-axes-11000-jobs-in-fresh-tech-cull,2023-05-18 10:39:26,daily-sun

1116,PM’s Tri-nation Visit Pushes Bangladesh to New Heights,"Farida Yasmin

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina began her tri-nation tour on April 25 and returned home on May 9. She first visited Tokyo at the invitation of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and went to the United States at the invitation of the World Bank. She participated in the 50th anniversary of the relationship between Bangladesh and the World Bank. She travelled to London from the USA to attend King Charles III's coronation. She held bilateral and sideline meetings, alongside interaction with top businessmen from various countries. She called for investment in Bangladesh.

On April 25, at 7:56 am, I left Dhaka for Tokyo by a special flight of Bangladesh Biman as an entourage of the prime minister. The plane landed at Tokyo's Haneda International Airport at 1:48 PM Bangladesh time and 4:48 PM local time. On arrival at Haneda International Airport, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was welcomed by Japanese State Minister for Foreign Affairs TAKEI Shunsuke and Bangladesh Ambassador to Japan Shahabuddin Ahmed and was given a formal red carpet reception and guard of honour.

The prime minister along with her personal staff, three full ministers and an adviser went to the Akasaka Palace, the state guesthouse. The entourages went to a five-star hotel, New Otani. When Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman visited Japan in 1973, he stayed at this hotel. He was accompanied by his younger daughter Sheikh Rehana and youngest son Sheikh Russell.

During the recent visit, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was in Japan for four days. A bilateral meeting was held between the two premiers. Eight MoUs were signed in the presence of the duo. Agreements and MoUs were signed on military cooperation, ship recycling, customs, information technology and cyber security, industrial development, agriculture, intellectual property and metro rail.

The two prime ministers discussed Moheshkhali-Matarbari Integrated Infrastructure Development Initiative (MIDI) and the Bay of Bengal Industrial Growth Belt economic partnership. Matarbari deep seaport in Moheshkhali is being constructed with funding from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Japan is building this port at a cost of Tk 17,000 crores. Already, the largest ship in the history of the country has arrived at this port. Apart from Bangladesh, this deep seaport will provide cargo transportation facilities to north-eastern region of India. The two superpowers, India and China, were interested in the construction of this port.

Cooperation between Japan and Bangladesh at the public and private levels is going to be strengthened in the ongoing efforts to become a developed Bangladesh by 2041. Sheikh Hasina has solicited the cooperation of the Japanese Prime Minister in the repatriation of the Rohingyas. Dhaka-Narita direct flight is going to start this year.

The two leaders discussed trade expansion and regional peace and security. Dhaka will purchase military weapons and equipment from Tokyo in military cooperation. Defence cooperation is supposed to increase the stockpile of armaments and enhance combat strategic capabilities. Besides, they agreed on defence visits, dialogues, seminars, training and workshops.

Bangladesh is a country bordering India. Bangladesh can serve as a gateway to Southeast Asia and South Asia. Considering these, Bangladesh is in a strategically important position. Japan is giving importance to Bangladesh as it can make an important contribution to the stability of the Indo-Pacific region.

As a result, Japan is cooperating with Bangladesh on developing communication infrastructure and increasing industrial production. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to Japan has intensified relations between the two countries. After a joint meeting, the two prime ministers held a joint press conference.

The Prime Minister of Japan praised the economic development of Bangladesh and said that the establishment of an economic zone and improvement of the investment environment will make the relationship between the two countries more dynamic. Earlier, during his visit to India in March, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced new plans for the region in his speech in New Delhi. There, he called for cooperation with Bangladesh including a partnership agreement. A visit to Japan is crucial at the time of the Russia-Ukraine war, post-Covid-19 and global economic recession, especially during new polarisation triggered by the Russia-Ukraine warfare. China and Russia are considered by Japan as a threat to the security of the Indo-Pacific and Europe. There, Japan is becoming interested in creating strategic relations with Bangladesh.

In a joint statement, the prime ministers of the two countries expressed confidence in the establishment of military relations between the two countries. An increase in the stockpile of weapons and war strategic capabilities have also been discussed. So, the seed of economic and military cooperation between Bangladesh and Japan has been sowed.

The relationship between Bangladesh and Japan has reached from a comprehensive partnership to a strategic partnership. Japan was one of the few countries to have recognised Bangladesh as an independent country on February 10, 1972. Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman intensified the fraternal relationship between the two countries through his visit to Japan the following year.

On the four-day visit, Sheikh Hasina paid a courtesy call on Emperor Naruhito at the Imperial Palace. Meetings were held with Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, JICA President, and JETRO Chairman. Besides, she handed over crests to some Japanese nationals who contributed to the Liberation War in 1971.

The Japanese government has viewed the visit of Bangabandhu's daughter with great importance. The streets of Tokyo are adorned with the flags of Bangladesh and Japan. Red carpet reception and guard of honour are given at the airport.

After the visit, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina went to the United States. Earlier, the World Bank refused to provide loan assistance to Bangladesh for the construction of the Padma Bridge on the pretext of conspiracy of corruption. The presence of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the World Bank after the construction of the Padma Bridge with our own financing has added a new dimension.

The prime minister presented a photograph of Padma Bridge to World Bank Chief David R. Malpass on the occasion. Sheikh Hasina firmly said in her speech, “We have not come to beg, we have come to take loans.” A loan agreement of $2.25 billion was signed between Bangladesh and the World Bank. This money will be spent on five projects of regional trade and communication, disaster preparedness and environmental management. Among these projects, Delta Plan 2100 is the first major investment project. In the United States, Sheikh Hasina called for investment in Bangladesh in a meeting with businessmen. She proposed to establish a special economic zone for US businessmen.

Later, on May 4, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina travelled to London in a bid to attend the inauguration of King Charles III. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak praised Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, saying his wife and two daughters are fans of her. He also termed her an inspiration for South Asian leaders. Rishi Sunak acclaimed the high economic growth of Bangladesh. He shared his appreciation with Sheikh Hasina during bilateral talks at the reception of Heads of Commonwealth States and Governments on the eve of King Charles III's coronation. The two leaders discussed in a very cordial atmosphere.

Before Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's three-nation state visit, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs clarified Bangladesh's standpoint on the Indo-Pacific strategy. State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shahriar Alam clarified Bangladesh's stance in the Indo-Pacific framework and called for mutual trust and cooperation in promoting trade and security with countries from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific.

In addition to the United States, many countries in the Indo-Pacific region including Japan, China, Australia, India and Bangladesh attended the programme. The US-led strategy of the Indo-Pacific region included all three countries visited by Sheikh Hasina. As a result, the tour of these three countries is very important at the moment.

The British government transferred Bangladesh from the South Asia desk to the Indo-Pacific region. King Charles III spoke with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the Heads of Commonwealth States reception, giving Bangladesh great importance. Princess Anne, daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, spoke enthusiastically to the Prime Minister and inquired about her Ashrayan Project (the project taken to build homes for homeless and displaced people). British Foreign Minister James Cleverley MP along with his wife met Sheikh Hasina at her hotel. It was not a pre-arranged meeting. This meeting with the British Foreign Minister is very important. Besides, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair met Sheikh Hasina. Heads of seven states including Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Bhutan came to the hotel suite and held sideline meetings with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. They appreciated the progress of Bangladesh. All of them praised the humanity of Sheikh Hasina for rehabilitating the Rohingya displaced people. Sheikh Hasina drew their attention to the repatriation of Rohingyas.

Bangladesh has transformed from a bottomless basket to a superhighway of development today. Self-financed construction of the Padma Bridge, Karnaphuli Tunnel, Metrorail, Rooppur Nuclear Project, construction of a deep seaport, Covid-19 management, etc drew the attention of the world.

The country has set a journey towards Smart Bangladesh. The nation is now ready to face the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution. All these things are catalysts for changes in Bangladesh. World leaders praised Sheikh Hasina's courage, determination and leadership. Bangladesh is placed in a dignified position because of Sheikh Hasina's visionary leadership. The tri-nation visit is an example of the successful and visionary diplomacy of Bangladesh. All these will add new dimensions to the ongoing process of becoming a developed country by 2041.

1117,"G-7 Hiroshima summit: Who’s attending, what will be discussed?","Leaders of seven of the world’s most powerful democracies will gather this weekend for the Group of Seven summit in Hiroshima, the location of the world’s first atomic attack at the end of World War II.

From the emergence of crucial developing countries to security worries, including growing aggression from China, North Korea and Russia, here’s a look at the G-7, who will attend and some of the key issues:

The Group of Seven is an informal group of leading industrialized nations. It consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

This year is Japan’s turn to host, but the presidency of G-7 summits revolves among the seven members. Two representatives of the European Union also join.

As is customary in recent years, leaders from some non-G-7 countries and international organizations will also participate in some sessions.

The leaders discuss a wide range of issues, including economic policy, security, climate change, energy and gender.

The first summit was in 1975, when France hosted what was then a Group of Six meeting to discuss tackling a recession that followed an Arab oil embargo. Canada became the seventh member a year later. Russia joined to form the G-8 in 1998 but was expelled after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.

This year, the leaders of Australia, Brazil, Comoros, Cook Islands, India, Indonesia, South Korea and Vietnam are invited, as Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida stresses the importance of reaching out to developing countries in the so-called Global South and U.S. allies and partners.

The invitations to leaders outside the G-7 are meant to extend cooperation to a broader range of countries.

The G-7 countries’ share of global economic activity has shrunk to about 30% from roughly 50% four decades ago. Developing economies such as China, India and Brazil have made huge gains, raising questions about the G-7′s relevance and its role in leading a world economy that’s increasingly reliant on growth in less wealthy nations.

Leaders of the United Nations, the International Energy Agency, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Bank, the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization are also invited.

WHY HIROSHIMA?

Hiroshima is Kishida’s hometown. His choice of venue underscores a determination to put nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation at the top of the agenda of this year’s summit.

A path to nuclear disarmament has appeared more difficult with Russia’s recent nuclear weapon threats in Ukraine, as well as nuclear and missile development by China and North Korea.

Japan, which is protected by the U.S. nuclear umbrella, has also faced criticism that its nuclear disarmament pledge is an empty promise. Kishida is trying to forge a realistic roadmap between the current harsh reality and the ideal of a world without nuclear weapons.

Kishida on Friday will welcome arriving leaders at the Hiroshima Peace Park. He also plans to escort the leaders to the A-bomb museum, in the first group visit by heads of nuclear states. There might also be a meeting with atomic bomb survivors.

“I believe the first step toward any nuclear disarmament effort is to provide a first-hand experience of the consequences of the atomic bombing and to firmly convey the reality,” Kishida said Saturday during a visit to Hiroshima to observe summit preparations.

WHAT ARE THE TOP ISSUES?

G-7 leaders are expected to strongly condemn Russia’s war on Ukraine while pledging their continuing support for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will join the session via the internet.

There will also be a focus on Beijing’s escalating threats against Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island Beijing claims as its own, and ways to reduce Western democracies’ economic and supply chain dependency on China.

To address the rise of Global South nations, including many former colonies of Western powers with varied views on and ties to Russia and China, the G-7 will offer these countries more support in health, food security and infrastructure to develop closer ties.

WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?

In a closely watched event on the sidelines of the summit, Kishida will meet together with President Joe Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to discuss closer security cooperation, possibly including stronger nuclear deterrence.

Kishida and Yoon will pay their respects together at a Hiroshima memorial for Korean atomic bomb victims in a trust-building gesture as the two countries repair ties strained by disputes stemming from Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/690022/G7-Hiroshima-summit:-Who’s-attending-what-will-be-discussed,2023-05-18 10:39:27,daily-sun
1118,Asia is spending big to battle low birth rates - will it work?,"Falling birth rates are a major concern for some of Asia's biggest economies.

Governments in the region are spending hundreds of billions of dollars trying to reverse the trend. Will it work?

China, which has seen its population fall for the first time on 60 years, recently joined the growing club.

While it is difficult to quantify exactly how much these policies have cost, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol recently said his country had spent more than $200bn (£160bn) over the past 16 years on trying to boost the population.

Yet last year South Korea broke its own record for the world's lowest fertility rate, with the average number of babies expected per woman falling to 0.78.

In neighbouring Japan, which had record low births of fewer than 800,000 last year, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has pledged to double the budget for child-related policies from 10tn yen ($74.7bn; £59.2bn), which is just over 2% of the country's gross domestic product.

Globally, while there are more countries that are trying to lower birth rates, the number of countries wanting to increase fertility has more than tripled since 1976, according to the most recent report by the United Nations.

Simply put, having a bigger population who can work and produce more goods and services leads to higher economic growth. And while a larger population can mean higher costs for governments, it can also result in bigger tax revenues.

Also, many Asian countries are ageing rapidly. Japan leads the pack with nearly 30% of its population now over the age of 65 and some other nations in the region are not far behind.

Compare that with India, which has just overtaken China as the world's most populous nation. More than a quarter of its people are between the age of 10 and 20, which gives its economy huge potential for growth.

And when the share of the working age population gets smaller, the cost and burden of looking after the non-working population grow.

""Negative population growth has an impact on the economy, and combined that with an ageing population, they won't be able to afford to support the elderly,"" said Xiujian Peng of Victoria University.

Most of the measures across the region to increase birth rates have been similar: payments for new parents, subsidised or free education, extra nurseries, tax incentives and expanded parental leave.

But do these measures work?

Data for last few decades from Japan, South Korea and Singapore shows that attempts to boost their populations have had very little impact. Japan's finance ministry has published a study which said the policies were a failure.

It is a view echoed by the United Nations.

""We know from history that the types of policies which we call demographic engineering where they try to incentivise women to have more babies, they just don't work,"" Alanna Armitage of United Nations Population Fund told the BBC.

""We need to understand the underlying determinants of why women are not having children, and that is often the inability of women to be able to combine their work life with their family life,"" she added.

But in Scandinavian countries, fertility policies have worked better than they did in Asia, according to Ms Peng.

""The main reason is because they have a good welfare system and the cost of raising children is cheaper. Their gender equality is also much more balanced than in Asian countries.""

Asian countries have ranked lower in comparison in the global gender gap report by the World Economic Forum.

There are also major questions over how these expensive measures should be funded, especially in Japan, which is the world's most indebted developed economy.

Options under consideration in Japan include selling more government bonds, which means increasing its debt, raising its sales tax or increasing social insurance premiums.

The first option adds financial burden to the future generations, while the other two would hit already struggling workers, which could convince them to have fewer children.

But Antonio Fatás, professor of economics at INSEAD says regardless of whether these policies work, they have to invest in them.

""Fertility rates have not increased but what if there was less support? Maybe they would be even lower,"" he said.

Governments are also investing in other areas to prepare their economies for shrinking populations.

""China has been investing in technologies and innovations to make up for the declining labour force in order to mitigate the negative impact of the shrinking population,"" said Ms Peng.

Also, while it remains unpopular in countries like Japan and South Korea, lawmakers are discussing changing their immigration rules to try to entice younger workers from overseas.

""Globally, the fertility rate is falling so it'll be a race to attract young people to come and work in your country,"" Ms Peng added.

Whether the money is well spent on fertility policies, these governments appear to have no other choice.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689851/Asia-is-spending-big-to-battle-low-birth-rates--will-it-work,2023-05-18 10:39:27,daily-sun
1119,Why Pakistan shut down the internet,"The battle between Imran Khan's supporters and the powerful Pakistani military has this week been raging on two fronts - on the streets and on social media. And on one battlefield, the former prime minister seems to have the upper hand.

Within hours of Imran Khan's arrest on Tuesday, Pakistan's government had clamped down on the country's internet, in a move to quell resistance.

In Lahore, Nighat Dad rushed home after hearing Khan had been detained. Leaving the office in the city centre, the lawyer's staff had already started to encounter violent protesters.

""A mob tried to attack their cars and stop them from leaving,"" she told the BBC.

As one of Pakistan's leading digital rights activists, she was also keeping an eye on the discourse raging online.

Images of stone-throwing protesters in clouds of teargas unrolled across social media and pinged across WhatsApp groups. Video of the arrest - Khan being swarmed by paramilitary troops - went viral. His party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), spat out rapid-fire updates on their Twitter page.

To control the rapidly escalating situation, the government flipped the switch. Across the country, social media sites went down - people struggled to load Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.

When the blackout came, for most Pakistanis it wasn't unexpected. Those that could, booted up their VPNs - demand for the services which reroute a user's internet location skyrocketed by 1,300%, trackers later told the BBC. Those with mobile access continued on WhatsApp.

'Real news' online

Shutting down the internet has become a familiar move in the authoritarian playbook, particularly in South Asia in recent years. Authorities plunge the country offline to control the flow of information, and suppress any dissent or protest, experts say.

""Governments have a hammer, and it's easy to treat the internet as a nail,"" says Kathik Nachiappan, a South Asia expert based in Singapore.

In Pakistan, the move has particular impact because it shuts down what is seen to be the only place to get ""real news"" in the country - a decade of attacks on the country's independent journalists and newspapers by the military authorities is widely regarded to have muzzled the mainstream media.

Trust that mainstream outlets will adequately inform the public has broken down so much that people go online to find out ""what is truly going on"", says Uzair Younus, a Pakistani politics expert with The Atlantic Council, a US-based think tank.

""People say 'OK, it's not worth really watching television, because the military is governing what can and cannot be said,'"" says Mr Younus.

So when it comes to breaking news like Khan's arrest, people flock online, to reputable journalists and YouTube channels as well as social media.

""I was glued to my screen at work, watching Geo News, one of the country's largest broadcasters,"" says Mr Younus. ""But then I was getting a whole lot more information about protests - who had been shot, where tear gas was being shared - on WhatsApp and on Twitter. Geo was not covering any of that.""

Of course, there are all the usual issues that come with relying on social media news - in Pakistan's bitterly complicated political scene, misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories are all rampant, and often peddled by the political actors themselves.

No matter what kind of information people are consuming, limiting online access is a gross violation of fundamental rights, says Ms Dad, who runs the Digital Rights Foundation in Lahore.

""When you shut down the Internet, people have no choice in accessing information,"" she says.

She argues the authorities' blanket ban violates freedom of speech, access to information and the right to assembly - which are all enshrined in Pakistan's constitution. Internet access is a human right recognised by the United Nations.

Most severe censorship yet

But for Pakistanis, internet censorship days have become increasingly common since Mr Khan was voted out by parliament last April.

The charismatic politician has been on the comeback trail ever since, charging around the country on a convoy, loudly claiming his removal was illegitimate and the charges against him are false. He has spurred thousands to attend his rallies.

Netblocks, a UK-based internet monitor, has counted at least three major internet disruptions linked to Khan's rallies before his arrest - but this week's was the worst yet.

""This is possibly the most severe censorship that we've tracked for Pakistan in recent times,"" Netblocks researcher Alp Toker told the BBC.

""The scale of it and the fact it involves multiple forms of disruption - both the mobile networks and the social platforms - show a concerted effort to control the narrative.""

Netblocks identified that the mobile networks affected had gone down in areas in Punjab - a Khan stronghold and Pakistan's most populous province. The telecoms authority later confirmed it had sent around the kill order following a directive from the interior ministry.

For Pakistan's current rulers, shutting down the internet is a significant move and one not taken lightly. It cuts off public access to healthcare, emergency and financial services.

It has been a big hit to an already failing economy, affecting businesses across the country. Tens of millions of Pakistanis - from delivery drivers to the tech community - rely on the Internet to earn a living.

On Wednesday, hundreds of Pakistani business leaders and civil rights figures signed a letter condemning the internet shutdown, expressing fears that it would negatively affect the country's vibrant tech sector - one of the only areas bringing in much-needed foreign investment.

But political watchers say it's clear that authorities are willing to sacrifice all that to cut off one of Mr Khan's greatest advantages- his dominance online.

Khan's online dominance

His party, the PTI, has the major edge over political competitors with a younger, tech-savvy voter base. Its social media machine - credited with delivering the 2018 election - is miles ahead of the competition.

The military and the government are worried about the party using social media for ""anti-army political mobilisation"" says Asfandyar Mir, a Pakistan politics and military watcher with the United States Institute of Peace. It's something that Khan himself is personally invested in, he says.

""The military in particular sees the scale of retweets and likes on twitter as a signal of political strength which can have knock on mobilisation effects,"" he said.

Since Khan's arrest, the PTI has been feeding a legion of about nine million followers on Twitter with hourly updates. Khan himself has over 19 million followers on Twitter - the military has about six million and the current PM, Shehbaz Sharif, 6.6 million followers.

What's even more galling for the military now, is that they had previously hitched their social media presence to Khan's bandwagon.

When Khan rose to power in 2018, then with the support of the military, the generals had outsourced the task of building their not insignificant social presence to the PTI as a joint effort. But when Khan and the army fell out, the PTI managed to wrest away most of their online following.

The military has since found itself on the back foot online, struggling to control the narrative, says Mr Younus. It fended off campaigns from the PTI coordinating followers through hashtags and site attacks.

Under attack on their YouTube account this week, the military at first disabled rabid comments from Khan's supporters. In the end, they just turned the whole thing off.

""Because they don't have the capability the PTI does on social media, the obvious answer was to turn it all off because that's the only way they can control things,"" says Mr Younus.

But blocking social media is only one layer of disruption. Much more crucial to organising efforts for protesters is WhatsApp - the messaging app seen as the backbone for information flow in the country.

Both political sides are pushing out their message on the app, but the PTI again has a slight upper hand.

""They've done a fantastic job of creating these communities and groups through which they proliferate information or their own narrative,"" Mr Younus says.

On Friday, as the situation remained tense across the country, most citizens still had little access to the internet.

The army had been deployed in the capital and the twists and turns in Khan's legal case threatened to kick protests off again.

Some people had regained access to Facebook and YouTube, but the restrictions were patchy and arbitrarily applied across the country.

The political fervour, however, remains at an all-time high and the discussion is still raging online.

""People are charged and emotions are high, not only because of what's happened to Imran Khan but also because of the economic downfall in the country,"" says Ms Dad.

""It's a mix of anger and frustration that has come to a boiling point. Everyone has something to say.""",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689480/Why-Pakistan-shut-down-the-internet,2023-05-18 10:39:28,daily-sun
1120,Turkey decides on future with or without Erdogan,"Turks are voting in the most pivotal elections in their modern history, to decide if Recep Tayyip Erdogan remains president after 20 years in power.

His main rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, promises to scrap many of the powers acquired by President Erdogan after he survived a failed coup in 2016.

But this race has become so intense and the stakes so high that campaigning went up to the wire

President Erdogan was filmed stretching election rules by addressing worshippers at Saturday evening prayers in Istanbul.

To secure outright victory on Sunday, the winner needs more than 50% of the vote. Otherwise it goes to a run-off in two weeks' time.

Turkey's 64 million voters go to the polls in particularly hard times.

Rampant inflation is officially almost 44%, but many Turks believe it is far higher, while 11 of the country's provinces have been affected by twin earthquakes that left more than 50,000 people dead.

Inflation soared as President Erdogan abandoned orthodox economics, cutting interest rates while most other countries raised theirs.

A few doors down the street, shopkeeper Rahime revealed layers of price labels that she stuck on top of each other almost daily because of soaring costs.

""People come in and ask why are prices rising all the time, and they leave without buying anything,"" she said.

Rahime's 19-year-old daughter Sudenur feels anxious about the future, and is worried she may not be able to fulfil her ambition of studying sport science.

As a first-time voter, she and five million others like her are expected to make a big difference to the election result.

Turks have from 08:00 to 17:00 (05:00-14:00 GMT) to vote, although 1.76 million have already cast their ballots abroad in Germany, France and other countries - a record 53% turnout.

For survivors affected by the 6 February earthquakes, voting will prove far harder, because many have left their homes and can only vote where they are registered.

The aftermath of the disaster has overshadowed the election campaign and become second only to the economy as a key issue.

In Adana, where hundreds of people died in collapsed buildings, there is still palpable anger about the response.

""I think the earthquake will affect the outcome of the elections seriously, because people feel resentful to the government, if not the state,"" said Ezgi Karaher as she walked with her young daughter in the park.

Political parties have laid on buses for thousands of survivors from across Turkey to travel back to vote in some of the worst-hit provinces where they are still registered.

On the sunny platform at Iskenderun station, people were arriving by train too.

""It was standing-room only this morning,"" said one arrival on an early morning service.

Staff said some 300 extra passengers were aboard, heading to stay with family or friends for the night. They were braced for even more voters to come on the late train.

Not everyone is able to go back. Two women at an Ankara supermarket told the BBC they would miss out on voting because they were having medical treatment following the earthquake.

Party strongholds across the country are ablaze with their respective party colours and slogans.

And tensions have increased in the run-up to polling day.

Opposition parties are deploying volunteers to ensure the 192,000 ballot boxes and results are properly scrutinised to avoid the risk of fraud.

One of the four presidential candidates, Muharrem Ince, pulled out of the race three days ago, citing a smear campaign of ""character assassination"". But it was too late to remove his name from the ballot.

In the final hours of the campaign on Saturday, Mr Kilicdaroglu, 74, laid carnations at the mausoleum of Turkey's modern-day secular founder Ataturk.

And President Erdogan, who is 69, ended his election push by leading evening prayers at Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul, but then he went further. Video shared on social media showed him telling worshippers the Muslim world was closely following events in Turkey.

His choice of venue and his decision to give a political speech after campaigning had officially ended was controversial, and highly symbolic to his supporters.

Hagia Sophia, originally built as an Orthodox Christian cathedral, was a mosque under the Ottomans. But Ataturk turned it into a museum and it was President Erdogan who defied secular Turkey's founder and made it a mosque once more in 2020.

Ultra-nationalist Sinan Ogan is the only other presidential candidate.

But Turks are also voting for parliament and its 600 MPs. Although they have lost powers to Mr Erdogan's executive presidency since 2018, control of parliament remains key for passing legislation.

Under Turkey's proportional voting system, parties form alliances so they can reach the 7% threshold required to enter parliament.

The president's AK Party, which has Islamist roots, is part of the People's Alliance with the nationalist MHP and two other parties, while Mr Kilicdaroglu's centre-left Republican People's Party is working with the nationalist Good Party and four smaller parties under the Nation Alliance.

The pro-Kurdish HDP, Turkey's second biggest opposition party, is part of another alliance, but has campaigned under a different name, the Green Left.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689305/Turkey-decides-on-future-with-or-without-Erdogan,2023-05-18 10:39:28,daily-sun

1122,Thailand election: The party they can't stop winning,"For the past few weeks an irresistibly catchy tune has been playing in neighbourhoods across Thailand, from campaign trucks sent out by the Pheu Thai party, the frontrunner in this Sunday's general election.

""A landslide for Pheu Thai, in all areas, so the lives of the people can be better,"" it goes, urging voters to give it a thumping victory.

Mr Thaksin's government was deposed by a military coup in 2006, and Thai Rak Thai was dissolved. He has been living in exile since being prosecuted in what his family says are politically-motivated charges. A successor party was also dissolved by the courts in 2008, and in that year two of its prime ministers were disqualified.

After Mr Thaksin's sister Yingluck won a landslide in the 2011 election, she too was disqualified by the courts, and her government ousted by a second coup. She is also living in exile.

At the last election in 2019 Pheu Thai won far more seats than any other party, but was prevented from forming a government.

Now the polls show Pheu Thai on track once again for victory. The Shinawatra family has put forward Thaksin's youngest daughter Paetongtarn to lead the campaign, which she has done even in the last stages of pregnancy, eliciting admiration and sympathy.

It has once again run a slick, well-marketed campaign, making a range of appealing offers to the electorate, from a substantial increase in the minimum wage, to a promise of a 10,000 baht ($300; £240) digital wallet for every adult to be spent locally.

""For many years no other political force has been able to offer an alternative to Pheu Thai, in terms of policy offerings, in terms of charisma, in being able to communicate directly with the people"", says Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University, who has been making a study of the party's appeal.

""And because the last coup d'etat resulted in two military-backed governments which failed miserably in economic performance and in dealing with the Covid pandemic, the popularity of its main opponent Pheu Thai remains high.""

Ms Siripan identifies what she calls the three Ps as the key to political success in Thailand; policies, personalities and patronage networks, and political values.

Pheu Thai has always been very strong on the first. Thai Rak Thai was a pioneer in this region in running a modern, manifesto-based campaign in its first election campaign in 2001. It offered policies like universal healthcare and village-based micro-credit schemes which directly benefitted rural and low-income communities. It won the Shinawatra family what has proved to be unbreakable loyalty from some of Thailand's largest vote banks.

On the second, Pheu Thai has built up an extensive network of local power-brokers, who are very influential in maintaining its popularity and getting the vote out. By contrast the two main conservative parties, formed by the last coup-leader Prayuth Chan-ocha and his allies, are relatively new, and do not have such strong local networks.

On the third, Pheu Thai has always successfully portrayed itself both as the party which looks after little people, and which champions democracy, of governments through elections. And that is its main pitch today. If you want an end to conservative, military-backed rule, it says, we are your best choice.

But this time it is being outflanked on political values by a more radical and youthful party, Move Forward, which is calling for profound changes to Thailand's power structures.

It wants to stop the military from intervening in politics, to limit its budget, end conscription, and even talks about making the monarchy more accountable. It has pledged never to form a coalition with one of the military-aligned parties, showing up Pheu Thai's evasiveness on this issue.

Some observers believe Move Forward's growing popularity could eat into Pheu Thai's votes, although the younger party's support is spread across the country, rather than in certain areas, disadvantaging it in a system where 80% of the seats are elected on a first-past-the-post basis.

Pheu Thai is losing its policy edge too, as nearly every main party is now making a crowd-pleasing financial offering to the voters, neutralising the populist appeal that has been the key to Pheu Thai's long run of election wins.

""Especially for the younger generation, Thaksin's legacy of policy delivery in the past does not resonate,"" says Siripan from Chulalaongkorn. ""And don't forget there will be four million first-time voters in this election. Pheu Thai's image as the default anti-military party is facing a real challenge from Move Forward.

""But I still believe Pheu Thai will win by a large margin. It still has the second P, the patronage networks through its candidates in the north and north-east, where Move Forward, as the newer party, has not established these kinds of connections.""

If the predictions of the opinion polls hold, and both Pheu Thai and Move Forward perform well enough to ensure they have a substantial majority of the 500 seats in the lower house, the big question is whether they will be allowed to form a government.

The military-drafted constitution allows 250 senators, all appointed by the junta that seized power in 2014, to join the vote on the choice of the next prime minister. The pliant courts could once again be deployed to dissolve one or both of the reformist parties.

Thailand will then be confronted with a choice. Should it stick to the old, authoritarian playbook, which sees election results as optional, rather than essential factors in who holds power?

Or should it break out of the cycle of coups, party dissolutions and street violence which have plagued the country for two decades?",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/688974/Thailand-election:-The-party-they-cant-stop-winning,2023-05-18 10:39:29,daily-sun

1124,"Don't use non-sugar sweeteners for weight control, WHO says in newly released guidelines","The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a new guideline on non-sugar sweeteners (NSS), which recommends against the use of NSS to control body weight or reduce the risk of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).

The recommendation is based on the findings of a systematic review of the available evidence, which suggests that the use of NSS does not confer any long-term benefit in reducing body fat in adults or children.

""Replacing free sugars with NSS does not help with weight control in the long term. People need to consider other ways to reduce free sugars intake, such as consuming food with naturally occurring sugars, like fruit, or unsweetened food and beverages,” said Francesco Branca, WHO Director for Nutrition and Food Safety on Monday.

""NSS are not essential dietary factors and have no nutritional value. People should reduce the sweetness of the diet altogether, starting early in life, to improve their health.""

The recommendation applies to all people except individuals with pre-existing diabetes and includes all synthetic and naturally occurring or modified non-nutritive sweeteners that are not classified as sugars found in manufactured foods and beverages, or sold on their own to be added to foods and beverages by consumers.

Common NSS include acesulfame K, aspartame, advantame, cyclamates, neotame, saccharin, sucralose, stevia and stevia derivatives.

The recommendation does not apply to personal care and hygiene products containing NSS, such as toothpaste, skin cream, and medications, or to low-calorie sugars and sugar alcohols (polyols), which are sugars or sugar derivatives containing calories and are therefore not considered NSS.

This signals that policy decisions based on this recommendation may require substantive discussion in specific country contexts, linked for example to the extent of consumption in different age groups.

The WHO guideline on NSS is part of a suite of existing and forthcoming guidelines on healthy diets that aim to establish lifelong healthy eating habits, improve dietary quality and decrease the risk of NCDs worldwide.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689540/Dont-use-nonsugar-sweeteners-for-weight-control-WHO-says-in-newly-released-guidelines,2023-05-18 10:39:30,daily-sun
1125,US panel recommends nonprescription use of contraception pill,"A US panel of health experts voted Wednesday in favor of making birth control pills available without a prescription, a move backed by reproductive rights advocates especially in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling overturning the national right to abortion.

The independent panel voted unanimously that the benefits of allowing the medicine, Opill, to be sold over the counter, outweighed the risks and would reduce hurdles associated with visiting a doctor that impact lower income groups disproportionately.

""We now have been presented with ample data demonstrating the effective safe use and benefits for people who want to have access to reproductive autonomy.""

The committee's votes are usually accepted by the Food and Drug Administration, which means the pill, which is made by HRA Pharma, might be available without prescription in the coming weeks.

While likely, approval is not assured. FDA scientists highlighted safety concerns, such as the potential impact on people with a history or current diagnosis of breast cancer, or whether they would understand the pill needs to be taken the same time every day to prevent pregnancy.

""There is also concern that some consumers may not consistently use the product correctly on a chronic basis and be at risk for pregnancy, but not recognize that they are pregnant because of the irregular bleeding that would be ascribed to the known side effect,"" the FDA wrote in a document.

The push for a non-prescription pill has taken on new urgency in light of a Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion, leading to numerous bans and severe restrictions in conservative states.

If the pill is approved, the US would join more than 100 other countries where the pill is available without a prescription, including the UK which requires a consultation with a pharmacist.

Opill is known as a ""mini pill"" because it contains progestin only.

Another company, Cadence, is in talks with the FDA about making its combination pill, which contains both estrogen and progestin, available over the counter.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/688807/US-panel-recommends-nonprescription-use-of-contraception-pill,2023-05-18 10:39:30,daily-sun
1126,Global warming set to break key 1.5C limit for first time,"Our overheating world is likely to break a key temperature limit for the first time over the next few years, scientists predict.

Researchers say there's now a 66% chance we will pass the 1.5C global warming threshold between now and 2027.

If the world passes the limit, scientists stress the breach, while worrying, will likely be temporary.

Hitting the threshold would mean the world is 1.5C warmer than it was during the second half of the 19th Century, before fossil fuel emissions from industrialisation really began to ramp up.

The 1.5C figure has become a symbol of global climate change negotiations. Countries agreed to ""pursue efforts"" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C under the 2015 Paris agreement.

Going over 1.5C every year for a decade or two would see far greater impacts of warming, such as longer heatwaves, more intense storms and wildfires.

But passing the level in one of the next few years would not mean that the Paris limit had been broken. Scientists say there is still time to restrict global warming by cutting emissions sharply.

Back then they predicted there was less than a 20% chance of breaking 1.5C in the five years ahead.

By last year this had increased to 50%, and now it's jumped to 66%, which the scientists say means it's ""more likely than not.""

What does going over 1.5C mean?

The figure is not a direct measure of the world's temperature but an indicator of how much or how little the Earth has warmed or cooled compared to the long term global average.

Scientists use average temperature data from the period between 1850-1900 as a measure of how hot the world was before our modern reliance on coal, oil and gas.

For decades they believed that if the world warmed by around 2C that would be the threshold of dangerous impacts - but in 2018 they significantly revised this estimate, showing that going past 1.5C would be calamitous for the world.

Over the past few decades our overheating world has nudged the mercury up so that in 2016, the warmest on record, global temperatures were 1.28C above the pre-industrial figure.

Now researchers say that figure is set to be smashed - they are 98% certain the high mark will be broken before 2027.

And in the years between now and then they believe there's a very solid chance the 1.5C limit will be surpassed for the first time.

""We really are now within reach of a temporary exceedance of 1.5C for the annual mean temperature, and that's the first time in human history we've been that close,"" said Prof Adam Scaife, head of long range forecasts at the Met Office, who compile the data from weather and climate agencies around the world.

""I think that's perhaps the most stark and obvious and simplest statistic that we've got in the report,"" he told a news conference.

The researchers stress that temperatures would have to stay at or above 1.5C for 20 years to be able to say the Paris agreement threshold had been passed.

However breaking the limit even for just one year is a worrying sign that warming is accelerating and not slowing down.

""This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5C level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years,"" said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas

""However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency,"" he said.

What difference will El Niño make?

There are two key elements - the first is the continuing high levels of carbon emissions from human activities that despite a fall during the pandemic are still going up.

The second, critical part is the likely appearance of El Niño, a weather phenomenon with global implications.

For the last three years the world has been experiencing a La Niña event which has dampened climate warming to some extent.

But the extra heat that El Niño will bring to the surface of the Pacific will likely push the global temperature to a new high next year.

However there is still uncertainty around the onset and scale of the event.

""It's worth noting that a lot of our forecasts that are being made now for the El Niño that we think is developing this winter, are showing pretty big amplitude,"" Prof Scaife told reporters.

""But to actually predict the magnitude, or a subsequent event within the five-year period, we can't give the exact dates of that beyond this one year ahead, so it could be in three or four years from now we get to two and a half degree El Niño and that might be the one that does it. ""

What are the likely impacts in the UK and elsewhere?

The Arctic will experience warming at a greater level than many regions, with the temperature anomaly expected to be three times as large as the global figure over the next five northern hemisphere winters.

Northern Europe including the UK will likely experience increased rainfall for the May to September period over the next five years, the report says.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689877/Global-warming-set-to-break-key-1.5C-limit-for-first-time,2023-05-18 10:39:31,daily-sun
1127,Coming years 'critical' to slash plastic pollution: UN,"The world must halve single-use plastics and slash throwaway consumption to stem the tide of environmental pollution, according to a UN report on Tuesday that warns the next few years are critical.

Concern is growing about the impacts of microplastics -- produced when plastic products break down in the environment -- which have been found from the deepest oceans trenches to top of Mount Everest.

The report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) comes two weeks before negotiators from nearly 200 countries meet in Paris for a new round of negotiations aimed at reaching a legal agreement next year to end plastic pollution.

It lays out a three-pronged plan based on reuse, recycling and diversifying the materials used -- to help slash plastic pollution 80 percent by 2040 overall and cut single-use plastic production by half.

The report cited research estimating plastic could emit 19 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.

That would essentially prevent the world from meeting its Paris Agreement commitment to limit the rise in the planet's average temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level.

""The way we produce, use and dispose of plastics is polluting ecosystems, creating risks for human health and destabilising the climate,"" said Inger Andersen, UNEP executive director.

- Reuse, recycle, replace -

In 2020, approximately 238 million metric tonnes (mmt) of waste from short-lived plastics -- like packaging that ends up in municipal waste -- was generated worldwide.

Roughly half of that was mismanaged -- for example dumped in the environment or burned.

Without significant changes, UNEP expects annual plastic waste to reach 408 mmt by 2040, including 380 mmt of new fossil-fuel-based plastics. That would mean some 227 mmt of plastics would end up in the environment.

The report estimates that with a range of ""systems change"" solutions, that pollution figure could be reduced to 41 mmt.

But the report says there is no time to waste.

""The next three to five years present a critical window for action to set the world on the path towards implementing the systems change scenario by 2040,"" it warned.

Reuse in particular was identified as the most effective measure -- cutting plastic pollution up to 30 percent by 2040 -- with the introduction of things like refillable water bottles, packaging take-back schemes and ""reverse vending machines"".

While governments have to incentivise the shift, consumers will have to ""forego convenience of disposable and get used to products looking less shiny"".

Better recycling could cut pollution by a fifth, the report found, while replacing plastics with alternatives, like paper or other compostable materials, could help cut waste another 17 percent.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689840/Coming-years-critical-to-slash-plastic-pollution:-UN,2023-05-18 10:39:31,daily-sun
1128,Worst conditions for Canada wildfires yet to come: Alberta official,"With temperatures rising and little chance of rain, Canada's Alberta province was preparing Sunday for the worsening of wildfires that have raged for over a week and forced thousands to flee.

""We are continuing to see hot and dry conditions today with a low chance of rain throughout most of Alberta,"" said Josee St-Onge with the western province's wildfire agency.

Over half a million hectares (1.2 million acres) have already burned in Alberta, where there are still 87 active fires, of which 24 are still considered uncontrolled, St-Onge said.

""Our peak burning period, which is when the temperatures are at their highest and the fuels are at their driest, is still in front of us,"" she said.

In addition to the hundreds of reinforcements who have arrived from across Canada to help fight the fires, including from the army, 200 people from nearby US states have joined in, according to St-Onge.

New evacuation orders have been issued over the weekend, Alberta Emergency Management chief Colin Blair said, bringing the total number of evacuees to over 19,000.

""The wildfire situation is extremely volatile,"" Blair said.

In recent years, western Canada has been hit repeatedly by extreme weather, the intensity and frequency of which have increased due to global warming.

Forest fires in Canada's oil sands region in 2016 disrupted production and forced out 100,000 residents from Fort McMurray, pummeling the nation's economy.

In 2021, British Columbia suffered record-high temperatures over the summer that killed more than 500 people, as well as wildfires that destroyed an entire town.

That was followed by devastating floods and mudslides.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/689472/Worst-conditions-for-Canada-wildfires-yet-to-come:-Alberta-official,2023-05-18 10:39:31,daily-sun
1129,"Greenpeace, islanders launch legal action against Dutch","Greenpeace and residents of the Caribbean island of Bonaire have launched legal action against the Dutch government to protect it from rising sea levels, the environmental group said on Thursday.

The seven residents of the tiny Dutch territory and Greenpeace served The Hague with a formal legal warning, which is the final step before taking them to court, Greenpeace said.

""In the letter they demand that the government protects Bonaire against the consequences of climate change,"" Greenpeace said in a statement.

""The summons letter is the last warning to the government to quickly reduce CO2 emissions and to take concrete measures to keep Bonaire safe. Now and in the future.""

Under Dutch law the delivery of the warning letter is the first legal step to bringing the state to justice for climate change, Greenpeace spokesman Bram Karst told AFP.

""I see that climate change is having an effect on Bonaire, even though our island is small and so are our emissions,"" Jackie Bernabela, a 65-year-old teacher who lives on Bonaire, said in the letter.

""Residents of Bonaire should not be treated as second-rate Dutch citizens, we are entitled to be treated equally,"" added Onnie Emerenciana, 60, a gardener and Bonaire resident.

In 2010 it became one of three so-called special municipalities of the Netherlands along with Saba and St Eustatius.

The low-lying Netherlands is known for its climate adaptation measures such as a huge network of dikes to protect against the North Sea, but it is also one of Europe's biggest emitters in proportion to its population.

Climate action has increasingly become an issue for international justice.

1131,First baby with DNA from three people born in the UK,"In a groundbreaking scientific first for the UK, the first baby created with DNA from three people has been born, BBC reported. In this procedure, 99.8% of the DNA comes from the two parents, with the rest from a female donor. The pioneering technique is an attempt to prevent children from being born with devastating mitochondrial diseases.

Known as mitochondrial donation treatment (MDT), the technique uses tissue from the eggs of healthy female donors to create IVF embryos that are free from harmful mutations their mothers carry and are likely to pass on to their children.

The baby will have nuclear DNA from its mother and father which define key characteristics such as personality and eye colour. In addition, it will have a tiny amount of mitochondrial DNA provided by a female donor.

Doctors at the clinic in Newcastle in England's north-east where the breakthrough baby was born have not released details of birth from the MDT program.

Dagan Wells, a professor of reproductive genetics at the University of Oxford who took part in the UK breakthrough told The Guardian that the clinical experience with MRT was ''encouraging'' but the number of reported cases was ''far too small'' to draw any definitive conclusions about the ''safety or efficacy''.

The UK is not the first country to create babies from MDT. The first baby born via this technique was to a Jordanian family having treatment in the US in 2016.",,https://www.daily-sun.com/post/688621/First-baby-with-DNA-from-three-people-born-in-the-UK,2023-05-18 10:39:33,daily-sun
1132,World's most expensive mangoes at nearly $230 each,"Wearing a white tank top inside a foggy greenhouse at his farm in Otofuke on the island of Hokkaido in Japan, Hiroyuki Nakagawa plucks ripened mangoes ready to be packed and shipped. Outside the temperature is a freezing -8C on a clear December day, but inside the greenhouse the thermometer clocks in around 36C.

Nakagawa has been growing mangoes in the snowy Tokachi region of Japan's northernmost island since 2011. He sells them for as much as $230 each. He never thought an experiment in sustainable farming would one day yield the world's most expensive mangoes.

Nakagawa switched to mango cultivation following years in the oil business, where surging prices convinced him of the need to look beyond fossil fuels. Under the guidance of another mango farmer from the southern prefecture of Miyazaki, who claimed it was feasible to grow the fruit in winter months, Nakagawa founded his farm and established his startup Noraworks Japan. A few years later he trademarked his mango brand as Hakugin no Taiyo, which translates to ""Sun in the Snow.""

Nakagawa's secret is using the two natural resources his homeland of Hokkaido is famous for—snow and onsen hot springs. He stores snow from the winter months and uses it in the summer to cool his greenhouses, tricking the fruits into delaying blooming. Then in the winter he uses natural hot springs to warm the greenhouse and harvest roughly 5,000 mangoes out of season.

The process allows the mangoes to ripen during the cooler months when few insects are around, which means no use of pesticides. Hokkaido's low-humidity climate also reduces the need for mold-removing chemicals. Plus, harvesting in the winter—when farmers have less work—allows better access to labor at a time when Japan faces a worker shortage, particularly in rural areas.

The sustainable approach is just an added bonus to the taste, which Nakagawa claims is much sweeter than normal mangoes with a higher sugar content of about 15 degrees brix, and his fruit boasts a buttery smooth texture devoid of stringiness.

The novelty factor of how they're produced has intrigued customers and retailers alike. In 2014 the department store Isetan displayed one of his mangoes at its Shinjuku location in Tokyo, and it later sold for almost $400. The eye-popping price for a single mango made headlines, garnering more attention and making it a hard-to-get item. On the official website where customers can place orders, they're often greeted with the words ""SOLD OUT"" in a big, bold red font.

Since then, Nakagawa has discovered more unexpected benefits of farming in winter. ""Because we don't use pesticides, tea company Lupicia has approached me about using our leaves for mango tea,"" he says, gently patting a tree.

Nakagawa isn't satisfied yet. He aims to raise other tropical produce using the same method to turn Tokachi into a fruit production hub in winter and give the local economy a boost. Next he's eyeing another juicy fruit known for thriving in warmer climates: peaches.

""I like mangoes, but oh boy, I like peaches even more.""

1136,5 food combinations that can help lower cholesterol,"High levels of cholesterol can pose a great risk of heart disease and stroke. However, with high levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein), cholesterol one can develop fatty deposits in blood vessels which could make blood flow in arteries difficult

""Cholesterol is a major health concern globally, with an estimated 50% of adults suffering from high cholesterol levels. High cholesterol levels increase the risk of heart disease, which is one of the leading causes of death,"" Dietitian Garima Goyal said.

Goyal suggests food combinations that can help you manage cholesterol and keep your heart healthy.

1. Dal and Brown Rice

Dal is a staple in Indian cuisine and is packed with fibre, which helps to reduce LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein), often referred to as bad cholesterol. Brown rice is a great source of whole grains, which has been shown to lower the risk of heart disease by 20%.

2. Turmeric and Black Pepper

Turmeric is a spice that has been used in Indian cooking for centuries and has anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-lowering properties. A study published in the Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism found that taking a supplement containing turmeric and black pepper for 12 weeks significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol.

Almonds are a great source of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and protein, which can help to lower LDL cholesterol levels. A study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that eating yogurt can lower total cholesterol levels by up to 4%. Yogurt contains probiotics, which can help

to improve digestion and reduce inflammation. Together, these two foods make a satisfying and nutritious snack that can be enjoyed any time of day.

4. Green Tea and Lemon

Green tea is a popular beverage globally and is rich in antioxidants that can help to lower LDL cholesterol levels. Lemon contains flavonoids, which possess cholesterol-lowering properties. A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that consuming flavonoids like those found in lemons can help to reduce the risk of heart disease.

5. Garlic and Onion

Garlic and onion are staples in cooking and have both been shown to have cholesterol-lowering properties. Garlic contains allicin, which has been shown to reduce cholesterol levels, while onion contains quercetin, which can help to prevent the oxidation of LDL cholesterol. These two ingredients, when combined, are not just flavourful, but healthy in curries, soups, and gravies.

It's important to remember that making small changes to your diet and lifestyle can have a big impact on your health in the long run.

1162,Matarbari Deep-sea Port Can Transform Regional Growth Dynamics,"Since gaining their independence in 1971, Bangladeshis have lamented the lack of a deep-sea port comparable to those of Singapore, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, or India. The long-held ambition of a deep-sea port is gradually becoming a reality after 52 years of independence. Bangladesh is building a deep seaport at Cox's Bazar with funding from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to assist the nation in handling expanding volumes of exports and imports and relieve strain on the country's main seaport, Chattogram. Experts anticipate that Matarbari will soon surpass all other export-import hubs in the South Asian region in importance.

With the pandemic almost retreating, the dream deep-sea port project's construction work is going on in full swing. As part of the Matarbari Deep-Sea Port Development Project, a coal-fired power station, an LNG terminal, and roads will be built. The handling capacity is planned to increase significantly in the second phase from the first phase's handling capacity of up to 1 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). The project is likely to be completed by 2026. The Owusu Maru, a Panama ship with a 13-meter draught and a 228-meter length, docked at the deep-sea jetty of the Matarbari coal-fired power station on April 25 before the building work was finished, setting a record for the largest ship ever berthed at any port in the country.

The port is intended to serve as a significant transhipment hub linking Bangladesh with other countries in the area, boosting trade and business operations. Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe proposed the concept of an industrial hub in Bangladesh in 2020, centered on the construction of a deep-sea port in Matarbari. The Bay of Bengal region would benefit from the promotion of an industrial hub, which will promote development and help millions of people escape poverty, thanks to a recent $1.27 billion commitment from the country's current Prime Minister, Kishida.

A fertile hinterland of agricultural and mineral resources exists in the deltaic region to the north of the Bay of Bengal, waiting to be exploited. Road and rail connectivity to the deep-sea port might boost commerce and economic activity, potentially resulting in the formation of a future industrial growth belt comparable to those in East Asia. The region's economic landscape might be strengthened by infrastructure investments by luring private capital, multinational corporations, and mobile industries to the area. Emerging Asia, the world's fastest-growing region, could do business and invest in an industrial powerhouse in the Bay of Bengal.

Currently, no goods are shipped directly from Bangladesh to Europe. The cargo containers first travel to ports in Malaysia, Singapore, and Colombo. Later, it awaits a mother ship departing for Europe. As a result, shipping import-export commodities becomes much more expensive and time-consuming. Export goods will be able to travel directly from Matarbari to any port in Europe or America once the seaport is finished. The cost of doing business will go down as a result. For instance, currently, goods shipping from Bangladesh to the USA take 45 days to arrive. If the Matarbari port is opened, it will take just 23 days to get to the intended location.

The distance between Matarbari and other ports won't be too significant if a deep-sea port is built there. The maritime distances from Chittagong to Matarbari are 34 nautical miles; 190 nautical miles from Payra port to Matarbari; and 240 nautical miles from Mongla Port to the deep-sea port. As a result, products can be quickly moved to other ports by road and sea after being unloaded from the mother vessel (a huge container ship) at Matarbari.

If Matarbari Port is fully functional, it will contribute positively to the country's economy. JICA estimates that, as compared to Chittagong port, Matarbari terminal will save $131 on each 20-foot-long container delivered by sea. Additionally, a 40-foot container also saves roughly $197. According to statistics, the deep-sea port will boost the country's economy by 2–3 percent.

a) The deep-sea port would draw international shipping lines and develop into an important entry point for industries trading with countries in the vicinity. It is anticipated that this will lead to an increase in cross-border trade and business operations.

b) The project would need a sizable workforce to run, in addition to the boost it would give to local economic activity, which would result in sizable employment and income in the area.

c) The Matarbari deep-sea port will make it simple for businesses in the Bay of Bengal region to access international markets. It would be inevitable for Bangladesh to evolve into an industrial hub with Matarbari as its focal point.

d) The port project will necessitate the building of supporting infrastructure, including road, rail, and river networks, as well as other necessary amenities, enhancing intra-regional connections and sparking commercial activity for quick expansion.

In contrast to ASEAN and the European Union, South Asia has not undergone much regional trade integration. Even Bangladesh-India trade relations suffer numerous obstacles that prevent them from fully benefiting from greater trade integration between the two nations. As a result, due to a lack of trade and investment cooperation, the geographic advantage given by easy physical access to each other's markets and the resulting low transit cost of commerce have not been fully leveraged. Matarbari might alter that with complementary trade and infrastructure investment.

There are areas in India and Bangladesh that are primarily landlocked, heavily agricultural, have a higher than average rate of poverty, and are more susceptible to natural calamities. While several institutional and governmental restraints play a role in this phenomenon, research indicates that geographic distance from growth centers and vulnerability to natural catastrophes are two important contributing factors to the problems of the lagging regions.

Lack of infrastructure or fragmented infrastructure as well as trade restrictions and hurdles across borders, frequently results in isolation from growth centers. As an illustration, the eight states of North-East India (NEI) are cut off from India's economic hubs because of their physical distance, high transportation costs, and restricted transit options. Bangladesh’s growth impacts can reach NEI in a meaningful way in the years to come. However, increased trade and investment between Bangladesh and NEI via transit access to Bangladesh sea ports, not just for NEI but also for Nepal, Bhutan, and the littoral states surrounding the Bay of Bengal, can stimulate economic growth in the region. Finally, it can be said that the Matarbari deep-sea port could be a game changer for development in the Bay of Bengal region.

1163,Impact of Technological Globalization on University Students,"Technological globalization refers to the rapid diffusion and integration of technology, innovation, and knowledge across national borders. Advancements in communication, transportation, and information technology have accelerated this process. Technological globalization has transformed various aspects of modern society, from how people communicate and access information to how businesses operate and collaborate.

Technological globalization has far-reaching effects on communication, information access, trade, innovation, and culture, bringing opportunities and challenges. As the world becomes more digitally interconnected, addressing issues related to the digital divide, privacy, and security will be crucial to ensure that the benefits of technological globalization are shared equitably and sustainably.

The digital revolution has made vast amounts of information accessible to people worldwide. Online resources, such as search engines, e-books, and digital libraries, enable individuals to access knowledge and learning materials that were previously unavailable or difficult to obtain.

Technology has transformed global trade by enabling businesses to reach customers worldwide through e-commerce platforms, digital payment systems, and global logistics networks. It has led to increased competition, lower prices, and a greater variety of consumer goods and services.

Technological advancements have facilitated global collaboration and innovation, allowing researchers, scientists, and entrepreneurs to collaborate across borders, share ideas, and develop new products and services. It has led to the rapid diffusion of innovations and technologies, contributing to global economic growth and development.

While technological globalization has created numerous opportunities, it has also led to the digital divide – a gap between those with access to technology and those without access. This divide can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, as individuals without access to technology may be left behind regarding education, employment, and overall quality of life.

As technology becomes more integrated into everyday life, concerns about privacy and security have increased. The collection and storage of personal data by governments, businesses, and other entities raise questions about privacy rights, surveillance, and data protection. Additionally, the interconnected nature of technology has led to new challenges related to cyber security and the potential for cyber attacks.

Technological globalization has significantly impacted various aspects of Bangladesh's society, including university students' lives. The spread of technology and information access has transformed how students learn, interact, and prepare for their careers.

The internet has opened up a wealth of knowledge and resources for students. They can now access online journals, research papers, e-books, and educational platforms to enhance their learning experience, conduct research, and complete assignments more efficiently.

Technological advancements have led to the growth of e-learning and online education platforms, allowing students to take courses, attend lectures, and participate in discussions remotely. This flexibility enables them to learn independently and access educational content from prestigious institutions worldwide.

As the global job market demands new skills and competencies, university students in Bangladesh need to develop digital skills to stay competitive. Familiarity with computer programs, coding languages, data analysis tools, and other digital technologies is crucial for their future careers.

Technology has facilitated global collaboration and networking among students, researchers, and faculty. University students in Bangladesh can now connect with their peers worldwide, share ideas, and participate in joint research projects, enhancing their learning experience and expanding their professional networks.

Social media platforms have become essential for university students to communicate, share information, and stay updated on academic and extracurricular events. They also use these platforms for networking, job searching, and building their professional online presence.

Technological globalization has made it easier for students to explore career opportunities, apply for internships, and search for jobs online. Online platforms like LinkedIn help students connect with potential employers and showcase their skills and achievements.

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become increasingly popular among university students in Bangladesh. These courses, often offered by prestigious institutions, give students access to high-quality education and a chance to learn from renowned faculty members.

Despite the many benefits of technological globalization, challenges persist. Some students may lack access to technology, high-speed internet, or digital skills, which can exacerbate existing inequalities. Concerns about online privacy, data security, and cyber bullying can impact students' well-being.

While technological globalization has created numerous opportunities for university students, it has also introduced some negative impacts. Here are some of the key concerns and challenges faced by university students as a result of technological globalization:

The digital divide refers to the gap between those with access to technology and the internet and those without access. Students lacking access to digital resources may be disadvantaged compared to their peers, leading to inequality in educational outcomes and future career prospects.

The vast amount of information available online can be overwhelming for students. The constant exposure to online resources and the need to stay updated can lead to stress, anxiety, and difficulty focusing on their studies.

The increased reliance on digital communication tools may reduce face-to-face social interactions among students. This lack of personal interaction can impact their interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, and overall well-being.

Easy access to online resources and information can increase plagiarism and academic dishonesty among students. With the availability of essay writing services, online databases, and various resources, students may be tempted to cheat or plagiarize, ultimately harming their educational growth and integrity.

Using technology and social media platforms raises concerns about privacy and security. Students may be vulnerable to identity theft, cyber bullying, or harassment online, which can have severe consequences for their mental health and well-being.

Excessive use of technology, social media, and online gaming can lead to addiction and adversely impact students' mental health. Constant exposure to screens can result in sleep disturbances, increased stress levels, anxiety, and depression.

1164,Equal education leads to better society,"Education is known to be the strongest when voices and diverse perspectives are being heard and shared around the community. It is vital that young people are given a space and safety to express themselves without feeling ashamed. The idea of special education is governed by the concept that education is for all. It is true that not everyone learns the same way hence teachers in institutions should examine how a child learns and what struggles they face regularly.

A system called SEN (special educational need) was developed to help individuals who needed it learn more effectively. Special needs that are not met are a problem in Bangladesh and other countries. More support is needed to guarantee that kids with SEN have the same learning opportunities as students without SEN. Due to hidden or neurodivergent difficulties, special education children may need instructional adaptations.

By focusing on attentive learning and incorporating hands-on activities and visual aids into their lessons, teachers can assist students with unique educational needs. To monitor the student's development, a specific mentor should be appointed. The students should undergo routine health examinations in schools, and there are programmes in the US and UK for the less poor. Schools have connections to professionals who can aid in the education of children with SEND, and teachers are skilled at assisting pupils who are having difficulty learning.

The most crucial information to take is that children with special needs frequently encounter discrimination, bullying, and social injustice. Parents should try to offer them emotional support as well as educate others about SEN and promote awareness of it. All schools and teachers should receive special education needs training, and colleges should include this topic in their curriculum. Using a variety of learning techniques, including read-and-write, kinaesthetic, auditory, and visual, teachers and parents can support their children's academic performance. SEN students often struggle with a variety of issues, including behavioural issues, physical challenges, emotional challenges, etc. SEN faces various new opportunities by addressing needs and marginalise educational needs.

Those who are categorised of having learning difficulties was even worth of education. Students in mainstream school yet experience difficulties when it comes to having support at school. Obstacle to supply quality literacy is to overcome in the future. It is a challenge for SEN students to learn the same content without extra support. They will need more time and teachers and parents should be patient enough to encourage and motivate the child towards learning.

1165,Beyond Calling and Texting: Endless Potential of Mobile Phones,"Mobile Phones have become omnipresent in our lives, and it is hard to imagine a day without them. From communication to entertainment, these handheld devices have transformed the way we interact with the world around us. Nonetheless, the impact of cellphones goes far beyond just making phone calls and sending text messages. This piece aims at exploring some of the amazing ways that cellphones are shaping our world. So buckle up and get ready to discover all-important uses and effects of this technology that we often take for granted.

Before going into details, let us look at the evaluation of this identical-looking rectangular slab gadget in brief. On April 3, 1973, Martin Cooper, the then lead researcher at a radio and electronics company called Motorola made a breakthrough call over his cellphone to the rival researcher Joel Engel, an American engineer who was pursuing an effort to invent the world's first handheld mobile phone, on his landline at his laboratory. Fifty years ago, Cooper’s triumphant call to Engel was claimed to be the first-ever handheld mobile phone call.

Since the early days of smartphones, the integration of various features such as internet browsers, cameras, location services, torches, Bluetooth and accelerometers has become increasingly prevalent. This bundling of technologies has been on the rise ever since.

Modern smartphones have morphed into all-in-one devices, serving as banking hubs, personal assistants, and portable cinema and music players. They also integrate a range of sensors, including gyroscopes, barometers, thermometers, magnetometers, infra-red sensors and fingerprint sensors.

Over the past several years, mobile internet speed has improved by leaps and bounds, thanks to the rolling out of 5G technology. The combination of internet speed, the sheer computational power packed into phones and innovative software apps have paved the way for innovative ways of using these devices.

The GPS technology embedded in phones enables us to utilize them as navigation systems (sat-navs). By exploiting the vibration functions found in many contemporary smartphones, researchers have developed digital tactile maps that can be used by individuals with visual impairments to navigate their surroundings through touch.

Mobile apps have opened a new vista for medics to learn about the complex functioning of the human body with a few pinches and swipes. On the other hand, it has gamified language learning so the learners can learn with pleasure.

With digital infrastructure in place, owning a mobile phone has been transformative. It has brought together the service provider and service seeker, almost eliminating the intermediary altogether. Business cards may become a thing of the past as mobile phone numbers or WhatsApp numbers become a commonly used means of contact. The service provider, such as a plumber, an electrician, a repairperson, a cook, or a car mechanic, gives their mobile number to clients along with a fair bit of reliability. This practice has transformed the entire process of seeking labor of any kind.

Mobile phones also have given leeway and safety to the people, especially women. For instance, without physically having to go anywhere, without worrying about what they are wearing, people can participate and access all kinds of conversations on mobile phones.

Cellphones have become a powerful tool for ordinary people, allowing them to report on events that may be overlooked or inaccessible to mainstream media. The ability to document and share evidence of human rights abuses instantly through mobile phones has empowered anyone to engage in citizen journalism. In many cases, this has led to the viral dissemination of such evidence, which puts pressure on the people in authority to swing into action. Moreover, with social media access at their fingertips through smartphones, ordinary citizens have turned into potential whistle-blowers who can capture and share information that may not be accessible to the law or traditional media.

Mobile phones have brought about a dynamic shift in political engagement among the masses. Nowadays, politics is more issue-based than ideology-based. People are increasingly inclined towards the larger human rights irrespective of party ideology. Facebook warriors often take to the platform over hot button issues, chip in with their opinions to drum up support for a common cause and even raise hell against anomalies or discriminations.

In today's world, the adage of not underestimating the power of the pen has evolved to encompass the potency of a single SMS, tweet, or meme.

However, the bedrock of all these advancements continues to be internet connectivity. By dint of reliable internet connections and affordable data packages, remote communities in a country can take part in the small- and medium-sized business activities using mobile phones.

Besides, with affordable talk-time packages, even basic cellphone users can stay in touch with employers or near ones they leave behind for the sake of livelihood.

Overall, everything that one can possibly need is now in the palm of our hand. According to futurists, the rapid advancement of technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, biotechnology, quantum physics, supercomputers, and space exploration will greatly dwarf the innovations we have witnessed to date. The same rings true for mobile phones and its applications. And we cannot even imagine what the future of cellphone will be like.

1166,Rohingya Repatriation Key to Regional Peace and Stability,"No ocean is in need of strategic stability in general more than the Indian Ocean which is surrounded by 37 countries with 1/3 world population relatively young. This is the demographic and strategic hub of the 21st century. In particular, the Bay of Bengal needs greater stability since it is at the crossroads of SAARC and ASEAN and intertwined within BIMSTEC. Instability in the Bay of Bengal will affect both South and South-East Asia. The main political goals of the countries in this part are stability, economic emancipation and better lives for their people. Any instability or threat to stability will seriously impede the political goals.

Meanwhile, the Bay of Bengal is geopolitically getting volatile with two regional and potential world powers where China would like to protect her energy security through a pivot country like Myanmar. Roughly 14% of China’s energy is transported through Myanmar where China spent billions of dollars on energy infrastructure. India also involved roughly a billion dollars for connectivity to her eastern states partly through the Bay of Bengal (Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project). These initiatives for socio-economic development will be seriously affected by geopolitical rivalry between QUAD (India, US, Australia, Japan) and China in the Bay of Bengal. Apart from these, any conflict in this area will be politicised into geopolitical spare hampering quick resolution and the Rohingya issue is no exception. The other issue is, any kind of security situation in the littoral nations here will have ramification in the trade and commerce that involves the use of sea routes in the Bay of Bengal.

So how is Rohingya repatriation linked to geopolitical ambit? Besides many issues, this particular issue has also been linked to the global and regional geopolitical landscape. On the global stage, China and Russia have sided with Myanmar on the Rohingya issue where the West has a different position. At the regional level though both China and India have taken the side of Myanmar which is also for geostrategic purposes. However, the future may turn different as Junta in Myanmar will more and more enter into the fold of China due to international pressure. At the local level, the dynamics are a little different. The National Unity Government (NUG) would like to resolve the Rohingya issue at the Union level under the present circumstances. However, United League of Arakan (ULA) and Arakan Army’s (AA) internal politics are not so welcoming to Rohingya repatriation. AA is quite powerful and controls 60%-70% of Rakhine (where ultimately Rohingyas will return) but their source of power is China. So repatriation of Rohingyas does not depend entirely on AA alone. Junta expelled the Rohingyas and swallowing them back does not go with the psyche of Sir Gen Min Aung Hla though we notice some drama of the repatriation initiative with Chinese mediation. China would like to signal Bangladesh, which is calling the shots. If Bangladesh wants to resolve the Rohingya refugee issue, it is China. In the big picture, Bangladesh tilting towards India is likely to face arm twisting with the Rohingya repatriation issue.

How important is Rohingya Repatriation for peace and stability of the Bay of Bengal?

The Rohingya refugees are located in the South Eastern part of Bangladesh in the tri-border region (Bangladesh-India-Myanmar). This has been a charged area for a long time. There are dozens of insurgents/separatist groups of these three countries operating there. No government could bring them under effective control. The porous border, rugged terrain, lack of communication, unfriendly/indifferent to administration population and lack of economic activities/employment are some of the causes of gun culture prevailing here. Earlier, drug cultivation like poppy and marijuana were cash crops for these exotic groups, now Amphetamine Type Stimulant (ATS) production is the main source of resources for almost all armed groups. However, being sparsely populated, the recruitment supply was limited in the area.

Now there are 1.2 million Rohingya refugees available of which 400 thousand are children and young adults. By 2030 most of them will be adults. Without proper education, hope and dream they will be a readily available target group to be sucked into the vortex of the volatile environment. The dangerous part is these children are loaded with trauma, they have experienced the horrors of their lives and many have seen their mothers being violated. With trauma in their minds and hatred in their hearts what they could turn into if exploited only time can say. As a student of security studies, I keep on saying this is a ‘ticking time bomb’. Then this is not going to be a problem for Bangladesh alone it will have regional and even global ramifications. Besides we shall see non-traditional security issues i.e. drug proliferation in this region at an exponential rate, arms smuggling, human trafficking, boat people and sea robbery/piracy may surface making the Bay of Bengal unsafe and expensive for trade and commerce which will equally affect both regional powers including their strategic goals. Over time there could be a stage of desperation where various armed groups would surface from within Rohingyas and carry out activities inside Myanmar that could give rise to strain Bangladesh-Myanmar relationships causing traditional security concerns. Under the circumstance of both traditional and non-traditional threats, the peace, security and stability of the Bay of Bengal will be at stake.

There is another dimension surfacing in the South East of Bangladesh which is likely to have a religious connotation. The Kuki Chin National Front Army (KNFA) is 100% Christian. There are similar groups with similar mindsets in Myanmar and the Indian side of the border. Rohingyas are almost 100% Muslims located in the same area of operations. If a religious recipe enters, it will open a new Pandora’s Box. However, it is too early to comment and propose or predict.

1167,Sheikh Hasina's Homecoming Day: An Essential Turning Point for Bangladesh,"On May 17, 1981, Prime Minister Jononetree Sheikh Hasina made her long-planned homecoming to Bangladesh after an inadvertent exile abroad since the gloomy August of 1975. Every year on May 17, ""Hasina's homecoming day"" is generally honoured by all Bangladesh Awami League leaders, supporters and common people. The day has become prominent in Bangladesh's history due to numerous incidents. The information below will help us understand the setting and significance of ""Hasina's homecoming day."" The Juba League leader Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and the residents of Bangabandhu's brother-in-law, cabinet member Serniabat, were attacked by anti-liberation terrorists on the tragic August 15, 1975. By the mercy of the Almighty Allah, Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, the two daughters and inheritors of Bangabandhu and Bangamata's sacred blood, were among those who survived the assassinations. Most people know these events because they are now a part of our nation's history. Such horrific events plunged our Choto Apa Sheikh Rehana and Jononetree Sheikh Hasina into a chaotic, dark world of suffering. On the other hand, the issue of their safety grew more urgent because killers were on the prowl for Bangabandhu's blood heirs. The account of how they escaped and protected themselves for six years after the August slaughter before returning to the nation on May 17, 1981, could not be described in even the most incredible fiction.

The assassins of Bangabandhu and his family were carried out by certain Pakistani followers, notably Khondaker Mushtaq Ahmed, Taheruddin Thakur, and Ziaur Rahman, even though uniformed military officers could be seen on TV shortly after the murders. mobile-details-after-main-image The late Bangladeshi ambassador to West Germany, Humayun Rashid Chowdhury, supported Bangabandhu's daughters through a trying time in our nation's history. The non-aligned leaders of the moment, Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia and Indira Gandhi of India provided political sanctuary to Bangabandhu's daughters. They were shocked and devastated by Bangabandhu's death because they were his close friends and supporters. To express their gratitude to the two leaders for the invitation, the daughters of the Father of the Nation travelled to New Delhi, India. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family were assassinated by Pakistan's ghosts, causing the nation unmatched international shame.

The constant drive of Sheikh Hasina to create the golden Bengal that Bangabandhu envisioned is still in operation. The homecoming of Sheikh Hasina is a turning point for the democratic and secular outlook of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's supporters. The most significant legacy left by Bangabandhu is Sheikh Hasina. She likely inherited Bangabandhu's blood and leadership skills, which are not special or miraculous. Her leadership has ushered in brilliant prospects by piercing the long-lasting gloom that enveloped Bangladesh's fortune. The Prime Minister and President of the Awami League, Sheikh Hasina, appears to be the nation's dependable saviour in a catastrophic turn of events. She has persevered through many horrible tragedies to inspire hope in her people. She's been a tenacious foe in every catastrophe. She is now unrivalled as a leader in the nation after ensuring the safety of hundreds of millions of people during trying times. Of course, rating agencies have anticipated it, and such analysis has been conducted for a very long period in the international media. Nobody can assert that the democratic political strategy of Bangladesh has always had a clear course. After Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated on August 15, 1975, the military rulers tended to emulate the Pakistani government to run Bangladesh, which had gained its independence at a high price—the lives of millions—of people. Ziaur Rahman, who had unlawfully seized control of the government after Bangabandhu's passing, intended to establish a Pakistani-style government in Bangladesh.

Sheikh Hasina, the eldest child of Bangabandhu, was chosen by a national council to lead the Bangladesh Awami League in the early 1980s. Sheikh Hasina returned to Bangladesh after taking over the party's leadership, against the military regime's objections. She should lead the nation during a crisis; it only makes sense. A brilliant spark by the name of Sheikh Hasina endured in the face of terrible grenade attacks. She has committed her entire life to aiding the working people of Bangladesh. Her political stance is entirely focused on promoting the needs of the populace. She is constantly committed to creating the Sonar Bangla in Bangabandhu's likeness, representing the liberal, democratic, and secular Bangladesh that the liberation war created. The political slogan of Sheikh Hasina is ""improve the standard of people's lives."" Here are a few instances of her dynamism and commitment as a top leader. The prime minister of our nation, Sheikh Hasina, took over as the coronavirus pandemic spread over the globe. Bangladesh is a leader in the world of disaster management. Except for those under the health ministry, none of the government's offices, schools, or educational institutions were operational. The expansion of thorough corona detection tests, the creation of specialized corona hospitals and isolation centres, the deployment of armed forces alongside the civil administration to monitor compliance with hygiene and social distancing regulations, and the strengthening of relief programs to ensure food assistance to the poor and day labourers were also implemented by her. Despite having a crew, she handled every aspect of the job individually. I am talking about the commander-in-chief's loneliness since she is crucial in every battle. The prime minister proposed a Tk 72,000 crore incentive for manufacturing. The amount was later raised to about Tk1,000 crore. This kind of support has been applied in several circumstances. When others were free to go for their personal areas, she kept her office open.

Sheikh Hasina, who had dubbed herself a Pilot who could not sleep, was the one who promoted the corona-fighting rampage. She frequently held video conferences with government representatives and gave them precise directions, which eased citizens all around the nation. Similar discussions between Jononetree Sheikh Hasina and Asian leaders took place intending to bring down Covid-19 and defend South Asians. On the other side, Bangladeshis are fortunate to have a visionary, vivacious, and sincere leader in Sheikh Hasina. Without first witnessing her exceptional leadership, no one would have any reason to think Sheikh Hasina could govern a developing or third-world nation. According to the Forbes article, the 161 million-person nation of Bangladesh, which is led by Sheikh Hasina, has seen multiple crises. She responded to this one immediately with an ""admirable"" response. The longest-serving Prime Minister in the nation, Sheikh Hasina, allegedly made the necessary arrangements for the early February 2020 repatriation of trapped Bangladeshis. She closed down educational institutions when the first coronavirus infection was identified in early March and mandated that non-emergency business transactions be made online. She subsequently set up corona detectors at international airports to see if anyone was exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19. A total of 650,000 people were examined, with 37,000 being immediately quarantined. The quoted paper said many strong nations had yet to implement these programs. Only the undisputed leader Bangabandhu, the Father of the Nation during the liberation war, and the Mujibnagar government he headed can be compared in terms of how she and her administration responded to the coronavirus.

Sheikh Hasina’s courageous battle against the Covid epidemic, in which she has realized that fear does not fit her, is a tribute to all Bangladeshi men and women. The Prime Minister took action simultaneously to prevent the corona epidemic from halting the rate at which she had expanded the economy and enhanced people's lives. Sheikh Hasina has completed the electrification of all lands in the nation. She completed building the Padma Bridge despite the World Bank withholding funding. Bangladesh's economy, social structure, culture, tradition, and digital infrastructure have all improved under Sheikh Hasina to a new level. She has demonstrated Bangladesh's capacity for economic growth to the rest of the world. More than sincerity and honesty are the foundations of Sheikh Hasina's influence. She thinks that we Bengalis can succeed in our goals. Sheikh Hasina repeatedly cites that ""no powerful nation can make us kneel and give in because we won through a liberation war."" Sheikh Hasina's magic operates in this manner. Her return home greatly contributed to Bangladesh's highest level of growth. Her guiding principle propelled her to international renown in the twenty-first century. I and hundreds of millions of others think Sheikh Hasina can continue winning internationally. Be at peace with her always. Let's pray for Jononetree Sheikh Hasina's long life and good health.

1168,Nuremberg exhibition and movie screening at Russian Embassy in Dhaka,"On November 20, 1945, the trials over major Nazi war criminals began in Nuremberg, which went down in history as the Verdict of Nations. Our country as the liberator of Europe from the Nazi plague was one of the originators of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg.

It was legally based on the Declaration of the Responsibility of the Hitlerites for the Atrocities Committed, which was approved at the Moscow Conference in 1943, and the Agreement for the Prosecution and Punishment of the Major War Criminals of the European Axis signed by the USSR, the United States, the United Kingdom and France in 1945.

The Nuremberg Tribunal was held to bring a harsh but fair judgment to the Nazi criminals and also to promote a comprehensive assessment of the tragic lessons of the Second World War and the causes of the misanthropic ideology of Nazism. The Tribunal made an invaluable contribution to the

creation of the modern legal framework and to ensuring the inviolability of the global historical foundation of the Great Victory.

The Nuremberg Trials hold everlasting historical importance: they exposed heinous crimes by Nazism and militarism to the whole world and demonstrated the danger of them being revived in any form.Clearly, the Nuremberg Tribunal’s legacy is not limited to law, but has enormous political, moral and educational value. A strong vaccination against the revival of Nazism in all its forms and manifestations was made 75 years ago.

Regrettably, the effectiveness of the vaccine against Nazism created during the international trials has greatly decreased. Nazis and their accomplices have not only been justified but the ideology and practices of the Third Reich have been revived in several European countries, above all Ukraine and the Baltics, on a new, national-state, basis. The bloodthirsty activities of the Ukrainian neo-Nazis in Donbass and the regions controlled by the criminal Kiev regime are the grim evidence of this.

Russia will continue to vigorously and consistently oppose any attempts to falsify history, to glorify Nazi criminals and their henchmen, and to oppose the revision of the internationally recognized outcomes of World War II, including the Nuremberg rulings. The overwhelming majority of the international community members agree with us in this regard.

a revision of the results of the Second World War, and preserve the historical memory of the heroic and tragic pages in the history of Russia and the world.

The exhibition on the Nuremberg trials and the first Russian feature film, Nuremberg, are expected to make a major contribution to combating the falsification of history and to demonstrate that crimes against humanity have no statute of limitations.

1169,Bangladesh Needs Hasina’s Leadership to Achieve Prosperity,"The title of my today’s write-up is the comment of the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva. She said so on 29 April 2023 while she called on Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is now in Washington on an official tour to attend the celebration of Bangladesh’s 50 years of partnership with the World Bank. The IMF Chief lauded the leadership of Sheikh Hasina in transforming Bangladesh into a role model of development that already attracted the world. She highly praised the unprecedented advancement of Bangladesh in various sectors under the dynamic and bold leadership of Sheikh Hasina, which has made country’s economy stable even after the Covid-19 pandemic.

While appreciating Sheikh Hasina’s leadership, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva said that the leadership like her is necessary to go ahead with prosperity confronting all hurdles. She also said that Bangladesh has achieved remarkable progress due to massive infrastructure development, widespread connectivity and maintenance of the law and order. The Bangladesh premier briefed the IMF Chief of her government’s activities for the country’s overall development, including initiatives to face the effects of climate change and ensure women empowerment.

On May 1, while addressing the plenary session on ‘Reflection on 50 years of World Bank-Bangladesh partnership’, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina placed five specific suggestions before the World Bank that need to be taken into consideration by the global lender. She sought cooperation from the World Bank for Bangladesh’s smooth transition towards a developing nation, subsequent graduation to upper-middle income country and implementation of its Delta Plan-2100. Mentioning the ongoing global crises caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, conflicts in different parts of the world and climate emergency, she said that these have put many countries under economic stress. She urged the World Bank and other development partners to find viable alternatives so that economies of those countries can come out of the emerging challenges.

Sheikh Hasina informed the session that Bangladesh has emerged as a global role-model in disaster management. While describing Bangladesh as a living laboratory of climate adaptation, she said, “I invite the World Bank and other development partners to join us in implementing the projects under our Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100.” She raised the Rohingya issue and said that not a single Rohingya could be repatriated though Bangladesh has been working with the UN and other international agencies for their safe, dignified and voluntary repatriation to their own land, Myanmar. There must be a permanent solution to this issue. However, she thanked the World Bank for its grants for these Rohingya people.

The World Bank has committed to provide US$2.25 billion in credit support to Bangladesh to facilitate its five development projects, according to the agreement signed during the visit. The World Bank President also reaffirmed its fullest supports and cooperation for Bangladesh that has been navigating unprecedented global challenges. Expecting World Bank’s support, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said, “In the past 50 years, the World Bank remained a steadfast development partner and supported our aspirations. We hope to work together with the World Bank as Bangladesh progresses to achieve higher-income country status by 2041.”

After opening of a photo exhibition there, the Bangladesh Prime Minister and the World Bank President walked through some of the key elements of the exhibition. The exhibition, in fact, has placed, in front of the world community, the determination of her government in turning Bangladesh into a resilient and prosperous land. Sheikh Hasina said that the exhibition is also about the importance of making the right political choices. She also recalled that Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman wished to see such kind of smile on the face of his distressed people.

We know that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, after paying her four-day bilateral visit to Japan, is now in the USA at the invitation of the World Bank President David R. Malpass. She is scheduled to leave the USA on 4 May for the UK, where she will attend the coronation ceremony of King Charles III to be held on 6 May. She will return on 9 May.

I am not going to describe other events of her visit to the USA. If we analyse the discussions of only the two meetings (one with the IMF and the other with the World Bank), we can clearly observe that how much confident they keep on the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. This trust has not come automatically or through other means, she has to earn it through her charismatic and uncompromised leadership. Her role in the international field has also been praised by the world leaders and international institutions. They certainly believe that Sheikh Hasina is such a leader who has the courage and foresights to transform Bangladesh into a developed country. She is working in the right track to make a ‘Smart Bangladesh’, where her people will pass a dignified life without hunger or poverty anymore. Being a leader of the general mass, she has taken the responsibility to make her people smile, as dreamt by the Father of the Nation. They will not agree in any way that their leader will desert them. They want Sheikh Hasina to run the country for their own interest, which is nothing but a better life, a fearless environment and a bright prosperous Bangladesh.

There is no doubt that Sheikh Hasina’s enormous economic development and welfare activities have proved that Bangladesh needs a leader like her. That is why the people of Bangladesh have elected her to lead the country four times, which is the testimony of her able leadership. For her courageous and visionary role at the regional and international levels, Bangladesh is now considered as a role model of development for the whole world.

As Sheikh Hasina has urged the World Bank to continue their supports towards Bangladesh in its exciting journey ahead to build a ‘Smart Bangladesh’, we believe that the people of Bangladesh will also remain with her in that journey through their mandate in the coming national elections. And as said by the IMF Chief, Bangladesh needs the leadership of Sheikh Hasina to achieve prosperity. There is no alternative, at least at this moment.

1170,Historic May Day: Safeguarding Bangladeshi Workers’ Futures,"‘May Day’, also known as ‘Workers’ Day’ or ‘International Workers' Day’ is an important day for workers across the globe to reflect on the history of the labour movement and renew their commitment to the fight for a fair and just society. It is celebrated annually on May 1 to commemorate the struggles and achievements of the labour movement worldwide. This day has its roots in the historical struggles of workers who fought for better working conditions, fair wages and the right to organise collectively. In 1889, an international federation of socialist groups and trade unions designated May 1 as a day in support of workers, in commemoration of the Haymarket Riot in Chicago in 1886. The first May Day celebrations took place in the late 19th century, with workers in the United States and Europe staging protests and strikes to demand better treatment. At the present time, May Day remains an important day for workers across the world to rally together and raise awareness about the ongoing struggles and challenges faced by the labour movement. It is an opportunity to celebrate the victories of the past and to renew the struggle for their empowerment.

The significance of May Day lies in its recognition of the fundamental role that workers play in society and their right to fair treatment and economic security. Across the world, the position of the labourer has been historically marginalised, with workers often facing exploitation, unsafe working conditions and limited access to basic rights and benefits. The labour movement, of which May Day is a central part, seeks to address these issues and ensure that workers are given the dignity and respect they deserve.

Today, Bangladesh is home to one of the largest labour forces in the world, with millions of workers employed in various industries such as textiles, agriculture, and manufacturing. The garment industry is a vital part of the Bangladeshi economy, employing millions of workers, who are reportedly facing a range of issues such as long working hours, low wages, unsafe working conditions, and limited job security. Many workers are employed on a temporary basis and lack basic employment benefits such as health insurance, sick leave, and paid holidays. In 2013, the Rana Plaza disaster, which claimed the lives of over 1,100 garment workers, drew global attention to the dangerous working conditions in the industry. In response, there were protests and calls at home and abroad for better safety standards. In keeping with the main spirit of May Day, the workers of Bangladesh continue to fight for their rights and demand better treatment from employers and the government.

Since then, there have been some positive developments. For instance, many international brands and retailers have signed the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety in 2013, which aims to improve safety standards in the country’s garment industry. A number of other efforts have been taken to increase the minimum wage for garment workers, although this still falls short of a living wage. There have also been some reforms in the prevalent labour laws which are expected to ensure the restoration of the GSP facilities from the US that have been remaining suspended since 2013. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure that the conditions of workers in Bangladesh and across the world are in line with the main spirit of May Day. It is essential that they are able to organise and demand better treatment from their employers and the government. The right to form and join trade unions is an important aspect of workers' rights, and it is crucial that these rights are protected and respected.

The struggles of Bangladeshi workers in the garment industry have been the focus of many May Day celebrations in the country, with workers and labour activists coming together to demand better treatment and fair wages. Despite facing numerous challenges, Bangladeshi workers have continued to fight for their rights and push for reforms that can improve their working conditions and ensure that their voices are heard.

One of the key ways in which May Day has been significant in the context of Bangladesh and across the world is that it provides a platform for workers to come together and assert their rights. The ILO’s Decent Work agenda is a reflection of the May Day spirit. The Bangladesh Decent Work Country Program (DWCP) was developed in association with ILO’s tripartite constituents— government, Employer’s Federation and National Coordination Committee for Workers Education, and was implemented between 2017 and 2020. It focused on four key priorities i.e. effective employment policies to enhance employability through skill development; promotion of a safe and clean working environment for workers in compliance with international labour standards; promotion of fundamental principles and rights at work through social dialogue; and promotion of social protection for workers and vulnerable groups (ilo.org). Moreover, in continuation of the joint effort of the Bangladesh government and ILO to promote decent work, the DWCP 2022-2026 was launched on March 31, 2022, keeping the tripartite mechanism at the top of the agenda. It can be anticipated that its implementation will help develop decent work for all in Bangladesh working together with the government, employers, and workers for a common goal.

May Day is a significant day for workers around the world, and its message of solidarity and social justice remains relevant today. In Bangladesh, organised labour rights movements play important roles in advocating for the rights of workers, and it is important that these efforts are acknowledged and supported. As we continue to navigate the challenges of the 21st century, May Day serves as a reminder of the struggle for workers' rights and the importance of fighting for sustainable economies and equitable societies. This is what we need to safeguard the futures of Bangladeshi workers.
